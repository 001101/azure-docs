# Azure Cognitive Services offline containers

We're thrilled to offer Azure Cognitive Services "offline containers", available now in limited preview to customers with an *Enterprise Agreement*. Offline containers enable customers can run Cognitive Services in fully disconnected environments. You can use the same rich APIs that are available in Azure, with finite control of deployment and hosting. Cognitive Services containers offer many [features and benefits](../cognitive-services-container-support.md#features-and-benefits), such as:

* Control of your data.
* Low-latency execution of artificial intelligence (AI) models near application logic.
* Disconnected scenarios on the [intelligent edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/future-of-cloud).

## Use cases

There are many use cases for offline Cognitive Services containers, here are some of the more common use cases we've experienced. As general guidance, any scenario that requires being temporarily or indefinitely disconnected from the cloud could benefit from offline containers. The only question you need to ask yourself is, "do I want to build intelligence into my apps?".

### Transport services

Various transport services, such as luxury cruise lines *do not always* have connectivity to the cloud. Cognitive Services containers offer a huge opportunity to track sentiment of passengers, identify lost items, and even help with answering questions for customers. All these operations can run locally in real time, without being connected to the cloud.

### Retail intelligence

Offline containers support several retail scenarios, including helping to build a fluid checkout experience, developing product recommendation, and target advertising. Retailers can execute AI on-premises close to their data. Containers enable the possibility of running these operations by deploying them on-premises, for higher-level decision making in real time.

### IT automation

Offline containers can be used as recommendation engines for handling tickets and assigning them to the correct team. They could be used to detect sentiment within customer tickets and prioritize which scenarios need to get addressed first. Likewise, you could automate the resolution of tickets by troubleshooting and determining resolution without manual intervention.

## Customer eligibility

> [!NOTE]
> During preview, offline containers are limited to customers with an [Enterprise Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/enterprise) from Microsoft.

An approval process and decision will be made after validating business use cases for fully disconnected environments. Customers without an Enterprise Agreement, but who are still interested in offline containers should refer to the [FAQs](container-faq.md) to learn more.
