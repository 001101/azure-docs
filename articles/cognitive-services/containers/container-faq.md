# Azure Cognitive Services containers frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## General questions

<details>
<summary>
<b>What is available?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** [Container support in Azure Cognitive Services](../cognitive-services-container-support.md) allows developers to use the same intelligent APIs that are available in Azure, but with the [benefits](../cognitive-services-container-support.md#features-and-benefits) of containerization. Container support is currently available in preview for a subset of Azure Cognitive Services, including parts of:

> * [Computer Vision][cv-containers]
> * [Face][fa-containers]
> * [Form Recognizer][fr-containers]
> * [Language Understanding (LUIS)][lu-containers]
> * [Speech Service API][sp-containers]
> * [Text Analytics][ta-containers]

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>What is the difference between public preview, and generally available?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** As new Azure Cognitive Services offerings are introduced, they are first available as a "gated" public preview, which require an application to access. Once they go into an "ungated" public preview, they are publicly available to access from the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR), or Docker hub. After a container is officially released, it is classified as Generally Available. (GA). See the [gating process](../cognitive-services-gating-process.md) article for more information.

</details>


<details>
<summary>
<b>Is there any difference between the Cognitive Services cloud and the containers?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Cognitive Services containers are an alternative to the Cognitive Services cloud. Containers offer the same capabilities as the corresponding cloud services. Customers can deploy the containers on-premises or in Azure. The core AI technology, pricing tiers, API keys, and API signature are the same between the container and the corresponding cloud services. Here are the [features and benefits](../cognitive-services-container-support.md#features-and-benefits) for choosing containers over their cloud service equivalent.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>Will containers be available for all Cognitive Services and what are the next set of containers we should expect?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** We would like to make more Cognitive Services available as container offerings. Contact to your local Microsoft account manager to get updates on new container releases and other Cognitive Services announcements.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>What will the Service-Level Agreement (SLA) be for Cognitive Services containers?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** No SLA exists for Cognitive Services containers.

Cognitive Services container configurations of resources are controlled by customers, as such Microsoft does not offer a SLA. Customers are free to deploy containers on-premises, ultimately they define the host environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To learn more about Cognitive Services Service-Level Agreements, [visit our SLA page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cognitive-services/v1_1/).

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>Are these containers available in sovereign clouds?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Not everyone is familiar with the term "sovereign cloud", so let's begin with definition:

> The "sovereign cloud" consists of the [Azure Government](../../azure-government/documentation-government-welcome.md), [Azure Germany](../../germany/germany-welcome.md), and [Azure China 21Vianet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/china/overview-operations) clouds.

Unfortunately, the Cognitive Services containers are *not* natively supported in the sovereign clouds. The containers can be run in these clouds, but they will be pulled from the public cloud and need to send usage data to the public endpoint.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>How are containers updated to the latest version?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Customers can choose when to update the containers they have deployed. Containers will be marked with standard [Docker tags](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/) such as `latest` to indicate the most recent version. We encourage customers to pull the latest version of containers as they are released, checkout [Azure Container Registry webhooks](../../container-registry/container-registry-webhook.md) for details on how to get notified when an image is updated.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>What versions will be supported?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** The current and last major version of the container will be supported. However, we encourage customers to stay current to get the latest technology.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>How are updates versioned?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Major version changes indicate that there is a breaking change to the API signature. We anticipate that updates will generally coincide with major version changes to the corresponding Cognitive Service cloud offering. Minor version changes indicate bug fixes, model updates, or new features that do not make a breaking change to the API signature.

</details>

## Technical questions

<details>
<summary>
<b>How should I run the Cognitive Services containers on IoT devices?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Whether you don't have a reliable internet connection, or want to save on bandwidth cost. Or if have low-latency requirements, or are dealing with sensitive data that needs to be analyzed on-site, [Azure IoT Edge with the Cognitive Services containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/running-cognitive-services-on-iot-edge/) gives you consistency with the cloud.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>How do I provide product feedback and feature recommendations?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Customers are encouraged to [voice their concerns](https://cognitive.uservoice.com/) publicly, and up-vote others who have done the same where potential issues overlap. The user voice tool can be used for both product feedback and feature recommendations.

</details>

<details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>How does billing work?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Customers are charged based on consumption, similar to the Cognitive Services cloud. The containers send metering data to Azure, and transactions will be billed accordingly. Resources used across the hosted and on-premises services will add to single quota with tiered pricing, counting against both usages. For more detail, refer to pricing page of the corresponding offering.

* [Anomaly Detector][ad-containers-billing]
* [Computer Vision][cv-containers-billing]
* [Face][fa-containers-billing]
* [Form Recognizer][fr-containers-billing]
* [Language Understanding (LUIS)][lu-containers-billing]
* [Speech Service API][sp-containers-billing]
* [Text Analytics][ta-containers-billing]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cognitive Services containers are not licensed to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate billing information with the metering service at all times. Cognitive Services containers do not send customer data to Microsoft.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>What is the current support warranty for containers?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** There is no warranty for previews. Microsoft's standard warranty for enterprise software will apply when containers are formally announced as general availability (GA).

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>What happens to Cognitive Services containers when internet connectivity is lost?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Cognitive Services containers are *not licensed* to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate with the metering service at all times.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>How long can the container operate without being connected to Azure?</b>
</summary>

**Answer:** Cognitive Services containers are *not licensed* to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate with the metering service at all times.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<b>What is current hardware required to run these containers?</b>
</summary>
