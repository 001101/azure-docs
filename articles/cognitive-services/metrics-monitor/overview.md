# What is Metrics Monitor? 

Metrics Monitor is a time series monitoring platform that provides a set of APIs for data ingestion, anomaly detection, and diagnostics, without needing to know machine learning. Use Metrics Monitor to:
* Analyze multi-dimensional data from multiple data sources 
* Simplify model building & customization
* Identify and correlate anomalies
* Build scalable root cause analysis.
