# What is Metrics Monitor? 

Metrics Monitor is a time series monitoring platform that provides a set of APIs for data ingestion, anomaly detection, and diagnostics, without needing to know machine learning. Use Metrics Monitor to:
* Analyze multi-dimensional data from multiple data sources 
* Simplify model building & customization
* Identify and correlate anomalies
* Build scalable root cause analysis.

## Typical workflow

The workflow is simple: you submit data for analysis and handle outputs in your code. Analyzers are consumed as-is, with no additional configuration or customization.

1. [Create an Azure resource](../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) for Metrics Monitor. Afterwards, [get the key](../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#get-the-keys-for-your-resource) generated for you to authenticate your requests.
2. Try the demo site to see an example Metrics Monitor instance, with example data. 
3. Build your first monitor using the web portal.
4. Use the REST API or Client libraries to customize your instance.
