# Form Recognizer Layout Service

Azure Form Recognizer can extract text, tables, selection marks and strucutre information from documents using its Layout service. The Layout API enables customers to take document in a variety of formats and return structured data and represntation of the document. It combines our powerful [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-recognizing-text) capabilities with document understanding deep learning models to extract text, tables, selection marks and structure of documents. 

## What does the Layout service do?

The Layout API extracts text, tables, selection marks and strucutre information from documents with exceptional accuracy and returns them in an organized structured JSON response. Documents can be from a variety of formats and quality, including  phone-captured images, scanned documents, and digital PDFs. The Layout API will extract the structured output from all of these documents.

## Try it out

To try out the Form Recognizer Layout Service, go to the online Sample Tool:

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Try Prebuilt Models](https://fott-preview.azurewebsites.net/)

You will need an Azure subscription ([create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)) and a [Form Recognzier resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) endpoint and key to try out the Form Recognizer Invoice service.

### Input Requirements 

[!INCLUDE [input reqs](./includes/input-requirements-receipts.md)]

## The Analyze Layout operation

The [Analyze Layout](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1-preview-2/operations/AnalyzeLayoutAsync) operation takes a document (image, Tiff or PDF file) as the input and extracts the text, tables, selection marks and sturcutre of the document. The call returns a response header field called `Operation-Location`. The `Operation-Location` value is a URL that contains the Result ID to be used in the next step.

|Response header| Result URL |
|:-----|:----|
|Operation-Location | `https://cognitiveservice/formrecognizer/v2.1-preview.2/prebuilt/layout/analyzeResults/44a436324-fc4b-4387-aa06-090cfbf0064f` |

## The Get Analyze Layout Result operation

The second step is to call the [Get Analyze Layout Result](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1-preview-2/operations/GetAnalyzeLayoutResult) operation. This operation takes as input the Result ID that was created by the Analyze Layout operation. It returns a JSON response that contains a **status** field with the following possible values. 

|Field| Type | Possible values |
|:-----|:----:|:----|
|status | string | notStarted: The analysis operation has not started.<br /><br />running: The analysis operation is in progress.<br /><br />failed: The analysis operation has failed.<br /><br />succeeded: The analysis operation has succeeded.|

You call this operation iteratively until it returns with the **succeeded** value. Use an interval of 3 to 5 seconds to avoid exceeding the requests per second (RPS) rate.

When the **status** field has the **succeeded** value, the JSON response will include the layout extraction results, text, tables and selection marks extracted. The extracted data contains the extracted text lines and words, bounding box, text apearance handwritten indication, tables and selection marks with an indication selected \ unselected.
