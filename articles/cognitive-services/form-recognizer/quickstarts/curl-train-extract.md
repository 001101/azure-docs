#Customer intent: As a developer or data scientist familiar with cURL, I want to learn how to use Form Recognizer to extract my form data.

# Quickstart: Train a Form Recognizer model and extract form data using REST API with cURL

In this quickstart, you will train and score forms to extract key-value pairs and tables using Form Recognizer's REST API with cURL.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* You got access to the Form Recognizer limited-access preview. To get access to the preview, please fill out and submit the [Cognitive Services Form Recognizer access request](https://aka.ms/FormRecognizerRequestAccess) form. 
* You must have [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/windows/).
* You must have a subscription key for Form Recognizer. To get a subscription key, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Form Recognizer and get your key. 
* You must have a minimum set of five forms of the same type located on a blob to train a model or you can downlaod and extract to a blob container the [sample dataset](https://github.com/Azure/CSContainers/blob/master/FormUnderstanding/sample_data.zip) for this quickstart.

## Train a Form Recognizer model

First, you will need a training data. The training data can be the [sample data](https://github.com/Azure/CSContainers/blob/master/FormUnderstanding/sample_data.zip) located on an Azure Blob or your own training data. Training data should consist of a minimum of five forms (PDF documents and/or images) of the same type/structure or an empty form (the empty form's filename must include the word "empty") located on an Azure Blob container.

To train a Form Recognizer model using the documents in your Azure Blob container, call the **Train** API by executing the following cURL command. Before running the command replace the following: 
* Replace `<Endpoint URL>` with the Form Recognizer endpoint, you can find it in your Form Recognizer resource overview tab. 
* Replace `<SAS URL>` with an Azure Blob Storage container shared access signature (SAS) URL where the training data is located.  

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<Endpoint URL>/formrecognizer/v1.0-preview/custom/train" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" -d "{ \"source\": \"<SAS URL>\"}"
```

You will receive a `200 (Success)` response with the following JSON output:

```json
{
  "modelId": "9299792c-03b4-4eea-b83e-afa403fcb406",
  "totalPages": 5,
  "processReport": [
    {
      "dataRef": "Invoice_1.pdf",
      "errors": [],
      "pages": 1,
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "dataRef": "Invoice_2.pdf",
      "errors": [],
      "pages": 1,
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "dataRef": "Invoice_3.pdf",
      "errors": [],
      "pages": 1,
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "dataRef": "Invoice_4.pdf",
      "errors": [],
      "pages": 1,
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "dataRef": "Invoice_5.pdf",
      "errors": [],
      "pages": 1,
      "status": "success"
    }
  ],
  "trainReport": {
    "errors": [],
    "pages": 0,
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

Take note of the `"modelId"` value; you will need it for the following steps.
  
## Extract key-value pairs and tables from forms

Next, you will analyze a document and extract key value pairs and tables from it. Call the **model analyze** API by executing the following cURL command. Before running the command replace the following: 
* Replace `<Endpoint URL>` with the Form Recognizer endpoint, you can find it in your Form Recognizer resource overview tab. 
* Replace `<modelID>` with the modelID you received in the previous step of training the model.
* Replace `</path/to/my/Invoice_1.pdf>` with the path to the file you would like to analyze from the sample data. 
* Replace `<pdf>` with the file type you are analyzing supported options are - pdf, image/jpeg, image/png. 

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<Endpoint URL>/formrecognizer/v1.0-preview/custom/model/<modelID>/analyze" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "form=@</path/to/my/Invoice_1.pdf>;type=application/<pdf>"
```

### Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON and represents the extracted key-value pairs and tables for all documents in the dataset.

```bash
