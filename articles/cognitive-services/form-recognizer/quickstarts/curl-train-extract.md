#Customer intent: As a developer or data scientist familiar with cURL, I want to learn how to use Form Recognizer to extract my form data.

# Quickstart: Train a Form Recognizer model and extract form data using cURL

In this quickstart, you will train and score forms to extract key-value pairs and tables using Form Recognizer's REST API with cURL.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* You must have [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/windows/).
* You must have a subscription key for Form Recognizer. To get a subscription key, see Obtaining subscription keys.
* You must have a minimum set of five forms of the same type located in the container's mounted **/input** directory. You can use a [sample dataset](sample_data.zip) for this quickstart.

## Create a training dataset

First, you will send a request to process your training dataset. The dataset should consist of a minimum of five forms (PDF documents and/or images) of the same type/structure or an empty form (the empty form's filename must include the word "empty").

You create a dataset by calling the **Dataset** API and assigning to a mount location to the `dataRef` parameter.
To run the sample command, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following command into a text editor

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/forms/v1.0/dataset" --data "{\"name\": \"<dataset name>\",\"dataRef\": \"/input/<dataset path>\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```

1. Make the following changes:

   * Replace `<dataset name>` with a name for the dataset
   * Replace `<dataset path>` with the path to your training dataset

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `dataRef` parameter is always relative to the input mount root path, which is **/input** by default. Therefore, all `dataRef` attribute values are relative to this path. For example, if the value is `/input/dataset`, it's expected that the **/dataset** folder is present under the path that was mapped to **/input**.

1. Open a command prompt window, paste the command from the text editor, and run the command.
1. You should receive a `202 (Accepted)` response with the following JSON output:

   ```json
   {"purpose":"train","state":"created","id":1,"name":"<dataset name>","dataRef":"/input/<dataset path>"}
   ```

1. Copy the `"id"` value; you will need it for the following steps.

## Train a Form Recognizer model

To train a new Form Recognizer model using the documents in your dataset, call the **Train** API by executing the following cURL command. Replace `<id>` with your dataset ID:

```bash
curl -X POST --data "" "http://localhost:5000/forms/v1.0/dataset/<id>/train"
```

You will receive a `200 (Success)` response with the following JSON output:

```json
{"modelVersion":{"versionId":1,"modelId":1,"modelRef":"/output/datasets/<dataset name>/models/1260d261-2737-4b29-ac18-b578fab103b1.gz","isActive":true}}
```

Take note of the `"modelId"` value; you will need it for the following steps.
  
## Extract key-value pairs and tables from forms

Next, you will score all the documents in the dataset (batch scoring). Copy the following command, replacing `<model Id>` with your model ID and `<id>` with your dataset ID. Then execute the command.

```bash
curl -X POST --data "{\"modelId\": <model Id> }" "http://localhost:5000/forms/v1.0/dataset/<id>/score"
```

### Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON and represents the extracted key-value pairs and tables for all documents in the dataset.

```bash
