Extract data from Business Cards 

 

Azure Form Recognizer includes several Prebuilt models for unique form types and scenarios. These prebuilt models are pre-trained on our data and ready to use off the shelf— no manual data labeling or model training required.  

One of these Prebuilt models is our Prebuilt Business Card API. This API combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with our Business Card Understanding model to extract key information from business cards in English. We detect and extract personal contact info, as well as company name, job title, and more. The Prebuilt Business Card API is now publicly available in Form Recognizer v2.1-preview.1.
