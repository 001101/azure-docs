# What's new in Form Recognizer?

This article highlights the major changes that come with new versions of the Form Recognizer API.

> [!NOTE]
> The quickstarts and guides in this doc set always use the latest version of the API, unless they specify otherwise.

## Form Recognizer 2.0 (preview)

### Custom model API changes

All of the APIs for training and using custom models have been renamed, and some synchronous methods are now asynchronous. The following are major changes:

* The process of training a model is now asynchronous. You initiate training through the **/custom/models** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **custom/models/{modelID}** to return the training results.
* Key/value extraction is now initiated by the **/custom/models/{modelID}/analyze** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **custom/models/{modelID}/analyzeResults/{resultID}** to return the extraction results.
* Operation IDs for the Train operation are now found in the **Location** header of HTTP responses, not the **Operation-Location** header.

### Receipt API changes

The APIs for reading sales receipts have been renamed.

* Receipt data extraction is now initiated by the **/prebuilt/receipt/analyze** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **/prebuilt/receipt/analyzeResults/{resultID}** to return the extraction results.

### Output format changes

The JSON responses for all API calls have new formats. Some keys and values have been added, removed, or renamed. See the quickstarts for examples of the current JSON formats.

### Large data support

Your training data set for custom models can now be up to 50 MB in size.
