# What's New in Form Recognizer?

This article highlights the major changes that come with new versions of the Form Recognizer API.

> [!NOTE]
> The quickstarts and guides in this document set always use the latest API version, unless they specify otherwise.

## Form Recognizer 2.0 (preview)

### Custom model API changes

All of the APIs for training and using custom models have been renamed, some method signatures are different, and some synchronous methods are asynchronous. The following are major changes:

* Training is now asynchronous. You initiate training through the **/custom/models** API call. This returns an operation ID, which can be passed into **custom/models/{modelID}** to return the training results.
* Key/value extraction is now initiated by the **/custom/models/{modelID}/analyze** API call. This returns an operation ID, which can be passed into **custom/models/{modelID}/analyzeResults/{resultID}** to return the extraction results.

### Receipt API changes

The APIs for reading sales receipts have been renamed, and some method signatures are different.

* Receipt data extraction is now initiated by the **/prebuilt/receipt/analyze** API call. This returns an operation ID, which can be passed into **/prebuilt/receipt/analyzeResults/{resultID}** to return the extraction results.

### Large data support

Your training data set can now be up to 50 MB in size.
