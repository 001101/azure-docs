## Get LUIS key

[!INCLUDE [Use authoring key for endpoint](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-qs-endpoint-get-key-para.md)]

## Get intent with browser

[!INCLUDE [Use authoring key for endpoint](quickstart-rest-get-intent.md)]

## Get intent programmatically

You can use Java to access the same results you saw in the browser window in the previous step. Be sure to add the Apache libraries to your project.

1. Copy the following code to create a class in a file named `LuisGetRequest.java`:

   [!code-java[Console app code that calls a LUIS endpoint](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/quickstarts/analyze-text/java/call-endpoint.java)]

2. Replace the value of the `YOUR-KEY` variable with your LUIS key.

3. Replace with your file path and compile the java program from a command line: `javac -cp .;<FILE_PATH>\* LuisGetRequest.java`.

4. Replace with your file path and run the application from a command line: `java -cp .;<FILE_PATH>\* LuisGetRequest.java`. It displays the same JSON that you saw earlier in the browser window.
