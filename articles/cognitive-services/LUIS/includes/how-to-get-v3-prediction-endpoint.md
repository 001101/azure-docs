1. In the LUIS portal, in the **Manage** section (top right menu), on the **Keys and endpoints** page (left menu), select the **endpoint** URL at the bottom of the page. 

    This action opens browser tab with the endpoint URL in the address bar.

    The URL has your app ID, key, and slot name. The V3 prediction endpoint URL looks like:

    `https://REGION.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v3.0/apps/APP-ID/slots/SLOT-NAME/predict?subscription-key=YOUR-KEY&<optional-name-value-pairs>&query=UTTERANCE-TEXT`.
