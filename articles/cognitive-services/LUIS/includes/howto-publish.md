In order to receive a LUIS prediction in a chat bot or other client application, you need to publish the app to the endpoint.

1. Select **Publish** in the top-right navigation.

    ![LUIS publishes to endpoint button in top-right menu](../media/howto-publish/publish-button.png)

1. Select the **Production slot**, then select **Done**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![LUIS publishes to endpoint](../media/howto-publish/publish-app-popup.png)

    Publishing is complete when you see the notification confirming success.

1. From the **Notifications** pane, in the top-right navigation, select the **Access your endpoint URLs** link to go to the **Azure Resources** page. The endpoint URLs are listed as the **Example Query** box.
