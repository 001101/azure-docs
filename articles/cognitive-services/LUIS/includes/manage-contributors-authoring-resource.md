If your apps need to be authored by other people, you need to add the associated email addresses in the Azure portal's authoring resource.

If you are the owner or administrator of your Azure subscription, you can add a contributor to the resource. If you are not the owner or administrator of your Azure subscription, your Azure account needs to have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions.
