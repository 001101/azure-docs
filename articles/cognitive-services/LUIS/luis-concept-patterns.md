# Patterns improve prediction accuracy
Patterns are designed to improve accuracy when an utterance has the same words but in a different order. By providing a pattern for the utterance, LUIS can have a high confidence in the prediction. 

## Patterns solve low intent confidence
Consider a Human Resources app that reports on the organizational chart in relation to an employee. Given an employee's name and relationship, LUIS returns the employees involved. Consider an employee, Tom, with a manager name Alice, and a team of subordinates named: Michael, Rebecca, and Carl.

Tom reports to Alice
Michael, Rebecca, and Carl report to Tom

`Who is Tom's subordinate?" GetOrgChart (.30)
'Who is the subordinate of Tom?' (.30)

`Who manages Tom?` (.30)
`Who does Tom manage?` (.30)

If an app has between 10 and 20 utterances with different lengths of sentence, different word order, and even different words (synonyms of subordinate, manage, report, LUIS may return a low confidence score. In order to help LUIS understand the importance of the word order, create a pattern. 

## Patterns solve missed entity detection
A second issue is that LUIS doesn't find the employee name in the utterance, to return in an entity. 

## Prediction scores with and without patterns
Given enough example utterances, LUIS would be able to increase prediction confidence without patterns. Patterns increase the confidence score and find the entity without having to provide as many utterances as without using patterns.  

## Pattern matching
A pattern is matched based on finding the entities inside the pattern first, then validating the rest of the words and word order of the pattern. 

## Pattern syntax
Entities in patterns are surrounded by curly brackets. Patterns can include entities, and entities with roles. Pattern.any is an entity only used in patterns. The syntax for each of these is explained in the following sections.

### Syntax to add an entity to a pattern template
To add an entity into the pattern template, surround the entity name with curly braces, such as `Who does {Employee} manage?`. 

```
Who does {Employee} manage?
```

### Syntax to add an entity and role to a pattern template
An entity role is denoted as `{entity:role}` with the entity name followed by a colon, then the role name. To add an entity with a role into the pattern template, surround the entity role name with curly braces, such as `Book a ticket from {Location.Origin} to {Location.Destination}`. 

```
Book a ticket from {Location.Origin} to {Location.Destination}
```

### Syntax to add a pattern.any to pattern template
The Pattern.any entity allows you to add an entity of varying length to the pattern. As long as the pattern template is followed, the pattern.any can be any length. 

To add a **Pattern.any** entity into the pattern template, surround the Pattern.any entity with the curly braces, such as `How much does {Booktitle} cost and what format is it available in?`.  

```
How much does {Booktitle} cost and what format is it available in?
```

|Book titles in the pattern|
|--|
|How much does **steal this book** cost and what format is it available in?|
|How much does **ask** cost and what format is it available in?|
|How much does **The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time** cost and what format is it available in?| 

In these book title examples, the contextual words of the book title are not confusing to LUIS. LUIS knows where the book title ends because it is in a pattern and marked with a Pattern.any entity.

## Best practices
Do not create a pattern when you first create the app. Give LUIS the opportunity to learn from the provided utterances before adding patterns.
