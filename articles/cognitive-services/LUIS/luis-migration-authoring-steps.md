# Migration Steps

From the Language Understanding (LUIS) portal, migrate all the apps you own to use the Active Directory authoring key.

## Begin the migration process

Before you migrate to the Active Directory authoring experience, you need to have an Azure subscription. If you do not have an Azure subscription, [sign up]().

1. Choose to migrate now or migrate later. You have 9 months to migrate to the new authoring key in Active Directory.

1. [Sign up to Azure]() and create your first subscription if you do not have an Azure subscription. 

1. Choose or create a LUIS authoring resource.
