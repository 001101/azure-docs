# DevOps practices for LUIS

Software engineers want to follow best practices around [source control](luis-concept-devops-sourcecontrol.md), [automated builds](luis-concept-devops-automation.md), [testing](luis-concept-devops-testing.md) and [release management](luis-concept-devops-automation.md#release-management) when developing a Language Understanding Intelligent Services (LUIS) app.

## Source control and branch strategies for LUIS

One of the key factors that the success of DevOps depends upon is [source control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/user-guide/source-control?view=azure-devops). A source control system allows developers to collaborate on code and to track changes. The use of branches allows developers to switch between different versions of the code base, and to work independently from other members of the team. When developers raise a [pull request](https://help.github.com/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) to propose updates from one branch to another, or when changes are merged, this can be the trigger for [automated builds](luis-concept-devops-automation.md) to build and continuously test code.

By following the concepts and guidance described in this document, you can develop a LUIS app and track changes in a source control system by following these software engineering best practices:

- **Source Control**
  - Source code for your LUIS app is in a human-readable format.
  - The model can be built from source in a repeatable fashion.
  - The source code can be managed by a source code repository.
  - Credentials and secrets such as authoring and subscription keys are never stored in source code.

- **Branching and Merging**
  - Developers can work from independent branches.
  - Work in multiple branches concurrently.
  - Rebase and merge from the parent branch.
  - Merge a PR to the parent branch.

- **Versioning**
  - Each component in a large application should be versioned independently hence allowing developers to detect breaking changes or seamless updates just by looking at the version number.

- **Code Reviews**
  - The changes in the PR are presented as human readable source code that can be reviewed before accepting the PR.

## Source Control

To maintain the [App schema definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/app-schema-definition) of a LUIS app in a source code management system, use the [LUDown format (`.lu`)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/file-format/bot-builder-lu-file-format?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)  representation of the app. `.lu` format is preferred to `.json` format because it's human readable, which makes it easier to modify and to review changes in PRs.

### Save a LUIS app using the LUDown format

To save a LUIS app in `.lu` format and place it under source control:

- EITHER: [Export the app version as `.lu`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-manage-versions#other-actions) from the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai/) and add it to your source control repository

- OR: Use a text editor to create a `.lu` file for a LUIS app and add it to your source control repository

> [!TIP]
> If you are working with the JSON export of a LUIS app, you can [convert it to LUDown](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/tree/master/packages/luis#bf-luisconvert) using the [BotBuilder-Tools LUIS CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/LUIS). Use the `--sort` option to ensure that intents and utterances are sorted alphabetically.  
> Note that the **.LU** export capability built into the LUIS portal already sorts the output.

### Build the LUIS app from source

To build the LUIS app from the `.lu` source, you can:

- Use the LUIS portal to [import the `.lu` version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-manage-versions#import-version) of the app from source control, and [train](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-train) and [publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-publish-app) the app.

- Use the [Bot Framework Command Line Interface for LUIS](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/LUIS) at the command line or in a CI/CD workflow to [import](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/blob/master/packages/luis/README.md#bf-luisversionimport) the `.lu` version of the app from source control into a LUIS application, and [train](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/blob/master/packages/luis/README.md#bf-luistrainrun) and [publish](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/blob/master/packages/luis/README.md#bf-luisapplicationpublish) the app.

### Files to maintain under source control

The following types of files for your LUIS application should be maintained under source control:

- `.lu` file for the LUIS application

- [Unit Test definition files](link tbd) (utterances and expected results)

- [Batch test files](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-batch-test#batch-file-format) (utterances and expected results) used for performance testing

### CredentialsÂ and keys are not checked in

Keys and similar confidential values must not be included in files that you check in to your repo where they might be visible to unauthorized personnel. The keys and other values that you should prevent from check in include:

- LUIS Authoring and Prediction keys
- LUIS Authoring and Prediction endpoints
- Azure subscription keys
- Access tokens, such as the token for an Azure [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest) used for automation authentication

#### Strategies for securely managing secrets

Strategies for securely managing secrets include:

- If you're using Git version control, you can store runtime secrets in a local file and prevent check in of the file by adding a pattern to match the filename to a [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file
- In an automation workflow, you can store secrets securely in the parameters configuration offered by that automation technology. For example, if you're using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), you can store secrets securely in [GitHub secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets).

## Branching and merging

Distributed version control systems like Git give flexibility in how team members publish, share, review, and iterate on code changes through Git branches shared with others. Adopt a [Git branching strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance) that is appropriate for your team.

Whichever branching strategy you adopt, a key principle of all of them is that team members can work on the solution within a *feature branch* independently from the work that other team members are doing in other branches.

To support independent working in branches with a LUIS project:

- **Each feature branch must use its own instance of a LUIS app**. Developers work with this app in a feature branch without fear of affecting developers working in other branches.
- **The master branch also has its own LUIS app.** This app receives the updates when work is merged into master from a feature branch. This app represents the current state of development for your project and is the app which could be deployed to build environments such as Production.

### Developers can work from independent branches

Developers can work on updates on a LUIS app independently from other branches by:

1. Creating a feature branch from the main branch (usually called master or develop)

1. [Create a new LUIS app in the LUIS portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-start-new-app) solely to support the work in the feature branch.

1. If you are working on an existing project and the `.lu` source for the solution app already exists in the repo, import the `.lu` file into the LUIS application created.

1. Work on the LUIS app to implement the required changes.

1. Test the updated application - see [Testing for LUIS DevOps](luis-concept-devops-testing.md) for details on testing your application within a development branch.

1. Export the active version of your development LUIS app as `.lu` from the [versions list](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-manage-versions).

1. Check in your updates and invite peer review of your updates. If you're using GitHub, you'll raise a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

1. When the changes are approved, merge the updates into the master branch. At this point, a new [version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-manage-versions) of the LUIS app for the *master* branch should be created, using the updated `.lu` in master. See [Versioning](#versioning) for considerations on setting the version name.

1. When the feature branch is deleted, it is good practice also to delete the LUIS app you created for the feature branch work.

### Developers can work in multiple branches concurrently

If you follow the pattern described above in [Developers can work from independent branches](#developers-can-work-from-independent-branches), then each branch will use a unique LUIS application to support development. This enables a single developer to work on multiple branches concurrently, as long as they switch to the correct LUIS app for the branch they are currently working on.

It is highly recommended that you use the same name for both the feature branch and for the LUIS app that you create for the feature branch work, so as to reduce the likelihood of accidentally working on the wrong app.

### Multiple developers can work on the same branch concurrently

You can support multiple developers working on the same feature branch at the same time:

- Developers check out the same feature branch and push and pull changes submitted by themselves and other developers while work proceeds, as normal.

- If you follow the pattern described above in [Developers can work from independent branches](#developers-can-work-from-independent-branches), then each branch will use a unique LUIS application to support development. That app will be created by the first member of the development team who commences work in the feature branch.

- [Add team members as contributors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-collaborate) to the LUIS app.

- When the feature branch work is complete, export the active version of the development LUIS app as `.lu` from the [versions list](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-manage-versions), save the updated `.lu` file in the repo, and check in and PR the changes.

### Rebase and merge from master

If you are working on changes to a LUIS app in a feature branch and some other developers on your team have merged updates to the LUIS app to the master branch since you created your feature branch, you can [rebase and merge to master](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) in the same way as any other code asset. Since the LUIS app in LUDown format is human readable, it supports merging using standard Merge tools.

Follow these tips if you are rebasing your LUIS app in a feature branch:

- Make sure that any changes you have already made in the portal and not yet exported aren't lost. Re-export your development app from the LUIS portal before you commence your rebase and merge.

- During the merge, use standard tools to resolve any merge conflicts.

- Don't forget to reimport the app and retrain after rebase and merge is complete.

### Merge PRs

After your PR is approved, you can merge your changes to your master branch. No special considerations apply to the LUDown source for a LUIS app: it is human readable and so supports merging using standard Merge tools. Any merge conflicts may be resolved in the same way as with other source files.

After your PR has been merged, it is recommended to:

- Delete the branch

- Delete the LUIS app for the branch.

Just as with code assets, unit tests should accompany LUIS app updates to test the validity of the updates. You should employ continuous integration workflows to test:

- Updates in a PR before the PR is merged
- The master branch LUIS app after a PR has been approved and the changes have been merged into master.

See [Testing for DevOps for LUIS](luis-concept-devops-testing.md) for more details on testing for LUIS DevOps. See [Automation workflows for LUIS DevOps](luis-concept-devops-automation.md) for more details on implementing workflows.

## Versioning

An application consists of multiple components, that might include things such as a bot running in [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0), a [QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) service, an [Azure Speech service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/overview), and more. To achieve the goal of loosely coupled applications, each component of an application should be versioned independently hence allowing developers to detect breaking changes or seamless updates just by looking at the version number.

The LUIS app for the master branch should have a versioning scheme applied. When you merge updates to the LUDown representation of a LUIS app into the master branch, you will then import that updated source into a new version in the LUIS app that you are maintaining for the master branch.

It is recommended that you use a numeric versioning scheme for the LUIS app version, e.g.

`major.minor[.build[.revision]]`

Each update the version number is incremented at the last digit.

The major / minor version can be used to indicate the scope of the changes to the LUIS app functionality, e.g.

* Major Version: A significant change, such as support for a new [Intent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-intent) or [Entity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-entity-types)
* Minor Version: A backwards-compatible minor change, such as after significant new training
* Build / Revision: No functionality change, just a different build.

Once you have determined the version number for the latest revision of your LUIS app, you need to test and release it. It is highly recommended that all of these functions are performed automatically by a continuous integration (CI) workflow. This workflow should also test your new version to ensure that them quality assurance bar is being met, and should release and deploy your app for use by other components in your application and to different build environments, such as Quality Assurance or Production.

See:
- [Automation workflows](luis-concept-devops-automation.md) for details on how to implement a CI workflow to test and release a LUIS app.
- [Release Management](luis-concept-devops-automation.md#release-management) for information on how to to deploy your LUIS app.

### Versioning the 'feature branch' LUIS app

When you are working with a LUIS app that you have created to support work in a feature branch, the app is a transient thing that should be deleted after the branch has been merged to master. There is no particular versioning scheme you need to apply to this app.

## Code reviews

A LUIS app in LUDown format is human readable which supports the communication of changes in a PR suitable for review. Unit test files are also written in LUDown format and also easily reviewable in a PR.
