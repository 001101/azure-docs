# Authoring and query prediction endpoint keys in LUIS


Please [migrated]() any apps, which use the older non-Active Directory authentication, before continuing.

LUIS uses two Azure resources, which each have access keys: 

* [Authoring](#programmatic-key) to create intents, entities, and label utterances, train, and publish. When you are ready to publish your LUIS app, you need to [create the query prediction endpoint](luis-how-to-azure-subscription.md) resource if you don't have one, then [assign it](luis-how-to-azure-subscription.md) to your LUIS app.
* [Runtime](#runtime-key-for-query-predictions-of-user-utterances). Client-applications such as a chat bot need access to the runtime's **query prediction endpoint** through this key. 

|Key|Purpose|Cognitive service `kind`|Cognitive service `type`|
|--|--|--|--|
|[Authoring key](#programmatic-key)|Authoring, training, publishing, testing.|`LUIS.Authoring`|`Cognitive Services`|
|[Runtime key](#runtime-key-for-query-predictions-of-user-utterances)| Querying with a user utterance to determine intents and entities.|`LUIS`|`Cognitive Services`|

It is important to author LUIS apps in [regions](luis-reference-regions.md#publishing-regions) where you want to publish and query.

<a name="programmatic-key" ></a>

## Authoring key

An authoring key, also known as a starter key, is created automatically when you create a LUIS account and it is free. You have one authoring key across all your LUIS apps for each authoring [region](luis-reference-regions.md). The authoring key is provided to author your LUIS app or to test endpoint queries. 

To find the authoring Key, sign in to [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md#luis-website) and click on the account name in the upper-right navigation bar to open **Account Settings**.

When you want to make **production endpoint queries**, create the Azure [LUIS subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-services/). 

> [!CAUTION]
> For convenience, many of the samples use the Authoring key since it provides a few endpoint calls in its [quota](luis-boundaries.md#key-limits).  

<a href="endpoint-key"></a>

## Runtime key for query predictions of user utterances

When you need **production endpoint queries**, create an Language Understanding (LUIS) runtime resource then assign it to the LUIS app. 

[!INCLUDE [Azure runtime resource creation for Language Understanding and Cognitive Service resources](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-azure-resource-instructions.md)]

When the Azure runtime resource creation process is finished, [assign the key](luis-how-to-azure-subscription.md) to the app. 

* The runtime (query prediction endpoint) key allows a quota of endpoint hits based on the usage plan you specified when creating the runtime key. See [Cognitive Services Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-services/?v=17.23h) for pricing information.

* The runtime key can be used for all your LUIS apps or for specific LUIS apps. 

* Do not use the runtime key for authoring LUIS apps.

## Use runtime key in query
The LUIS endpoint accepts two styles of query, both use the runtime key, but in different places.

The endpoint used to access the runtime uses a subdomain that is unique to your resource's region, denoted with `{region}` in the following table. 


|Verb|Example url and key location|
|--|--|
|[GET](https://{region}.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5819c76f40a6350ce09de1ac/operations/5819c77140a63516d81aee78)|`https://{region}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/df67dcdb-c37d-46af-88e1-8b97951ca1c2?runtime-key=your-endpoint-key-here&verbose=true&timezoneOffset=0&q=turn%20on%20the%20lights`<br><br>query string value for `runtime-key`<br><br>Change your endpoint query value for the `runtime-key` from the authoring (starter) key, to the new endpoint key in order to use the LUIS endpoint key quota rate. If you create the key, and assign the key but do not change the endpoint query value for `runtime-key`, you are not using your endpoint key quota.|
|[POST](https://{region}.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5819c76f40a6350ce09de1ac/operations/5819c77140a63516d81aee79)| `https://{region}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/df67dcdb-c37d-46af-88e1-8b97951ca1c2`<br><br> header value for `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`<br>If you create the runtime key, and assign the runtime key but do not change the endpoint query value for `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`, you are not using your runtime key.|

The app ID used in the previous URLs, `df67dcdb-c37d-46af-88e1-8b97951ca1c2`, is the public IoT app used for the [interactive demonstration](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/). 

## API usage of Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key

The LUIS APIs use the header, `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`. The header name does not change but the value of the key does. If you are accessing runtime APIs to get a query prediction of a user utterance, use the runtime time. All other APIs use the authoring key.

The API will return a `401` error (access denied) if you using the incorrect key.

## Key limits
See [Key Limits](luis-boundaries.md#key-limits) and [Azure regions](luis-reference-regions.md). The authoring key is free and used for authoring. The LUIS endpoint key has a free tier but must be created by you and associated with your LUIS app on the **Publish** page. It can't be used for authoring, but only endpoint queries.

Publishing regions are different from authoring regions. Make sure you create an app in the authoring region corresponding to the publishing region you want.

## Key limit errors
If you exceed your per second quota, you receive an HTTP 429 error. If you exceed your per month quota, you receive an HTTP 403 error. Fix these errors by getting a LUIS [endpoint](#endpoint-key) key, [assigning](luis-how-to-azure-subscription.md) the key to the app on the **Publish** page of the [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md#luis-website) website.

## Assignment of the runtime key

You can [assign](luis-how-to-azure-subscription.md) the endpoint key in the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai) or via the corresponding APIs. 

## Collaborating with other authors

Please [migrated]() any apps, which use the older non-Active Directory authentication before continuing.

After a one-time migration of authoring to Active Directory, LUIS apps use Active Directory authentication with Active Directory roles to provide access for app authoring. This allows multiple people to author a single app.

### Managing multiple authors

All users that author a LUIS app, need to be added to ROLENAME role on the resource. This is [completed]() from the Azure portal.

### Moving or changing ownership of your LUIS app

An app is defined by its Azure resource, which is determined by the app's subscription. 

You can move your LUIS app. Use the following documentation resources to learn more:

* [Move resource to new resource group or subscription](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources.md)
* [Move resource within same subscription or across subscriptions](../azure-resource-manager/move-limitations/app-service-move-limitations.md)
* [Transfer ownership](../billing/billing-subscription-transfer.md) of your subscription 

### Collaborator roles vs entity roles

[Entity roles](luis-concept-roles.md) apply to the data model of the LUIS app. Collaborator roles apply to levels of authoring access. 

## Authoring and endpoint user access

Authoring access is available for owners and collaborators. 

Please [migrated]() any apps, which use the older non-Active Directory authentication before continuing.

### Private and public app access

For a private app, endpoint access is available for owners and collaborators. For a public app, endpoint access is available to everyone that has their own Azure [Cognitive Service](../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) or [LUIS](luis-how-to-azure-subscription.md#create-prediction-endpoint-runtime-resource-in-the-azure-portal) resource, and has the public app's ID. 

### Access to authoring
Access to the app from the [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md#luis-website) website or the [authoring APIs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2092087) is controlled by the Active Directory for the Azure resource. 

The owner and all collaborators have access to author the app. 

|Authoring access includes|Notes|
|--|--|
|Add or remove endpoint keys||
|Exporting version||
|Export endpoint logs||
|Importing version||
|Make app public|When an app is public, anyone with an authoring or endpoint key can query the app.|
|Modify model|
|Publish|
|Review endpoint utterances for [active learning](luis-how-to-review-endpoint-utterances.md)|
|Train|

### Access to endpoint

Access to query the endpoint is controlled by a setting on the **Application Information** page in the **Manage** section. 

![Set app to public](./media/luis-concept-security/set-application-as-public.png)

|[Private endpoint](#private-app-endpoint-security)|[Public endpoint](#public-app-endpoint-access)|
|:--|:--|
|Available to owner and collaborators|Available to owner, collaborators, and anyone else that knows app ID|

#### Private app endpoint security

A private app's endpoint is only available to the following:

|Key and user|Explanation|
|--|--|
|Owner's authoring key| Up to 1000 endpoint hits|
|Collaborators' authoring keys| Up to 1000 endpoint hits|
|Any key assigned to LUIS by an author or collaborator|Based on key usage tier|

##### Microsoft user accounts

Authors and collaborators can assign keys to a private LUIS app. The Microsoft user account that creates the LUIS key in the Azure portal needs to be either the app owner or an app collaborator. You can't assign a key to a private app from another Azure account.

See [Azure Active Directory tenant user](luis-how-to-collaborate.md#azure-active-directory-tenant-user) to learn more about Active Directory user accounts. 

#### Public app endpoint access

Once an app is configured as public, _any_ valid LUIS authoring key or LUIS endpoint key can query your app, as long as the key has not used the entire endpoint quota.

A user who is not an owner or collaborator, can only access a public app if given the app ID. LUIS doesn't have a public _market_ or other way to search for a public app.  

A public app is published in all regions so that a user with a region-based LUIS resource key can access the app in whichever region is associated with the resource key.

### Microsoft user accounts

Authors and collaborators can add keys to LUIS on the Publish page. The Microsoft user account that creates the LUIS key in the Azure portal needs to be either the app owner or an app collaborator. 

See [Azure Active Directory tenant user](luis-how-to-collaborate.md#azure-active-directory-tenant-user) to learn more about Active Directory user accounts. 

### Securing the endpoint 

You can control who can see your LUIS endpoint key by calling it in a server-to-server environment. If you are using LUIS from a bot, the connection between the bot and LUIS is already secure. If you are calling the LUIS endpoint directly, you should create a server-side API (such as an Azure [function](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/)) with controlled access (such as [AAD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/)). When the server-side API is called and authentication and authorization are verified, pass the call on to LUIS. While this strategy doesn’t prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, it obfuscates your endpoint from your users, allows you to track access, and allows you to add endpoint response logging (such as [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/)).
