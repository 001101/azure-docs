If any service provider fails to comply with any terms or conditions at any time, 21Vianet has the right to remove the service provider’s products from the Azure China Market and the Azure portal (hereinafter “Azure Market” or “the Market”).

## <a name="-"></a>Article 4: Product category definitions

### <a name="vm"></a>Virtual machine (VM) image
A virtual machine image that has been preconfigured with an operating system and one or more apps installed. The VM image may contain one or more VM images bundled with an Azure Resource Manager template.

VM images (hereinafter “images”) provide the information that is needed to create and configure virtual machines within Azure VM services. An image is composed of an operating system virtual hard disk (VHD) and zero or multiple data disk VHDs. Customers can use a single image to configure any number of VMs.

### <a name=""></a>Custom service (solutions)
A set of Azure-based software or hardware and software solutions that address a certain type of IT issue that is prevalent in a particular industry. It is provided to business analysts, development, operations and maintenance personnel, or IT specialists, for reference and consultation purposes. Users can contact the service provider to request a custom service that is tailored to their individual scenario and requirements.

### <a name="arm-"></a>Resource Manager templates
Azure Resource Manager templates can refer to several different products, including products published by other service providers, and enable Azure customers to coordinate and configure one or multiple products on a one-time basis.

“Resource Manager templates” can refer to one or multiple products and include the data structure for the metadata (including the relevant listing information) for the products. Market services use Resource Manager templates to display and enable customers to configure certain types of products. Service providers can publish Resource Manager templates that refer to multiple products (including products published by other service providers) in the Market.

## <a name="-"></a>Article 5: Pricing models
The following table lists the pricing models that are currently supported by the Azure Market. A product can include a variety of SKUs that use different pricing models.

| **Pricing model** | **Explanation** | **Applicability** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Free SKUs. Customers are not required to pay any fees to Azure Market to use the product. The price of a free SKU cannot be set to any amount other than zero.| Virtual machine image<br/><br/>Custom service<br/>Resource Manager templates |

The Market does not currently provide a function that allows a service provider to change the usage fees for any product that has already been published. Until this function has been added to the Market, if the service provider wants to change the usage fees for a particular product, the service provider should take the product listing down in accordance with the requirements of this document and the Azure Market Service Agreement, and then publish a new product that includes the new usage fees.

## <a name="-"></a>Article 6: Suspending and removing product listings

1. 21Vianet reserves the right to suspend the provision of any product or remove any product from the Azure Market for any reason. 21Vianet may remove a product listing for reasons that include, but are not limited to:
   - The product has not been ordered by any customers for six months or longer.
   - The product has consistently received poor feedback from customers.
   - The product has consistently been subject to a large amount of support requests.
   - The service provider has not complied with the terms and conditions of the Azure Market Service Agreement, or with the provisions of the Market Publication Technical Guidelines or this document.
   - The product includes content that is untrue, illegal, inaccurate, or incomplete or that is obscene, pornographic, violent, frightening, immoral, deceptive, slanderous or threatening, or that includes gambling, harassment, or murder.
   - The product includes malicious computer code or viruses, or might disrupt or attempt to disrupt the normal operation of the Market platform, other service providers’ images, or any functions thereof.
   - The product might infringe the legitimate rights of another party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights.
   - The product might violate any applicable laws or regulations.
2. The service provider may take down a product listing after giving 30 days’ notice. After a particular product listing has been taken down, the service provider must continue to provide services to the existing customers for a period of 90 days or until the expiration date that was acknowledged by the customer at the time of purchase (whichever is longer). After any other category of product listing is taken down, the delisting of the product applies only to potential customers, and existing customers may continue to use the product within the same scope as before the delisting. 21Vianet will remove the product listing within 30 days of receiving the takedown notice, and it will no longer offer the product to new subscribers.
