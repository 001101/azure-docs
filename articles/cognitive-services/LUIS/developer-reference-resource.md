# Developer resources for Language Understanding

Developers have both REST APIs and SDKs for Language Understanding. 

## Azure resource management

Use the Azure Cognitive Services Management layer to create, edit, list, and delete the Language Understanding or Cognitive Service resource:

* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/cognitiveservices?view=azure-cli-latest#az_cognitiveservices_list)
* [Azure RM PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.cognitiveservices/?view=azurermps-4.4.1#cognitive_services)

## Language Understanding authoring and prediction endpoint requests

The Language Understanding service is accessed from an Azure resource you need to create. There are two resources: authoring and prediction endpoint resources. Both of these resources allow you to control your LUIS resources.
