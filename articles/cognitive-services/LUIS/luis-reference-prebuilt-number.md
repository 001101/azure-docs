# Number entity

There are many ways in which numeric values are used to quantify, express, and describe pieces of information. This article covers only some of the possible examples. LUIS interprets the variations in user utterances and returns consistent numeric values. 

| Utterance        | Entity   | Resolution |
| ------------- |:----------------:| --------------:|
| ```one thousand times```  | ```"one thousand"``` |   ```"1000"```      | 
| ```1,000 people```        | ```"1,000"```    |   ```"1000"```      |
| ```1/2 cup```         | ```"1 / 2"```    |    ```"0.5"```      |
|  ```one half the amount```     | ```"one half"```     |    ```"0.5"```      |
| ```one hundred fifty orders``` | ```"one hundred fifty"``` | ```"150"``` |
| ```one hundred and fifty books``` | ```"one hundred and fifty"``` | ```"150"```|
| ```a grade of one point five```| ```"one point five"``` |  ```"1.5"``` |
| ```buy two dozen eggs```    | ```"two dozen"``` | ```"24"``` |


LUIS includes the recognized value of a **`builtin.number`** entity in the `resolution` field of the JSON response it returns.


The following example shows a JSON response from LUIS, that includes the resolution of the value 24, for the utterance "two dozen".

```JSON
{
  "query": "order two dozen eggs",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "OrderFood",
    "score": 0.105443209
  },
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "None",
      "score": 0.105443209
    },
    {
      "intent": "OrderFood",
      "score": 0.9468431361
    },
    {
      "intent": "Help",
      "score": 0.000399122015
    },
  ],
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity": "two dozen",
      "type": "builtin.number",
      "startIndex": 6,
      "endIndex": 14,
      "resolution": {
        "value": "24"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
