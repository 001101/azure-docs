# Publish your trained app
When you finish building and testing your LUIS app, publish it. After the app is published, the Publish page shows all associated HTTP [endpoints](luis-glossary.md#endpoint). These endpoints, per [region](luis-reference-regions.md) and per [key](Manage-Keys.md), are then integrated into any client, chat bot, or backend application. 

You can always [test](train-test.md) your app before publishing it. 

## Production and staging slots
You can publish your app to the **Staging slot** or the **Production Slot**. By using two publishing slots, this allows you to have two different versions with published endpoints or the same version on two different endpoints. 

<!-- TBD: what is the technical difference? log files, endpoint quota? -->

## Configure settings then publish

### Set Timezone offset
Part of the slot choice is the time zone selection. This timezone setting allows LUIS to [alter](luis-concept-data-alteration.md#change-time-zone-of-prebuilt-datetimev2-entity) any prebuilt datetimeV2 time values during prediction so that the returned entity data is correct according to the selected time zone. 

### Include all predicted intent scores
The **Include all predicted intent scores** checkbox allows the endpoint query response to include the prediction score for each intent. 

This setting allows your chat bot or LUIS-calling application to make a programmatic decision based on the scores of the returned intents. Generally the top two intents are the most interesting. If the top score is the None intent, your chat bot can choose to ask a follow-up question that makes a definitive choice between the None intent and the other high-scoring intent. 

The intents and their scores are also included the endpoint logs. You can [export](create-new-app.md#export-app) those logs and analyze the scores. 

```
{
  "query": "book a flight to Cairo",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "None",
    "score": 0.5223427
  },
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "None",
      "score": 0.5223427
    },
    {
      "intent": "BookFlight",
      "score": 0.372391433
    }
  ],
  "entities": []
}
```

### Enable Bing spell checker 
In the **Endpoint url settings**, the **Enable Bing spell checker** checkbox allows LUIS to correct misspelled words before prediction. This requires you to create a **[Bing Spell Check key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=spellcheck-api)**. Once the key is created, two querystring parameters are added to the endpoint URL on the publish page. 

If you are constructing your own URLs for your LUIS-calling application, make sure the **spellCheck=true** querystring parameter and the **bing-spell-check-subscription-key={YOUR_BING_KEY_HERE}**. Replace the `{YOUR_BING_KEY_HERE}` with your Bing spell checker key.

```JSON
{
  "query": "Book a flite to London?",
  "alteredQuery": "Book a flight to London?",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "BookFlight",
    "score": 0.780123
  },
  "entities": []
}
```

### Enable sentiment analysis
In the **External services settings**, the **Enable Sentiment Analysis** checkbox allows LUIS to integrate with [Text Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) to provide sentiment and key phrase analysis. You do not have to provide a Text Analytics key and there is no billing charge for this service to your Azure account. Once you check this setting, it is persistent. 

Sentiment data is a score between 1 and 0 indicating the positive (closer to 1) or negative (closer to 0) sentiment of the data.

<!-- TBD: verify JSON-->
```JSON
{
    "score": 0.9999237060546875,
    "id": "1"
}
```

<!-- TBD: verify JSON-->
```JSON
"keyPhrases": [
    "places",
    "beautiful views",
    "favorite trail"
]
```

### Enable speech priming 
In the **External services settings**, the **Enable Speech Priming** checkbox allows you to have a single endpoint to get a spoken utterance from a chat bot or LUIS-calling application and receive a LUIS prediction response. The Speech priming uses the Cognitive service [Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/speech/). In order to use this option, you need the LUIS subscription endpoint key, the LUIS app ID, and the LUIS endpoint URL. These are needed to configure speech priming.

Once this feature is enabled, publish your app. When you publish your LUIS app, your app model is sent to your own Speech service to prime the Speech service. Your model information is **not** used outside of your own services. 

When your app is deleted or the Speech service is deleted, the model data is removed. 

## Publish your trained app to an HTTP endpoint

Open your app by clicking its name on the **My Apps** page, and then click **Publish** in the top panel. 

![Publish page-](./media/luis-how-to-publish-app/publish-to-production.png)
 
When your app is successfully published, a green success notification appears at the top of the browser.

## Assign key

If you want to use a key other than the free Starter_Key shown, click the **Add Key** button. This action opens a dialog that allows you to select an existing endpoint key to assign to the app. For more information on how to create and add endpoint keys to your LUIS app, see [Manage your keys](Manage-Keys.md).

To see endpoints and keys associated with other regions, use the radio buttons to switch regions. Each row in the **Resources and Keys** table lists Azure resources associated with your account and the endpoint keys associated with that resource.

## Endpoint URL construction
The endpoint URL corresponds to the Azure region associated with the endpoint key.

This table conveniently reflects your publishing configuration in the URL endpoint with route choices and query string values. If you are constructing your endpoint URLs for your LUIS-calling application, make sure these same routes and query string values are set for the endpoint used -- if you want them set.

The URL route is constructed with the region, and the app ID. If you are publishing in other regions or with other apps, the endpoint URL can be constructed by changing the region and app ID values. 

### Optional query string parameters
The following query string parameters can be used with the endpoint URL:

<!-- TBD: what about speech priming? -->

|Query string|Type|Example value|Purpose|
|--|--|--|--|
|verbose|boolean|true|Include [all intent scores](#include-all-predicted-intent-scores) for utterance|
|sentiment|boolean|true|Include [sentiment](#enable-sentiment-analysis) score for utterance|
|timezoneOffset|number (unit is minutes)|60|Set [timezone offset](#set-timezone) for [datetimeV2 prebuilt entities](#builtindatetimev2)|
|spellCheck|boolean|true|[correct spelling](#enable-bing-spell-checker) of utterance -- used in conjunction with bing-spell-check-subscription-key query string parameter|
|bing-spell-check-subscription-key|subscription ID||used in conjunction with spellCheck query string parameter|
|staging|boolean|false|select staging or production endpoint|
|log|boolean|true|add query and results to log|


## Test your published endpoint in a browser
Test your published endpoint by selecting the URL in the **Endpoint** column. The default browser opens with the generated URL. Set the URL parameter "&q" to your test query. For example, append `&q=Book me a flight to Boston on May 4` to your URL, and then press Enter. The browser displays the JSON response of your HTTP endpoint.
