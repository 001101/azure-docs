# Publish your trained app
When you finish building and testing your LUIS app, you publish it on Azure. After the app is published, the Publish page shows all associated HTTP [endpoints](luis-glossary.md#endpoint). These endpoints, per [region](luis-reference-regions.md) and per [key](Manage-Keys.md), are then integrated into any client, chat bot, or backend application. 

You can optionally [test](train-test.md) your app before publishing it. 

## Product and staging slot
You can publish your app to the **Staging slow** or the **Production Slot**. Part of the slot choice is the time zone selection. This allows LUIS to [alter](luis-concept-data-alteration.md#change-time-zone-of-prebuilt-datetimev2-entity) any prebuilt datetimeV2 time values during prediction so that the returned entity data is correct according to the selected time zone. 

## Include all predicted intent scores
In the **Endpoint url settings**, the **Include all predicted intent scores** checkbox allows the endpoint query response to include the prediction score for each utterance for each intent. This allows your chat bot or LUIS-calling application to make a programming decision based on the scores of the returned intents. Generally the top two intents are the most interesting. The intents and their scores are also included the endpoint logs. You can [export](create-new-app.md#export-app) those logs and analyze the scores. 

```
{
  "query": "book a flight to Cairo",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "None",
    "score": 0.5223427
  },
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "None",
      "score": 0.5223427
    },
    {
      "intent": "BookFlight",
      "score": 0.372391433
    }
  ],
  "entities": []
}
```

The checkbox is useful if you are copying the endpoint URLs from the publish page. If you are constructing your own URLs for your LUIS-calling application, make sure the **verbose=true** parameter is added to the endpoint URL querystring. 

## Enable Bing spell checker 
In the **Endpoint url settings**, the **Enable Bing spell checker** checkbox allows LUIS to correct misspelled words before prediction. This requires you to create a **[Bing Spell Check key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=spellcheck-api)**. Once the key is created, two querystring parameters are added to the endpoint URL on the publish page. 

If you are constructing your own URLs for your LUIS-calling application, make sure the **spellCheck=true** querystring parameter and the **bing-spell-check-subscription-key={YOUR_BING_KEY_HERE}**. Replace the `{YOUR_BING_KEY_HERE}` with your Bing spell checker key.

```JSON
{
  "query": "Book a flite to London?",
  "alteredQuery": "Book a flight to London?",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "BookFlight",
    "score": 0.780123
  },
  "entities": []
}
```

## Enable sentiment analysis
In the **External services settings**, the **Enable Sentiment Analysis** checkbox allows LUIS to integrate with [Text Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) to provide sentiment and key phrase analysis. You do not have to provide a Text Analytics key and there is no billing charge for this service to your Azure account. Once you check this setting, it is persistent. 

Sentiment data is a score between 1 and 0 indicating the positive (closer to 1) or negative (closer to 0) sentiment of the data.

<!-- TBD: verify JSON-->
```JSON
{
    "score": 0.9999237060546875,
    "id": "1"
}
```

<!-- TBD: verify JSON-->
```JSON
"keyPhrases": [
    "places",
    "beautiful views",
    "favorite trail"
]
```

## Enable speech priming 
In the **External services settings**, the **Enable Speech Priming** checkbox allows you to have a single endpoint to get a spoken utterance from a chat bot or LUIS-calling application and receive a LUIS prediction response. The Speech priming uses the Cognitive service [Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/speech/). In order to use this option, you need the LUIS subscription endpoint key, the LUIS app ID, and the LUIS endpoint URL. These are needed to configure speech priming. 

Once this feature is enabled, when you publish your LUIS app, your own Speech service is sent your app model to prime the Speech service. 

When your app is deleted or the Speech service is deleted, the model data is removed. 

## Publish your trained app to an HTTP endpoint

1. Open your app by clicking its name on the **My Apps** page, and then click **Publish** in the top panel. The following image shows the **Publish app** page before you publish your app.

    ![Publish page-](./media/luis-how-to-publish-app/luis-first-publish.png)
 
    When you publish an app, this page looks like the following image: 
 
    ![Publish page](./media/luis-how-to-publish-app/luis-republish.png)

2. The first time you publish, the **Publish app** page shows your starter key. If you want to use a key other than the key shown, click the **Add Key** button. This action opens a dialog that allows you to select an existing endpoint key to assign to the app. For more information on how to create and add endpoint keys to your LUIS app, see [Manage your keys](Manage-Keys.md).

3. Choose whether to publish to **Production** or to **Staging** by selecting from the drop-down menu under **Select slot**. 

4. If you want to enable Bing Spell Check, click the **Enable Bing Spell Checker** check box.

    ![Bing Spell Checker](./media/luis-how-to-publish-app/luis-enable-bing-spell-checker.png)

    This checkbox changes your endpoint URL to include the two name/value pairs associated with the Bing Spell Checker: **spellCheck=true** and **bing-spell-check-subscription-key={YOUR_BING_KEY_HERE}**. If you call the LUIS endpoint from a bot or other application, you need to change the endpoint URL there as well.

    |Endpoint Url with Bing Spell Check enabled|
    |--|
    |https://{region}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/{appID}?subscription-key={LUISKey}&verbose=true&timezoneOffset=0&q={query}**&spellCheck=true&bing-spell-check-subscription-key={YOUR_BING_KEY_HERE}**|

5. If you want the JSON response of your published app to include all intents defined in your app and their prediction scores, click **Include all predicted intent scores** checkbox to append a `verbose=true` parameter to the end-point URL. Otherwise, it includes only the top scoring intent.

    ![Verbose Mode](./media/luis-how-to-publish-app/luis-verbose.png)

6. Select the Production slot and the **Publish** button. When the publish succeeds, use the displayed endpoint URL to access your LUIS app. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >If the **Publish** button is disabled, then either your app does not have an assigned endpoint key, or you have not trained your app yet.

    ![Endpoint URL displayed in Publish page](./media/luis-how-to-publish-app/luis-publish-url.png)

The endpoint URL corresponds to the Azure region associated with the endpoint key. To see endpoints and keys associated with other regions, use the radio buttons to switch regions. Each row in the **Resources and Keys** table lists Azure resources associated with your account and the endpoint keys associated with that resource.


## Test your published endpoint in a browser
You can test your published endpoint in a browser using the generated URL. To open this URL in your browser, set the URL parameter "&q" to your test query. For example, append `&q=Book me a flight to Boston on May 4` to your URL, and then press Enter. The browser displays the JSON response of your HTTP endpoint.
