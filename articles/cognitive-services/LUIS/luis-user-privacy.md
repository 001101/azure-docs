# Export and delete your customer data in Language Understanding (LUIS) in Cognitive Services

Delete customer data to ensure privacy and compliance. 

## Summary of customer data request featuresâ€‹
Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) preserves customer content to operate the service, but the LUIS user has full control over viewing, exporting, and deleting their data. This can be done through the LUIS web [portal](luis-reference-regions.md) or the [LUIS Programmatic APIs](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c2f).

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](../../../includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

Customer content is stored encrypted in Microsoft regional Azure storage and includes:

- User account content collected at registration
- Training data required to build the models (i.e. intent & entities)
- User queries logged at runtime to help improve the user models
  - Users can turn off query logging by appending `&log=false` to the request, details [here](troubleshooting.md#how-can-i-disable-the-logging-of-utterances)

## Deleting customer data
LUIS users have full control to delete any user content, either through the LUIS web portal or the LUIS Programmatic APIs. The following table displays links assisting with both:

| | **User Account** | **Application** | **Utterance(s)** | **End-user queries** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Portal** | [Link](luis-how-to-account-settings.md) | [Link](luis-how-to-start-new-app.md#delete-app) | [Link](luis-how-to-start-new-app.md#delete-app) | [Link](luis-how-to-start-new-app.md#delete-app) |
| **APIs** | [Link](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c4c) | [Link](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c39) | [Link](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c0b) | [Link](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/58b6f32139e2bb139ce823c9) |


## Exporting customer data
LUIS users have full control to view the data on the portal, however it must be exported through the LUIS Programmatic APIs. The following table displays links assisting with data exports via the LUIS Programmatic APIs:

| | **User Account** | **Application** | **Utterance(s)** | **End-user queries** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **APIs** | [Link](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c48) | [Link](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c40) | [Link](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c0a) | [Link](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c36) |

## Active learning data

To enable [active learning](luis-how-to-review-endoint-utt.md#enable-active-learning), users' logged utterances, received at the published LUIS endpoints, are stored in one or more of the following Azure geographies:

* [Europe](#europe)
* [Australia](#australia)
* [United States](#united-states)

### Europe

The [eu.luis.ai](https://eu.luis.ai) portal and Europe authoring APIs are hosted in Azure's Europe geography. The eu.luis.ai portal and Europe authoring APIs support deployment of endpoints to the following Azure geographies:

* Europe
* France
* United Kingdom
* Germany

When deploying to these Azure geographies, the utterances received by the endpoint from end users of your app will be stored in Azure's Europe geography for active learning. You can disable active learning, see [Disable active learning](luis-how-to-review-endoint-utt.md#disable-active-learning). To manage stored utterances, see [Delete utterance](luis-how-to-review-endoint-utt.md#delete-utterance). 

### Australia

The [au.luis.ai](https://au.luis.ai) portal and Australia authoring APIs are hosted in Azure's Australia geography. The au.luis.ai portal and Australia authoring APIs support deployment of endpoints to the following Azure geographies:

* Australia

When deploying to these Azure geographies, the utterances received by the endpoint from end users of your app will be stored in Azure's Australia geography for active learning. You can disable active learning, see [Disable active learning](luis-how-to-review-endoint-utt.md#disable-active-learning). To manage stored utterances, see [Delete utterance](luis-how-to-review-endoint-utt.md#delete-utterance). 

### United States

The [luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai) portal and United States authoring APIs are hosted in Azure's United States geography. The luis.ai portal and United States authoring APIs support deployment of endpoints to the following Azure geographies:

* Azure geographies not supported in Europe or Australia

When deploying to these Azure geographies, the utterances received by the endpoint from end users of your app will be stored in Azure's United States geography for active learning. You can disable active learning, see [Disable active learning](luis-how-to-review-endoint-utt.md#disable-active-learning). To manage stored utterances, see [Delete utterance](luis-how-to-review-endoint-utt.md#delete-utterance).
