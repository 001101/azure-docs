For this article, you need a free [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md#luis-website) account to author your LUIS application.

## Before you begin
If you don't have the Human Resources app from the [sentiment](luis-quickstart-intent-and-sentiment-analysis.md) tutorial, import the app from [LUIS-Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/LUIS-Samples/blob/master/documentation-samples/quickstarts/custom-domain-sentiment-HumanResources.json) Github repository. If you use this tutorial from this imported app, you will also need to train, publish, then add the [utterances](https://github.com/Microsoft/LUIS-Samples/blob/master/documentation-samples/quickstarts/endpoint-utterances-Human-Resources.json) to the endpoint with a [script](https://github.com/Microsoft/LUIS-Samples/blob/master/examples/demo-upload-endpoint-utterances/endpoint.js) or from the endpoint in a browser. 

If you want to keep the original Human Resources app, clone the version on the [Settings](luis-how-to-manage-versions.md#clone-a-version) page, and name it `review`. Cloning is a great way to play with various LUIS features without affecting the original version. 

## Purpose of reviewing endpoint utterances
LUIS chose the utterances in the review list. This list is specific to the app and is meant to improve the app's prediction accuracy. This list should be reviewed on a periodic basis to improve predictions. 

The utterances submitted to the app over time, as you progressed through the tutorials, would have utterances that may have incorrect predictions based on the most recent tutorial intents and entities. If you imported the app and used the script to add the utterances, the review utterances would be different because the app didn't go through the various stages of tutorials. 

If you have all the versions of the app, through the tutorials, you may be surprised to see that the **Review endpoint utterances** list doesn't change, based on the version. There is a single pool of utterances to review, regardless of which version the utterance you are actively editing or which version of the app was published at the endpoint. 

## Remove the prebuilt entities
If LUIS doesn't predict custom entities, prebuilt entities will be labeled. Since prebuilt entities can't be removed individually, remove all the prebuilt entities before starting the review process.

1. Make sure your Human Resources app is in the **Build** section of LUIS. You can change to this section by selecting **Build** on the top, right menu bar. 

    [ ![Screenshot of LUIS app with Build hightlighted in top, right navigation bar](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/hr-first-image.png)](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-list-entity/hr-first-image.png#lightbox)

2. Select **Entities** from the left navigation.

3. Select the three dots (...) menu, then select **Delete** for the following prebuilt entities: **datetimeV2**, **keyPhrase**, and **number**.

    After the utterances are reviewed and corrected, the prebuilt entities are added back to the model and trained. 

## Review endpoint utterances

1. Select **Review endpoint utterances** from the left navigation. The list is filtered for the **ApplyForJob** intent. 

2. Toggle the **Entities view** to see the labeled entities. 
    
    |Utterance|Correct intent|Missing entities|
    |:--|:--|:--|
    |I'm looking for a job with Natual Language Processing|GetJobInfo|Job - "Natural Language Process"|

    One of the utterances is not correct correct. The **ApplyForJob** intent has 21 utterances compared to the 7 utterances in **GetJobInformation**. Along with aligning the endpoint utterance correctly, more utterances should be added to the **GetJobInformation** intent. That will be left as an exercise for you to complete on your own. Each intent, except for the **None** intent, should have roughly the same number of example utterances. The **None** intent should have 10% of the total utterances in the app. 

3. For the intent `I'm looking for a job with Natual Language Processing`, select the correct intent, **GetJobInformation** in the **Aligned intent** column. 

4. In the same utterance, select `Natual Language Processing` then select the **Job** entity from the list.

5. On the same line, select the circled checkmark in the **Add to aligned intent** column. 

6. Review the remaining utterances in this intent, labeling utterances and correcting the **Aligned intent**, if these are incorrect.

7. When all the utterances are correct, select the checkbox on each row, then select **Add selected** to align the utterances correctly. 

8. The list should no longer have those utterances. Continue to work through the list, correcting intents and labeling any missing entities, until it is empty. Select the next intent in the Filter list, then continue correcting utterances and labeling entities. Remember the last step of each utterance is to either select **Add to aligned intent** on the utterance row or check the box by each intent and select **Add selected** above the table. This is a very small app. The review process will take a few minutes only.

## Add the prebuilt entities
Add the prebuilt entities back to the app.

1. Select **Entities** from the left navigation panel.

2. Select **Manage prebuilt entities** button.

3. Select **Number**, **datetimeV2**, **keyPhrase** then select **Done**.

## Train the LUIS app
LUIS doesn't know about the changes to the intents and entities (the model), until it is trained. 

1. In the top right side of the LUIS website, select the **Train** button.

    ![Train the app](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/train-button.png)

2. Training is complete when you see the green status bar at the top of the website confirming success.

    ![Training succeeded](./media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/trained.png)

## Publish the app to get the endpoint URL
In order to get a LUIS prediction in a chatbot or other application, you need to publish the app. 

1. In the top right side of the LUIS website, select the **Publish** button. 

2. Select the Production slot and the **Publish** button.

    [![](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/publish-to-production.png "Screenshot of Publish page with Publish to production slot button highlighted")](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-hier-entity/publish-to-production.png#lightbox)

3. Publishing is complete when you see the green status bar at the top of the website confirming success.

## Query the endpoint with an utterance

1. On the **Publish** page, select the **endpoint** link at the bottom of the page. This action opens another browser window with the endpoint URL in the address bar. 

    ![Screenshot of Publish page with endpoint url highlighted](media/luis-quickstart-intent-and-key-phrase/hr-endpoint-url-inline.png )

2. Go to the end of the URL in the address and enter `does form hrf-123456 cover the new dental benefits and medical plan`. The last querystring parameter is `q`, the utterance **query**. 

```
{
  "query": "does form hrf-123456 cover the new dental benefits and medical plan",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "FindForm",
    "score": 0.9300641

      "endIndex": 19
    },
    {
      "entity": "new dental benefits",
      "type": "builtin.keyPhrase",
      "startIndex": 31,
      "endIndex": 49
    },
    {
      "entity": "medical plan",
      "type": "builtin.keyPhrase",
      "startIndex": 55,
      "endIndex": 66
    },
    {
      "entity": "hrf",
      "type": "builtin.keyPhrase",
      "startIndex": 10,
      "endIndex": 12
    },
    {
      "entity": "-123456",
      "type": "builtin.number",
      "startIndex": 13,
      "endIndex": 19,
      "resolution": {
        "value": "-123456"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


## What has this tutorial accomplished?
This app, with keyPhrase entity detection, identified a natural language query intention and returned the extracted data including the main subject matter. 

Your chatbot now has enough information to determine the next step in the conversation. 

## Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the LUIS app. Select **My apps** in the top left menu. Select the three dot menu (...) to the right of the app name in the app list, select **Delete**. On the pop-up dialog **Delete app?**, select **Ok**.
