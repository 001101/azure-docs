#Customer intent: As a new user, I want to deploy a LUIS app in the LUIS portal so I can understand the process of putting the model on the prediction endpoint.

# Quickstart:Deploy app in LUIS portal

Once the app is ready to return predictions for utterances, you need to deploy the app to the prediction endpoint. The LUIS portal is the most common method, but you can also use programmatic methods. 

In this quickstart, you learn to deploy an application by creating a prediction endpoint runtime key, assigning the key to the app, training the app, and publishing the app. 

If you donâ€™t have a free LUIS portal account, you can create the free account the first time you visit the LUIS portal.  

## Prerequisites

* Sign in to the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).

## Create prediction endpoint runtime key

## Assign key to app
FindForm

## Train the app

## Publish the app 

Tag entity in example utterance
`HRF-number regular express

// add example utterance with 1 entity to intent
