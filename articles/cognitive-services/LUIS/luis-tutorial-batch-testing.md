# Use batch testing to find prediction accuracy issues

This tutorial demonstrates how to use batch testing to find utterance prediction issues.  

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
* Create a batch test file 
* Run a batch test
* Review test results

## Prerequisites

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Quickstart](luis-get-started-create-app.md) using Home Automation. Make sure the prebuilt HomeAutomation domain is trained. 

> [!Tip]

## How batch testing improves prediction
Batch testing can test up to 1000 utterances at a time with the current model. The batch should not have duplicates and should not have utterances already in the model -- either through [adding the utterance to an intent](add-example-utterances.md), or by [reviewing suggested utterances from the endpoint](label-suggested-utterances.md). [Export](create-new-app.md#export-app) the app in order to see the list of current utterances. The original utterances from the prebuilt HomeAutomation app are available [here]() to review. 

The HomeAutomation app predicts utterances such as "Turn on all the lights" and "Turn off the heat in the living room". 

## Test data strategy
The test data strategy for LUIS has three separate sets of data: model utterances, batch test utterances, and endpoint utterances. For this tutorial, make sure you are not using the utterances from either model utterances (added to an intent), or endpoint utterances. 

The HomeAutomation prebuilt domain includes the following utterances. The [exported app](luis-glossary.md#batch-test-json-file) is in the LUIS-Samples repository. Do not use any of these utterances in the batch test:

```
  'breezeway on please',
  'change temperature to seventy two degrees',
  'coffee bar on please',
  'decrease temperature for me please',
  'dim kitchen lights to 25 .',
  'fish pond off please',
  'fish pond on please',
  'illuminate please',
  'living room lamp on please',
  'living room lamps off please',
  'lock the doors for me please',
  'lower your volume',
  'make camera 1 off please',
  'make some coffee',
  'play dvd',
  'set lights bright',
  'set lights concentrate',
  'set lights out bedroom',
  'shut down my work computer',
  'silence the phone',
  'snap switch fan fifty percent',
  'start master bedroom light .',
  'theater on please',
  'turn dimmer off',
  'turn off ac please',
  'turn off foyer lights',
  'turn off living room light',
  'turn off staircase',
  'turn off venice lamp',
  'turn on bathroom heater',
  'turn on external speaker',
  'turn on my bedroom lights .',
  'turn on the furnace room lights',
  'turn on the internet in my bedroom please',
  'turn on thermostat please',
  'turn the fan to high',
  'turn thermostat on 70 .' 
```

## Create a batch testing intents
1. Create `homeauto-batch-1.json` in a text editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The [file]() is also available in the LUIS-Samples repository. 

2. Add utterances to the file. These utterances should be successful. Take utterances in the HomeAutomation.TurnOn and HomeAutomation.TurnOff and switch the `on` and `off` text in the utterances. For the None intent, add a couple of utterances that are not part of the subject area. 

    This test is slanted toward successful predictions in order to illustrate the process. 

    ```JSON
    [
        {
          "text": "lobby on please",
          "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "change temperature to seventy one degrees",
          "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "where is my pizza",
          "intent": "None",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "call Jack at work",
          "intent": "None",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "breezeway off please",
          "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
          "entities": []
        },
        {
          "text": "coffee bar off please",
          "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
          "entities": []
        }
    ]
    ```
    
## Run the batch
1. Select **Test** in the top navigation bar. 
2. Select **Batch testing panel** in the right-side panel. 
3. Select **Import dataset**
4. Choose the file system location of the `homeauto-batch-1.json` file.
5. Name the dataset `set `.
6. Select the **Run** button. Wait until the batch test is done.
7. Select **See results**.

## Review batch results
The batch results are in two sections. The top section contains the graph and the legend. The bottom section displays utterances when you select an area of the graph or legend.

Any errors are indicated by the color red. The graph is in four sections, with two of the sections displayed in red. These are the sections to focus on. 

The top right section indicates the test incorrectly predicted the existence of an intent or entity. The bottom left section indicates the test incorrectly predicted the absence of an intent or entity.

### HomeAutomation.TurnOff test results
In the legend, select the **HomeAutomation.TurnOff** intent. It has a green success icon to the left of the name in the legend. The Utterance count is after the name. 

![Legend for HomeAutomation.TurnOff]()

The batch utterances have six intents in the legend, instead of only the two utterances for this intent from the batch. There are six intents tested to make sure the other four do not get this intent. When you select the intent in the legend, the 2 successfully predictions for the intent on in the top left of the chart. The 4 predictions that should not go to this intent are in the bottom right.

### HomeAutomation.TurnOn and None intents test results
The other two intents have errors, meaning the batch test predictions didn't match the batch file expectations. Select the None intent in the legend. 

The two intents in the left bottom panel, in red, are the failures. Select **False Negative** in the chart in that second to see the utterances that failed. 

The two failing utterances, based on the batch test file, should have been labeled as None intent but were instead labeled HomeAutomation.TurnOn intent. Because of this failure both intents'
expectations (HomeAutomation.TurnOn and None) failed.

To fix the app, the utterances currently in the None intent need to be moved into the correct intent and the None intent needs new and appropriate intents. 

Three of the utterances in the None intent are meant to lower the automation device such. They use words such as dim, lower, or decrease. The fourth utterance asks to turn on the internet. Since all four utterances are about turning or changing the degree of power to a device, they should be moved to the HomeAutomation.TurnOn intent. 

If there was an intent for ChangeDeviceSetting, these would be a good intent for the three utterances using dim, lower, and decrease. 

## Fix the app based on batch results
Instead of creating a new intent, move the four utterances to the HomeAutomation.TurnOn intent. 

1. To fix the app so the batch is successful, exit the batch test panel by selecting **Test** in the top navigation panel.

2. Select **Intents** in the left navigation panel. 
3. Select the `None` intent.  
4. Select the checkout above the utterance list so all utterances are selected. 
5. In the **Reassign intent** drop-down, select HomeAutomation.TurnOn.
6. Add 4 new intents for the None intent:

    ```
    "When is the game?"
    "Call Mom about the party."
    "The recipe calls for more milk."
    "The pizza is done."
    ```

7. Because none of these utterances have a HomeAutomation.Device ("light", "camera"), HomeAutomation.Operation("on","off") or HomeAutomation.Room ("living room"), remove any labels. 
8. Train and publish the app.

## Verify the fix
In order to verify that the utterances in the batch test are now correctly predicted for the None intent, run the batch test again.

1. Select **Test** in the top navigation bar. 
2. Select **Batch testing panel** in the right-side panel. 
3. Select the three dots (...) to the right of the batch name and select **Run Dataset**. Wait until the batch test is done.
4. Select **See results**. The intents should all have green icons to the left of the intent names. The score of `breezeway off please` is very low at 0.24. An optional activity is to add more utterances to the intent to increase this score. 

<!-- WAITING ON FIX

The Entities section of the legend may have errors. That is the next thing to fix.

## Create a batch testing with entities
1. Create `homeauto-batch-2.json` in a text editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The [file]() is also available in the LUIS-Samples repository. 

2. Add utterances to the file with entities. 

```JSON
[
  {
    "text": "lobby on please",
    "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Room",
        "startPos": 0,
        "endPos": 4
      },
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Operation",
        "startPos": 6,
        "endPos": 7
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "text": "change temperature to seventy one degrees",
    "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Device",
        "startPos": 7,
        "endPos": 17
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "text": "where is my pizza",
    "intent": "None",
    "entities": []
  },
  {
    "text": "call Jack at work",
    "intent": "None",
    "entities": []
  },
  {
    "text": "breezeway off please",
    "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Room",
        "startPos": 0,
        "endPos": 8
      },
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Operation",
        "startPos": 10,
        "endPos": 12
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "text": "coffee bar off please",
    "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Room",
        "startPos": 0,
        "endPos": 9
      },
      {
        "entity": "HomeAutomation.Operation",
        "startPos": 11,
        "endPos": 13
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
