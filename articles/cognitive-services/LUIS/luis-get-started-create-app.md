# Quickstart: Use prebuilt Home automation app

In this quickstart, create a LUIS app that uses the prebuilt domain `HomeAutomation` for turning lights and appliances on and off. This prebuilt domain provides intents, entities, and example utterances for you. When you're finished, you'll have a LUIS endpoint running in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

For this article, you need a free LUIS account, created on the LUIS portal at [https://www.luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai). 

[!INCLUDE [Sign in to LUIS](./includes/sign-in-process.md)]

## Create a new app
You can create and manage your applications on **My Apps**. 

1. Select **+ Create**.

    [![Screenshot of app list](./media/luis-quickstart-new-app/app-list.png "Screenshot of app list")](./media/luis-quickstart-new-app/app-list.png)

1. In the dialog box, name your application "Home Automation".

    [![Screenshot of Create new app pop-up dialog](media/luis-quickstart-new-app/create-new-app-dialog.png "Screenshot of Create new app pop-up dialog")](media/luis-quickstart-new-app/create-new-app-dialog.png)

1. Choose your application culture. For this Home Automation app, choose English. Then select **Done**. LUIS creates the Home Automation app. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >The culture cannot be changed once the application is created. 

## Add prebuilt domain

Select **Prebuilt domains** in the left-side navigation pane. Then search for "Home". Select **Add domain**.

When the domain is successfully added, the prebuilt domain box displays a **Remove domain** button.

## Intents and entities

Select **Intents** in the left-side navigation pane to review the HomeAutomation domain intents. Each intent has sample utterances.

> [!NOTE]
> **None** is an intent provided by all LUIS apps. You use it to handle utterances that don't correspond to functionality your app provides. 

Select the **HomeAutomation.TurnOff** intent. You can see that the intent contains a list of utterances that are labeled with entities.

## Train the LUIS app

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Train steps](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-train.md)]

## Test your app
Once you've trained your app, you can test it. Select **Test** in the top navigation. Type a test utterance like "Turn off the lights" into the Interactive Testing pane, and press Enter. 

```
Turn off the lights
```

Check that the top scoring intent corresponds to the intent you expected for each test utterance.

In this example, `Turn off the lights` is correctly identified as the top scoring intent of **HomeAutomation.TurnOff**.

Select **Inspect** to review more information about the prediction.

Select **Test** again to collapse the test pane.

## Publish the app to get the endpoint URL

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to Publish steps](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-tutorial-how-to-publish.md)]

<a name="query-the-v2-api-prediction-endpoint"></a>

## Query the V3 API prediction endpoint

[!INCLUDE [LUIS How to get endpoint first step](./includes/how-to-get-v3-prediction-endpoint.md)] 

1. In the browser address bar, for the query string, make sure the following name and value bars are in the URL. If they are not in the query string, add them:

    |Name/value pair|
    |--|
    |`verbose=true`|
    |`show-all-intents=true`|

1. In the browser address bar, go to the end of the URL and enter `turn off the living room light` for the _query_ value, then press Enter.

    ```json
    {
        "query": "turn off the living room light",
        "prediction": {
            "normalizedQuery": "turn off the living room light",
