# Batch testing in LUIS

Batch testing is a comprehensive test on your current trained model to measure its performance in LUIS. A batch test helps you view the performance of each intent and entity in your current trained model on a specific set of utterances. Use utterances LUIS has not seen before in either the model or the endpoint. This testing helps you take appropriate actions, when required, to improve performance, such as adding more example utterances to an intent if your app frequently fails to identify it.

## JSON file with no duplicates
You submit a batch file of utterances, known as a *dataset*. The dataset is JSON format and contains a maximum of 1,000 labeled **non-duplicate** utterances. Duplicates are considered exact string matches, not matches that are tokenized first. 

|**Rules**|
|--|
|No duplicate utterances|
|No hierarchical entity children|
|1000 utterances or less|


Import this file and run the test. The result is a comparison of the dataset labeled intent and the current model's predicted intent. This difference helps you find utterances that LUIS predicts incorrectly based on its current training. 

You can test 10 dataset files in a single LUIS app. The utterances included in the dataset should be different from the example utterances you previously added while building your app. 

[Batch testing](luis-how-to-batch-test.md) allows LUIS to test up to 10 sets of 1,000 utterances and score the batch in a graphical manner so you can see the results as a group. The results can be broken up in to intents, entities, and you can select individual points on the graph to review the utterance information.

It is important that utterances used for batch testing are new to LUIS. If you have a dataset of utterances, divide the utterances into three sets: utterances add to the model, utterances received from the published endpoint, and utterances used to batch test LUIS after it is trained. 

If there are errors in the batch testing, you can either add more labels to help LUIS make the discrimination between intents or add a [phrase list](luis-concept-feature.md) feature with domain-specific vocabulary to help LUIS learn faster. 

## Example batch file
An example of the JSON in the batch file follows:

   [!code-json[Valid batch test](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/batch-testing/travel-agent-1.json)]

## Common errors importing a batch
Common errors include: 

> * more than 1,000 utterances
> * an utterance JSON object that doesn't have an entities property

**Successful predictions** are utterances where the intent in the batch file is the same intent predicted in the test.

In the preceding screenshot:
 
 - **State** includes ready to run, erroring results, or successful results. 
 - **Size** is the total number of utterances included in the dataset file.
 - **Last Run** is the date of the latest test run for this dataset. 
 - **Last Result** displays the number of successful predictions in the last test run.

## Access batch test result details in a visualized view
 Select the **See results** link that appears after you run the test. A scatter graph known as an error matrix displays. The data points represent the utterances in the dataset. 

Green points indicate correct prediction, and red ones indicate incorrect prediction.

The filtering panel on the right side of the screen displays a list of all intents and entities in the app, with a green point for intents/entities that were predicted correctly in all dataset utterances, and a red point for those items with errors. Also, for each intent/entity, you can see the number of correct predictions out of the total utterances.

## Sections of the results chart
Data points on the **[False Positive][false-positive]** and **[False Negative][false-negative]** sections indicate errors, which should be investigated. If all data points are on the **[True Positive][true-positive]** and **[True Negative][true-negative]** sections, then your application's performance is perfect on this dataset.

The graph indicates [F-measure][f-measure], [recall][recall], and [precision][precision]. 

## Best practice - three sets of data
Developers should have three sets of test data. The first is for building the model, the second is for testing the model at the endpoint. The third is used in [batch testing](luis-how-to-batch-test.md). The first set is not used in training the application nor sent on the endpoint.
