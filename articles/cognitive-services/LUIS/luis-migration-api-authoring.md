# Authoring changes for V2 and V3

The authoring APIs are updated, for both V2 and V3, to allow for model decomposition with machine-learned entities. Use this guide to understand how to use these new authoring APIs. 

The V3 API provides the following new features to support model decomposition:

* [Machine-learned entities](#machine-learned-entities)
* [Descriptors](#descriptors)
* [Constraints](#constraints)
