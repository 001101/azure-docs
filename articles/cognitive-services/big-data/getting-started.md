# Getting started 

Setting up your environment is the first step to building a pipeline for your data. 
After your environment is ready, running a sample is quick and easy. 

We'll walk through the following steps to get started:
1. Create a Cognitive Services resource
1. Create an Apache Spark Cluster
1. Try a sample

## Step 1: Create a Cognitive Services resource

To use the Big Data Cognitive Services, we must first create a Cognitive Service for our workflow. 
There are two main types of Cognitive Services: cloud services hosted in Azure and containerized services managed by users.
We suggest beginning with the simpler cloud-based Cognitive Services.

### Cloud services

Cloud-based Cognitive Services are intelligent algorithms hosted in Azure. These services are ready for use without training, as long as your application has an internet connection.
 You can [create a Cognitive Service in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows). 
 Additionally, you can [create a service with the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli?tabs=windows).

### Containerized services (optional)

If your application or workload uses extremely large datasets, requires private networking, or can't contact the cloud,
 communicating with cloud services might be impossible. 
 In this situation, containerized Cognitive Services provide the following benefits:

* **Low Connectivity**: You can deploy containerized Cognitive Services in 
any computing environment, both on-cloud and off. If your application can't contact the cloud, 
consider deploying containerized Cognitive Services on your application.

* **Low Latency**: Because containerized services don't require the round-trip communication to and from the cloud,
 responses are returned with much lower latencies.

* **Privacy and Data Security**: You can deploy containerized services into private networks,
 so that sensitive data doesn't leave the network.

* **High Scalability**: Containerized services don't have "rate limits" and run on user-managed computers.
 So, you can scale Cognitive Services without end to handle much larger workloads.

Follow [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-container-support?tabs=luis) 
to create a containerized Cognitive Service.

## Step 2: Create an Apache Spark cluster

[Apache Sparkâ„¢](http://spark.apache.org/) is a distributed computing framework designed for big-data data processing. 
Users can work with Apache Spark in Azure with services like Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics,
 HDInsight, and Azure Kubernetes Services. 
 To use the Big Data Cognitive Services, we must first create a cluster. 
 If you already have a Spark cluster, feel free to try an example.

### Azure Databricks

Azure Databricks is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform with a one-click setup,
 streamlined workflows, and an interactive workspace.
  It's often used to collaborate between data scientists, engineers, and business analysts.

To use the Big Data Cognitive Services on Azure Databricks, do the following steps:

1. [Create an Azure Databricks workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-databricks/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal#create-an-azure-databricks-workspace)

1. [Create a Spark cluster in Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-databricks/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal#create-a-spark-cluster-in-databricks)

1. Install the Big Data Cognitive Services
    * Create a new library in your databricks workspace

       <img src="media/create_library.png" alt="Create library" width="50%"/>

    * Input the following maven coordinates
      
      Coordinates:  `com.microsoft.ml.spark:mmlspark_2.11:1.0.0-rc1`

      Repository: `https://mmlspark.azureedge.net/maven`
      
      <img src="media/lib_coords.png" alt="Library Coordinates" width="50%"/>

    * Install the library onto a cluster
      
      <img src="media/install_lib.png" alt="Install Library on Cluster" width="50%"/>


### Synapse Analytics

You can optionally use Synapse Analytics to create a spark cluster.
 Azure Synapse Analytics brings together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics.
  It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless on-demand or provisioned resources at scale.

To get started using Synapse Analytics, do the following steps:

1. [Create a Synapse Workspace (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-workspace).

1. [Create a new Apache Spark pool (preview) using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool-portal).

In Synapse Analytics, the Big Data Cognitive Services are already installed by default. 

### Azure Kubernetes Service

If you're using containerized Cognitive Services, one popular option for deploying Spark alongside containers is Azure Kubernetes Service. 

To get started on Azure Kubernetes Service:
1. [Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal)
1. [Install the Apache Spark 2.4.0 helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/microsoft/spark)
1. [Install a cognitive service container using Helm](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/deploy-computer-vision-on-premises)

## Step 3: Try a sample

Once you set up your Spark cluster and environment, we can run a short sample. This section demonstrates how to use the Big Data Cognitive Services in Azure Databricks.

First, we can create a notebook in Azure Databricks. For other Spark cluster providers, use their notebooks or Spark Submit. 

1. Create a new Databricks notebook, by choosing **New notebook** from the **Azure Databricks** menu.

    <img src="assets/new-notebook.png" alt="Create a new notebook" width="50%"/>

1. In the **Create Notebook** dialog box, enter a name, select **Python** as the language,
 and select the Spark cluster that you created earlier.
   
    <img src="assets/databricks-notebook-details.jpg" alt="New notebook details" width="50%"/>

    Select **Create**.
1. Copy/paste the code snippet below into your new notebook.
```python
from mmlspark.cognitive import *
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Add your subscription key from Text Analytics (or a general Cognitive Service key)
service_key = "ADD-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY-HERE"

df = spark.createDataFrame([
  ("I am so happy today, its sunny!", "en-US"),
  ("I am frustrated by this rush hour traffic", "en-US"),
  ("The cognitive services on spark aint bad", "en-US"),
], ["text", "language"])

sentiment = (TextSentiment()
    .setTextCol("text")
    .setLocation("eastus")
    .setSubscriptionKey(service_key)
    .setOutputCol("sentiment")
    .setErrorCol("error")
    .setLanguageCol("language"))

results = sentiment.transform(df)

# Show the results in a table
display(results.select("text", col("sentiment")[0].getItem("score").alias("sentiment")))

```

1. Get your subscription key from the **Keys and Endpoint** menu from your Text Analytics dashboard in the Azure portal.
1. Replace the subscription key placeholder in your Databricks notebook code with your subscription key.
1. Select the play, or triangle, symbol in the upper right of your notebook cell to run the sample.
 Optionally select **Run All** at the top of your notebook to run all cells. 
 The answers will display below the cell in a table.

### Expected results

| text                                      |   sentiment |
|:------------------------------------------|------------:|
| I am so happy today, its sunny!           |   0.978959  |
| I am frustrated by this rush hour traffic |   0.0237956 |
| The cognitive services on spark aint bad  |   0.888896  |
