# Recipe: Using Cognitive Services on Spark for Predictive Maintenance

This example will walk you through how you can use Azure Synapse Analytics and Cognitive Services on Spark for predictive maintenance of IoT devices. Our example follows along with the [CosmosDB and Synapse Link](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cosmosdb-synapse-link-samples) sample. However, for simplicity's sake, we'll read the data straight from a CSV file rather than getting streamed data through CosmosDB and Synapse Link. We strongly encourage you to look over the Synapse Link sample.

## Business Scenario
(From CosmosDB sample) The hypothetical scenario is Power Plant, where IoT devices are monitoring  [steam turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_turbine). The IoTSignals collection has Revolutions per minute (RPM) and Megawatts (MW) data for each turbine. Signals from steam turbines are being analyzed and anomalous signals are detected.

There could be outliers in the data in random frequency. In those situations, RPM values will go up and MW output will go down, for circuit protection. The idea is to see the data varying at the same time, but with different signals.

## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* [Azure Synapse workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-workspace) configured with a [Spark pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool)

## Setup
### Create an Anomaly Detector Resource
Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for Translator using the  [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account)  
or  [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli)  on your local machine. You can also:

-   Get a  [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services)  valid for 7 days for free. After signing up, it will be available on the Azure website.
-   View an existing resource in the  [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

Be sure to make a note of the endpoint and the key for this resource.

### Load data into Azure Synapse Analytics
1. From the Data / Linked tab of your Synapse workspace, create an IoTData folder within the root directory of the storage account that is attached to the Synapse workspace.
2. Upload the two CSV files downloaded from [this folder](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cosmosdb-synapse-link-samples/tree/master/IoT/IoTData).
3. In the Azure Portal, go to the Access Control (IAM) tab of the storage account associated with Synapse workspace, click on the +Add and Add a role assignment and add yourself to the Data Contributor role. This role is needed for any Spark metadata operations such as creating databases and tables using the Azure Synapse Spark Pool.

## Read data from storage into a DataFrame
We'll read the IoTSignals file into a DataFrame. Open a new notebook in your Synapse workspace and create a DataFrame from the file.
```python
dfDeviceInfo = spark.read.csv("/IoTData/IoTSignals.csv", header=True)
```
### Run anomaly detection using Cognitive Services on Spark
Our goal is to find instances where the signals from the IoT devices were outputting anomalous values so that we can see when something is going wrong and do predictive maintenance. 

To do that, we use Anomaly Detector on Spark:
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
from mmlspark.cognitive import SimpleDetectAnomalies
from mmlspark.core.spark import FluentAPI

ateor = (SimpleDetectAnomalies()
    .setSubscriptionKey("paste-your-key-here")
    .setUrl("paste-your-endpoint-here")
    .setOutputCol("anomalies")
    .setGroupbyCol("grouping")
    .setSensitivity(95)
    .setGranularity("secondly"))

df_anomaly = (df_IoTSignals
    .where(col("unitSymbol") == 'RPM')
    .withColumnRenamed("dateTime", "timestamp")
    .withColumn("value", col("measureValue").cast("double"))
    .withColumn("grouping", struct("deviceId"))
    .mlTransform(ateeor))

df_anomaly.createOrReplaceTempView('df_anomaly')
```
Replace "paste-your-key-here" and "paste-your-endpoint-here" with the key and the endpoint for your Anomaly Detector resource, respectively.

 ## Visualize anomalies for one of the devices
IoTSignals.csv has signals from multiple IoT devices. We'll focus on a specific device and visualize anomalous outputs from the device.
```python
df_anomaly_single_device = spark.sql("select timestamp \                                           
                                       , measureValue \
                                       , anomalies.expectedValue \
                                       , anomalies.expectedValue + anomalies.upperMargin as expectedUpperValue \
                                       , anomalies.expectedValue - anomalies.lowerMargin as expectedLowerValue \
                                       , case when anomalies.isAnomaly=true then 1 else 0 end as isAnomaly \
                                  from df_anomaly \
                                  where deviceid = 'dev-1' and timestamp < '2020-04-29'\
                                  order by timestamp \
                                  limit 200")
```
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
 
adf = df_anomaly_single_device.toPandas()
adf_subset = df_anomaly_single_device.where(col("isAnomaly") == 1).toPandas() 

plt.figure(figsize=(23,8))
plt.plot(adf['timestamp'],adf['expectedUpperValue'], color='darkred', linestyle='solid', linewidth=0.25)
plt.plot(adf['timestamp'],adf['expectedValue'], color='darkgreen', linestyle='solid', linewidth=2)
plt.plot(adf['timestamp'],adf['measureValue'], 'b', color='royalblue', linestyle='dotted', linewidth=2)
plt.plot(adf['timestamp'],adf['expectedLowerValue'],  color='black', linestyle='solid', linewidth=0.25)
plt.plot(adf_subset['timestamp'],adf_subset['measureValue'], 'ro')
plt.legend(['RPM-UpperMargin', 'RPM-ExpectedValue', 'RPM-ActualValue', 'RPM-LowerMargin', 'RPM-Anomaly'])
plt.title('RPM Anomalies with Expected, Actual, Upper and Lower Values')
plt.show()
```
