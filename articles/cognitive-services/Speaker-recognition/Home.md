# Speaker Recognition API

Speaker Recognition APIs are cloud-based APIs that provide the advanced AI algorithms for speaker verification and speaker identification. Speaker Recognition is divided into two categories: speaker verification and speaker identification.

## Speaker Verification

Voice has unique characteristics to identify a person, just like a fingerprint.  Applications can use voice and passphrases as signals to simplify the authentication experience in scenarios like call centers authentication, web services, and smart building.

Speaker Verification APIs serve an intelligent tool to automatically verify users using both their voice and speech phrases.

### Enrollment

Enrollment for speaker verification is text-dependent, which means that the speaker needs to choose a specific passphrase during both enrollment and verification phases.

In the enrollment phase, the speaker's voice is recorded saying a specific phrase. Many features are extracted to form a unique voice signature while the chosen phrase is recognized. Together, both the voice signature and the chosen phrase would be used to verify the speaker's identity.

The speech audio and features extracted are stored in a highly secure way. You can create, update, and remove the enrollment audio and the voice signatures through API calls. When the subscription is removed, all the stored data under the subscription ID would be removed automatically.

### Verification

In the verification phase, the speaker verification algorithm extracts many features from the input speech recording. Then it compares the features against the voice signature of the known speaker and determines any match.  Also, the speech recognition algorithm compares the speech phrases with the passphrases chosen by the known speaker.  The response returns "accept" or "reject" with different confidence levels.  Both results would be used to verify whether this person is the known speaker saying the correct passphrase.

The threshold is related to the scenario. We recommend you to experiment with the confidence level for the wanted accuracy.

The speech recording or the extracted features wouldn't be stored.

## Speaker Identification

Applications can use voice to identify "who is speaking" given a group of speakers. Speaker Identification APIs can be used in scenarios like meeting productivity, personalization, call center transcription.

### Enrollment

Enrollment for speaker identification is text-independent, which means that there's no restriction on what the speaker says in the audio.

In the enrollment phase, the speaker's voice is recorded, and many features are extracted to form a unique voice signature. The speech audio and features extracted are stored in a highly secure way. You can create, update, and remove the enrollment audio and the voice signature through API calls. When the subscription is removed, all the stored data under the subscription ID would be removed automatically.

### Identification

In the identification phase, the speaker identification algorithm extracted many features from the input speech recording. Then it compares the features against the voice signature of each speaker in the group. When the best match is found, the response returns the ID of the speaker with different confidence levels.  Otherwise, the response returns "reject" when no speaker is a match.

The threshold is related to the scenario. We recommend you to experiment with the confidence level for the wanted accuracy.

The speech recording or the extracted features wouldn't be stored.
