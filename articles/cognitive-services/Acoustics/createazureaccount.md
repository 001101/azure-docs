# Setup Azure Accounts for Acoustics
Follow this guide for setting up Azure Batch and Storage accounts necessary for working with acoustics. For information about the Unity plugin developed as part of Project Acoustics, see [What is acoustics](what-is-acoustics.md). For information about how to incorporate acoustics into your Unity project, see [Getting Started](gettingstarted.md).  

## Get an Azure Subscription
An [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) is required before setting up Batch and Storage accounts. If you're signing up for the first time, Azure provides a few time-limited free resources and $200 credit.

## Create Azure Batch and Storage Accounts
Next, follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-account-create-portal) to set up your Azure Batch and associated Azure Storage accounts.

Pick default options for both Batch and Storage accounts:
  
  ![New Batch Account](media/NewBatchAccountCreate.png)

  ![New Storage Account](media/BatchStorageAccountCreate.png)

It takes a few minutes for Azure to deploy the accounts. Look for a completion notification in the upper right corner on the portal.

Your accounts should now be visible on your dashboard.
