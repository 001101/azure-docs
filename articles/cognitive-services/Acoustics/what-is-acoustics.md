# What is acoustics?
The Unity plugin developed as part of Project Acoustics provides occlusion, obstruction, reverberation, and spatialization for VR and traditional titles on Windows and Android. It provides a way to design game acoustics that layers designer intentions over a physics-based wave simulation.

## Today's approach to acoustics
Let's revisit today's most common approach to acoustics. In the existing approach, you draw reverb volumes:

Then you tweak parameters for each zone:

Finally, you engage the developer team to add ray-tracing logic to get the right occlusion/obstruction filtering throughout the scene. The resulting logic has a run-time cost, in addition to problems with smoothness around corners. Adding a path search for portaling can also be expensive and have problems with edge cases.

## Physics-based design
With the approach provided by Project Acoustics' Unity plugin, you provide a static scene’s shape and materials. Because the scene is voxelized and the process doesn't use ray-tracing, it's not necessary to provide a simplified or watertight acoustics mesh. It's also not necessary to mark up the scene with other acoustics volumes or metadata. The plugin uploads the scene to Azure, where it analyzes the scene’s acoustics using wave simulation. The result is integrated into the title as a lookup table, and can be modified for aesthetic or gameplay effects globally, and on a per-sound-source basis.
