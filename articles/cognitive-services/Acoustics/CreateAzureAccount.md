# Setup Azure Accounts for Acoustics
Follow this guide for setting up Azure Batch and Storage accounts necessary for working with Microsoft Acoustics. For information about Microsoft Acoustics, see [Introduction to Microsoft Acoustics](What-Is-Acoustics.md). For information about how to incorporate Microsoft Acoustics into your Unity project, see [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md).  


### **Step 1 -** Get an Azure Subscription
An [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) is required before setting up Batch and Storage accounts. For those signing up for the first time, Azure provides a few time limited free resources and $200 credit which you can use towards cloud bakes for Microsoft Acoustics.

### **Step 2 -** Create Azure Batch and Storage Accounts
Next, please follow [these instructions]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-account-create-portal)) to setup your Azure Batch and associated Azure Storage accounts.

* Pick default options for both Batch and Storage accounts

* It takes a few minutes for Azure to deploy the accounts. Look for a completion notification in the upper right corner on the portal.

* Your accounts should now be visible on your dashboard.

### **Step 3 -** Setup Microsoft Acoustics Bake UI with Azure Credentials
This is the last remaning step before you can start scheduling acoustics bakes on the cloud. 

* Click on the Batch account link on the dashboard.
* Click on the "Keys" link on the Batch account page to access your credentials.
