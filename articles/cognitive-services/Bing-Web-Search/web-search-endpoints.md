Web Search API
The Bing APIs support search actions that return various kinds of results. The Web Search API returns Web pages, news items, images, videos, and entities that contain summary information about a person, place, or a defined subject. Each of these result types have endpoints that return specifically typed results or details. 

All search endpoints return results as JSON response objects.  All endpoints support queries that return results in a specified language and/or location by longitude, latitude, and search radius. For complete information about the parameters supported by each endpoint, see the [Search API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference) pages.
