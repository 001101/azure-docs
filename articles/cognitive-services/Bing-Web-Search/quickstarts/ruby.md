## Prerequisites

* [Ruby 2.4 or later](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)  

## Make a call to the Bing Web Search API

To run this application, follow these steps.

1. Create a new Ruby project in your favorite IDE or editor.
2. Copy this sample code into your project:  
    ```ruby
    require 'net/https'
    require 'uri'
    require 'json'

    # **********************************************
    # *** Update or verify the following values. ***
    # **********************************************

    # Replace the accessKey string value with a valid subscription key.
    accessKey = "enter key here"

    # Verify the endpoint URI.  At this writing, only one endpoint is used for Bing
    # search APIs.  In the future, regional endpoints may be available.  If you
    # encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check this value against
    # the endpoint for your Bing Web search instance in your Azure dashboard.

    uri  = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
    path = "/bing/v7.0/search"

    term = "Microsoft Cognitive Services"

    if accessKey.length != 32 then
        puts "Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!"
        puts "Please paste yours into the source code."
        abort
    end

    uri = URI(uri + path + "?q=" + URI.escape(term))

    puts "Searching the Web for: " + term

    # Create the request and get a JSON response.
    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
    request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = accessKey

    response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
        http.request(request)
    end

    puts "\nRelevant Headers:\n\n"
    response.each_header do |key, value|
        # Header names are lowee-cased.
        if key.start_with?("bingapis-") or key.start_with?("x-msedge-") then
            puts key + ": " + value
        end
    end

    puts "\nJSON Response:\n\n"
    puts JSON::pretty_generate(JSON(response.body))
    ```
3. Replace `accessKey` with a valid subscription key.
4. Run the program. For example: `ruby your_program.rb`.

## Sample response

Responses from the Bing Web Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
