# Call and response: your first Bing Web Search query in Go

The Bing Web Search API is similar to Bing.com, returning search results relevant to the user's query. The results may include Web pages, images, videos, news, and entities, along with related search queries, spelling corrections, time zones, unit conversion, translations, and calculations. The results are based on their relevance and the tier of the Bing Search APIs to which you subscribe.

Refer to the [API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-web-api-v7-reference) for details about the APIs.

## Prerequisites
You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **Bing Search APIs**. The [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) is sufficient for this quickstart. You need the access key provided when you activate your free trial, or you may use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard.

Install the [Go binaries](https://golang.org/dl/).
 
This tutorial uses only **core** libraries, so there are no external dependencies.

## Core Libraries

Use `http` to send the request to the endpoint, `ioutil`, read the answer, and `fmt` to print the output

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "io/iutil"
)
```

## Define variables
Set the API endpoint and the search term.

```
//This is the valid endpoint at the time of the writing
const endpoint = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/search"
//API token
token := "YOUR-ACCESS-KEY"
searchTerm := "Microsoft Cognitive Services"
```

## Building and sending the request

```
//We declare a new GET request
req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", endpoint, nil)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
//Add the payload to the request
param := req.URL.Query()
param.Add("q", searchTerm)
//Encoding the payload
req.URL.RawQuery = param.Encode()

//Insert the API token in the request header
req.Header.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", token)

//create new client
client := new(http.Client)
//Send the request
resp, err := client.Do(req)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
//Close the response body at the function exit
defer resp.Body.Close() 
```

## Printing the answer
The search result is inside the `resp` variable. Print the answer body from the variable.

```
body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
//Convert body from byte to string.
fmt.Println(string(body))
```

## Put everything together

```
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "io/ioutil"
)

func main() {
    const endpoint = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/search"
    token := "YOUR-ACCESS-KEY"
    searchTerm := "Microsoft Cognitive Services"
    
    req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", endpoint, nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    
    param := req.URL.Query()
    param.Add("q", searchTerm)
    req.URL.RawQuery = param.Encode()

    req.Header.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", token)
    
    client := new(http.Client)
    resp, err := client.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close() 
    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```
