# Quickstart for Bing Web Search API with Python

This article shows you how to use the Bing Search API, part of Microsoft Cognitive Services on Azure. While this article employs Python, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON. 

The example code was written to run under Python 3.

Refer to the [API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-web-api-v7-reference) for technical details about the APIs.

## Prerequisites

You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **Bing Search APIs**. The [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) is sufficient for this quickstart. You need the access key provided when you activate your free trial, or you may use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard.

## Bing Web search

The [Bing Web Search API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-web-api-v7-reference) returns Web search results from the Bing search engine.

1. Create a new Python project in your favorite IDE or editor.
2. Add the provided code.
3. Replace the `subscriptionKey` value with an access key valid for your subscription.
4. Run the program.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import http.client, urllib.parse, json

# **********************************************
# *** Update or verify the following values. ***
# **********************************************

# Replace the subscriptionKey string value with your valid subscription key.
subscriptionKey = "enter key here"

# Verify the endpoint URI.  At this writing, only one endpoint is used for Bing
# search APIs.  In the future, regional endpoints may be available.  If you
# encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check this value against
# the endpoint for your Bing Web search instance in your Azure dashboard.
host = "api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
path = "/bing/v7.0/search"

term = "Microsoft Cognitive Services"

def BingWebSearch(search):
	"Performs a Bing Web search and returns the results."

	headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey}
	conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(host)
	query = urllib.parse.quote(search)
	conn.request("GET", path + "?q=" + query, headers=headers)
	response = conn.getresponse()
	headers = [k + ": " + v for (k, v) in response.getheaders()
                   if k.startswith("BingAPIs-") or k.startswith("X-MSEdge-")]
	return headers, response.read().decode("utf8")

if len(subscriptionKey) == 32:

    print('Searching the Web for: ', term)
    
    headers, result = BingWebSearch(term)
    print("\nRelevant HTTP Headers:\n")
    print("\n".join(headers))
    print("\nJSON Response:\n")
    print(json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=4))

else:
    
    print("Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!")
    print("Please paste yours into the source code.")
```

**Response**

A sample response follows. To limit the length of the JSON, only a single result is shown here.
