# Quickstart: Use PHP to call the Bing Web Search API  

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Web Search API and receive a JSON response in less than 10 minutes.  

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-web-search-quickstart-signup](../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-web-search-quickstart-signup.md)]

## Prerequisites

* [PHP 5.6.x](http://php.net/downloads.php) or later  

## Make a call to the Bing Web Search API  

To run this application, follow these steps.

1. Make sure secure HTTP support is enabled in your `php.ini` as described in the code comment. On Windows, this file is in `C:\windows`.  
2. Create a new PHP project in your favorite IDE or editor.  
3. Copy this sample code into your project:  
    ```php
    <?php

    // NOTE: Be sure to uncomment the following line in your php.ini file.
    // ;extension=php_openssl.dll

    // **********************************************
    // *** Update or verify the following values. ***
    // **********************************************

    // Replace the accessKey string value with your valid access key.
    $accessKey = 'enter key here';

    // Verify the endpoint URI.  At this writing, only one endpoint is used for Bing
    // search APIs.  In the future, regional endpoints may be available.  If you
    // encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check this value against
    // the endpoint for your Bing Web search instance in your Azure dashboard.
    $endpoint = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/search';

    $term = 'Microsoft Cognitive Services';

    function BingWebSearch ($url, $key, $query) {
        // Prepare HTTP request
        // NOTE: Use the key 'http' even if you are making an HTTPS request. See:
        // http://php.net/manual/en/function.stream-context-create.php
        $headers = "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: $key\r\n";
        $options = array ('http' => array (
                              'header' => $headers,
                               'method' => 'GET'));

        // Perform the Web request and get the JSON response
        $context = stream_context_create($options);
        $result = file_get_contents($url . "?q=" . urlencode($query), false, $context);

        // Extract Bing HTTP headers
        $headers = array();
        foreach ($http_response_header as $k => $v) {
            $h = explode(":", $v, 2);
            if (isset($h[1]))
                if (preg_match("/^BingAPIs-/", $h[0]) || preg_match("/^X-MSEdge-/", $h[0]))
                    $headers[trim($h[0])] = trim($h[1]);
        }

        return array($headers, $result);
    }

    if (strlen($accessKey) == 32) {

        print "Searching the Web for: " . $term . "\n";

        list($headers, $json) = BingWebSearch($endpoint, $accessKey, $term);

        print "\nRelevant Headers:\n\n";
        foreach ($headers as $k => $v) {
            print $k . ": " . $v . "\n";
        }

        print "\nJSON Response:\n\n";
        echo json_encode(json_decode($json), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);

    } else {

        print("Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!\n");
        print("Please paste yours into the source code.\n");

    }
    ?>
    ```  
4. Replace the `accessKey` value with an access key valid for your subscription.  
5. Run the program. For example: `php your_program.php`.  

## Sample response

Responses from the Bing Web Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
