# Bing Web Search SDK preview
The Bing Search SDKs make web search functionality readily accessible in the following programming languages:
* [.NET samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-dotnet-sdk-samples/tree/master/BingSearchv7)
    The code samples include search scenarios for web pages, news, images, entities, videos, as well as custom searches and spell check.
    * See the [.NET libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/) for dependencies.
* [NodeJS samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples)
    The code samples include the same search scenarios as the .NET samples. 
    * See the [NodeJS libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/) for dependencies.
* [Java samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-java-sdk-samples)
    * See the [Java libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/) for dependencies.
* [Python samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples)
    * See the [Python libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/) for dependencies.

SDK samples for each language include a ReadMe file with details about installing and running the samples.
