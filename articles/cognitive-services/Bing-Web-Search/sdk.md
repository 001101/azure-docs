# Bing Web Search SDK preview
The Bing Search SDKs make web search functionality readily accessible in the following programming languages:
* The [.NET samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-dotnet-sdk-samples/tree/master/BingSearchv7) include search scenarios that: 1. Use a single word query `Xbox` and print out name and url for first web, image, news and videos results; 2. Query on `Best restaurants in Seattle`, verify number of results and print out name and url of first result; 3. Query on Microsoft with response filters to news and print details of news; 4. Query on Lady Gaga with `answerCount` and `promote` parameters then print details of answers.
    * See the [.NET libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/) for NuGet package dependencies.
* [NodeJS samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples) The NOdeJS code samples include the same search scenarios as the .NET samples. 
    * See the [NodeJS libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/) for dependencies.
* [Java samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-java-sdk-samples) Same scenarios as previous samples.
    * See the [Java libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/) for dependencies.
* [Python samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples) Same scenarios as previous samples.
    * See the [Python libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/) for dependencies.

SDK samples for each language include a ReadMe file with details about installing and running the samples.
