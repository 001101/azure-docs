# Quickstart: Summary

These quickstarts provide information and code samples to help you quickly get started using the Translator Text API to accomplish the following tasks:

* Translate source text from one language to another
* Convert text in one language from one script to another script
* Identify the language of the source text
* Get alternate translations for a word and examples of how to use it in context
* Break the source text into sentences
* Get supported languages

The code in each sample is similar, but they highlight different Translator Text features.
