# Workspace

A workspace is a work area for composing and building your custom translation system. A workspace can contain multiple projects, models, and documents. All the work you do in Custom Translator is inside a specific workspace.

Workspace is private to you and the people you invite into your workspace. Uninvited people do not have access to the content of your workspace. You can invite as many people as you like into your workspace and modify or remove their access anytime. You can also create a new workspace. By default a workspace will not contain any projects or documents that are within your other workspaces.
