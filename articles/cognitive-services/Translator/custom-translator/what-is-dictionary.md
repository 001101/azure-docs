# What is a dictionary?

A dictionary is an aligned pair of documents that specifies a list of phrases or sentences and their corresponding translations. Use a dictionary in your training, when you want Microsoft Translator to always translate any instances of the source phrase or sentence, using the translation you've provided in the dictionary. Dictionaries are sometimes called glossaries or term bases. You can think of the dictionary as a brute force “copy and replace” for all the terms you list. Furthermore, Microsoft Custom Translator service builds and makes use of its own general purpose dictionaries to improve the quality of its translation. However, a customer provided dictionary takes precedent and will be searched first to lookup words or sentences.

Dictionaries only work for projects in language pairs that have a fully supported Microsoft neural machine translation (NMT) system behind them. [View the complete list of languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/language-support#customization).

## Phrase dictionary
When you include a phrase dictionary in training your model, any word or phrase listed is translated in the way you specified. The rest of the sentence is translated as usual. You can use a phrase dictionary to specify phrases that shouldn't be translated by providing the same untranslated phrase in the source and target file in the dictionary.

## Sentence dictionary
The sentence dictionary allows you to specify an exact target translation for a source sentence. For a sentence dictionary match to occur, the entire submitted sentence must match the source dictionary entry.  If only a portion of the sentence matches, the entry won't match.  When a match is detected, the target entry of the sentence dictionary will be returned.

## Dictionary-only trainings
You can train a model using only dictionary data. To do this, select only the dictionary document (or multiple dictionary documents) that you wish to include and tap Create model. Since this is a dictionary-only training, there is no minimum number of training sentences required. Your model will typically complete training much faster than a standard training.  The resulting models will use the Microsoft baseline models for translation with the addition of the dictionaries you have added.  You will not get a test report.

>[!Note]
>Custom Translator does not sentence align dictionary files, so it is important that there are an equal number of source and target phrases/sentences in your dictionary documents and that they are precisely aligned.

## Recommendations

- Dictionaries are not substitutes for a trained model with training data.  Dictionaries essentially find and replace operation for words or sentences.  Accordingly, it is best practices to let the system learn from your training data in full sentences. However, when common phrases, i.e, more than one common word (aka compound nouns - see examples below), or sentences that must be rendered as-is, using a dictionary - in general - is the right choice.
- The phrase dictionary should be used sparingly. So, be aware that when a phrase within a sentence is replaced, the context within that sentence is lost or limited for translating the rest of the sentence. The result is that while the phrase or word within the sentence will translate according to the provided dictionary, the overall translation quality of the sentence will often suffer.
- The phrase dictionary works well for compound nouns like product names (“Microsoft SQL Server”), proper names (“City of Hamburg”), or features of the product (“pivot table”). It does not work equally well for verbs or adjectives because these are typically highly inflected in the source or in the target language. Best practices is to avoid phrase dictionary entries for anything but compound nouns.
- When using a dictionary, capitalization and punctuation in your source dictionary file will reflect the capitalization and punctuation provided in your target file (a 1:1 mapping), hence, influence the outcome when the system tries to identify a match between your input sentence and the source sentences in your dictionary file. For example, let’s say you trained an English to Spanish system that uses a dictionary that specifies “hello” in the source file to be translated to “buenos dias” in the target file, and the general purpose dictionary provided by Microsoft contains entry to translate "Hello" to "Hola." When you request translation of a sentence that includes the phrase “hello”, the system will lookup inside your dictionary and would find the "hello" entry, thus, “buenos dias” would be returned in the final translation. While on the other hand, specifying "Hello" which does not exist in your dictionary, a match would not be found in your dictionary and "Hola" from the general purpose dictionary would be returned.
- If a word appears more than once in a dictionary file, the system will always use the last entry provided. Hence, your dictionary should not contain multiple translations of the same word.
