# Training and Model

A model is the system, which provides translation for a specific language pair.
The outcome of a successful training is a model. When training a model, three
mutually exclusive data sets are required: training data, tuning data, and
testing data. Dictionary data can also be provided. 

If only training data is
provided when queuing a training, Custom Translator will automatically assemble tuning and testing datasets. It will exclude 5,000 sentences from your training data and use 2,500 each to assemble a tuning and testing sets.
