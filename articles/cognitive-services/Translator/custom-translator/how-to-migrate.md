# Manage settings

You can migrate your Microsoft Translator Hub workspace and projects to Custom Translator. Migration starts from Hub.


Following items are migrated during the process:

1.	The Project(s) definitions.

2.	The Training definition will be used to create a new model definition on Custom Translator.

3.	The Parallel and Monolingual files used within the trainings will all be migrated as new Documents in Custom Translator.

4.	The auto-generated System Test and Tuning data will be exported and created as new Documents in Custom Translator.

For all deployed trainings, Custom Translator will train the model without any cost. You have the option manually deploy them.

For all successful trainings, which are not deployed, they will be migrated as draft in Custom Translator.
