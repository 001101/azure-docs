# Configure Translator Text docker containers

Translator Text provides each container with a common configuration framework, so that you can easily configure and manage storage, logging and telemetry, and security settings for your containers.

## Configuration settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration settings table](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-table.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [`ApiKey`](#apikey-configuration-setting), [`Billing`](#billing-configuration-setting), and [`Eula`](#eula-setting) settings are used together, and you must provide valid values for all three of them; otherwise, your container won't start. For more information about using these configuration settings to instantiate a container, see [Billing](how-to-install-containers.md#billing).

## ApiKey configuration setting

The `ApiKey` setting specifies the Azure resource key used to track billing information for the container. You must specify a value for the ApiKey and the value must be a valid key for the _Translator Text_ resource specified for the [`Billing`](#billing-configuration-setting) configuration setting.

This setting can be found in the following place:

* Azure portal: **Translator Text** resource management, under **Keys**

## ApplicationInsights setting

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration ApplicationInsights settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-application-insights.md)]

## Billing configuration setting

The `Billing` setting specifies the endpoint URI of the _Translator Text_ resource on Azure used to meter billing information for the container. You must specify a value for this configuration setting, and the value must be a valid endpoint URI for a _Translator Text_ resource on Azure. The container reports usage about every 10 to 15 minutes.

This setting can be found in the following place:

* Azure portal: **Translator Text** Overview, labeled `Endpoint`

|Required| Name | Data type | Description |
|--|------|-----------|-------------|
|Yes| `Billing` | String | The required billing endpoint URI |

## Eula setting

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration eula settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-eula.md)]

## Fluentd settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration fluentd settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-fluentd.md)]

## HTTP proxy credentials settings

[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration fluentd settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-http-proxy.md)]

## Logging settings
 
[!INCLUDE [Container shared configuration logging settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-configuration-shared-settings-logging.md)]

## Mount settings

Use bind mounts to read and write data to and from the container. You can specify an input mount or output mount by specifying the `--mount` option in the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command.

The Translator Text containers don't use input or output mounts to store training or service data. 

The exact syntax of the host mount location varies, depending on the host operating system. Additionally, the [host computer](how-to-install-containers.md#the-host-computer)'s mount location may not be accessible due to a conflict between permissions used by the docker service account and the host mount location permissions. 

|Optional| Name | Data type | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
|Not allowed| `Input` | String | Translator Text containers do not use this.|
|Optional| `Output` | String | The target of the output mount. The default value is `/output`. This is the location of the logs. This includes container logs. <br><br>Example:<br>`--mount type=bind,src=c:\output,target=/output`|

## Example docker run commands 

The following examples use the configuration settings to illustrate how to write and use `docker run` commands.  Once running, the container continues to run until you [stop](how-to-install-containers.md#stop-the-container) it.

* **Line-continuation character**: The docker commands in the following sections use the back slash, `\`, as a line continuation character. Replace or remove this based on your host operating system's requirements. 
* **Argument order**: Do not change the order of the arguments unless you are very familiar with docker containers.

Replace {_argument_name_} with your own values:

| Placeholder | Value | Format or example |
|-------------|-------|---|
| **{API_KEY}** | The endpoint key of the `Translator Text` resource available on the Azure `Translator Text` Keys page. |`xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`|
| **{ENDPOINT_URI}** | The billing endpoint value is available on the Azure `Translator Text` Overview page.| See [gathering required parameters](how-to-install-containers.md#gathering-required-parameters) for explicit examples. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Eula`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey` options must be specified to run the container; otherwise, the container won't start.  For more information, see [Billing](how-to-install-containers.md#billing).
> The ApiKey value is the **Key** from the Azure `Translator Text` Resource keys page. 

## Translator Text container docker examples

The following docker examples are for the Translator Text container.

### Basic example

```
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:80 --memory 4g --cpus 4 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-translator-text \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

### Logging example

```
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:80 --memory 4g --cpus 4 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-translator-text \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY} \
Logging:Console:LogLevel:Default=Information
```
