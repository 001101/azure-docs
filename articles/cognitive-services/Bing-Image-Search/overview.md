# What is Bing Image Search?

The Bing Image Search API enables you to develop intelligent apps that leverage Bing's cognitive image service. By sending user search queries with the API, you can get relevant image-specific results similar to [Bing Images](https://www.bing.com/images).

Be aware that the Bing Image Search API provides image-only search results. Use the [Bing Web Search API](../bing-web-search/search-the-web.md), [Video Search API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/Bing-Video-Search) and [News Search API](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search) for other types of web content. 

## Bing Image Search Capabilities

While Bing Image Search primarily finds and returns relevant images from a search query, the service also provides features to filter images, and suggest additional queries.  


| Feature                         | Description |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Suggesting & using search terms | Improve your app experience by using the [Bing Autosuggest API](../bing-autosuggest/get-suggested-search-terms.md) to display suggested search terms in real time.|
| Getting images from Bing         | Take a search query and use the Bing Image Search API to get relevant images. |
| Filtering image results         | Filter the images that Bing returns by editing query parameters.           |
| Displaying thumbnails           | Display thumbnail previews for the images returned by Bing Image Search. |  
| Pivoting the Query              | Display optional search terms to the user based on their original search query.        |
| Expanding the Query             | Expand your search capabilities by including Bing-suggested search-terms in queries.|

## Next steps

To get started quickly with your first request, see [the C# quickstart](quickstarts/csharp.md).

Familiarize yourself with the [Bing Image Search API v7](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference) reference. The reference contains the list of endpoints, headers, and query parameters that you'd use to request search results. It also includes definitions of the response objects.

To improve your search box user experience, see [Bing Autosuggest API](../bing-autosuggest/get-suggested-search-terms.md). As the user enters their query term, you can call this API to get relevant query terms that were used by others.

Be sure to read [Bing Use and Display Requirements](./useanddisplayrequirements.md) so you don't break any of the rules about using the search results.

When you call the Bing Image Search API, Bing returns a list of results. The list is a subset of the total number of results that are relevant to the query. The response's `totalEstimatedMatches` field contains an estimate of the number of images that are available to view. For details about how you'd page through the remaining images, see [Paging Images](./paging-images.md).
