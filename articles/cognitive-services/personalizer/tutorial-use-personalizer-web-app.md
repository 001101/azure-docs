# Add Personalizer to a .NET web app

Customize a C# .NET web app with a Personalizer loop to provide the correct content to a user based on actions (with features) and context features.

**In this tutorial, you learn how to:**

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up Personalizer key and endpoint
> * Collect features
> * Call Rank API
> * Display top action, designated as _rewardActionId_

## Select the best content for a web app

A web app should use Personalizer when there is an _action_ (some type of content) on the web page that needs to be personalized to a single top item (rewardActionId) to display. Examples of action lists include news articles, button placement locations, and word choices for product names.

You send the list to the Personalizer loop, Personalizer selects the single best content, then your web app displays that content.

In this tutorial, the actions are types of food:

* pasta
* ice cream
* juice
* salad

To help Personalizer learn about your actions, send both action features and context features with each Rank API request.

A **feature** is information about the action or context that can be aggregated (grouped) across members of your web app user base. A feature _isn't_ individually specific (such as a user ID) or highly specific (such as an exact time of day).

### Actions with features

Each action (content item) has features to help distinguish the food item:

* taste - such as salty or sweet
* spiceLevel - none, low, medium
* nutritionLevel - a number within a range such as 1-10

The features aren't configured as part of the loop configuration in the Azure portal. Instead they are sent as a JSON object with each Rank API call. This allows flexibility for the actions and their features to grow, change, and shrink over time, which allows Personalizer to follow trends.

```json
"actions": [
    {
      "id": "pasta",
      "features": [
        {
          "taste": "salty",
          "spiceLevel": "medium"
        },
        {
          "nutritionLevel": 5,
          "cuisine": "italian"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "ice cream",
      "features": [
        {
          "taste": "sweet",
          "spiceLevel": "none"
        },
        {
          "nutritionalLevel": 2
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "juice",
      "features": [
        {
          "taste": "sweet",
          "spiceLevel": "none"
        },
        {
          "nutritionLevel": 5
        },
        {
          "drink": true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "salad",
      "features": [
        {
          "taste": "salty",
          "spiceLevel": "low"
        },
        {
          "nutritionLevel": 8
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

## Context features

Context features help Personalizer understand the context of the actions. The context for this sample application includes:

* time of day - morning, afternoon, evening, night
* user's preference for taste - salty or sweet
* browser's context - user agent, geographical location, referrer

## Download the working sample

In this tutorial, the complete sample web app is provided for you.

1. Download the [GitHub samples repository](git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-personalizer-samples.git) for Personalizer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-personalizer-samples.git
    ```

    This sample is found within the `/samples/HttpRequestFeatures` folder. Use Visual Studio 2019 to open the solution, `HttpRequestFeatures.sln`.

## Create a Personalizer resource in the Azure portal

Use either the [Azure portal](how-to-create-resource.md#create-a-resource-in-the-azure-portal) or the [Azure CLI](how-to-create-resource.md#create-a-resource-with-the-azure-cli) to create a Personalizer resource. The Personalizer resource also known as a Personalizer _loop_.

The resource has 2 values you need in order to use the loop:

* Endpoint - an example is: ``
* Key

## Configure the web app with your Personalizer endpoint

and search for

Using best security practices, the endpoint is stored in the `appsetings.json` file.
