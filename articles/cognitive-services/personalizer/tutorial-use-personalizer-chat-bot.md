# Tutorial: Use Personalizer in .NET chat bot

Use a C# .NET chat bot with a Personalizer loop to provide the correct content to a user based on actions (with features) and context features.

This chat bot suggests a specific coffee or tea to a user. The user can accept or reject that suggestion. This gives Personalizer information to help make the next suggestion.

**In this tutorial, you learn how to:**

<!-- green checkmark -->
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up Personalizer key and endpoint
> * Collect features
> * Call Rank and Reward APIs
> * Display top action, designated as _rewardActionId_

## Install required software
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

## Download the sample code of the chat bot

The chat bot is available in the Personalizer samples repository. Clone the repository, then open the sample in the `/samples/ChatbotExample` directory with Visual Studio 2019.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-personalizer-samples.git
```

## Create and configure Personalizer and LUIS resources

### Create Azure resources

To use this chat bot, you need to create Azure resources for Personalizer and Language Understanding (LUIS).

* [Create LUIS resources](../luis/luis-how-to-azure-subscription.md#create-luis-resources-in-azure-portal). Select **both** in the creation step because you need both an authoring and prediction resources.
* [Create Personalizer resource](how-to-create-resource.md) then copy the key and endpoint from the Azure portal. You will need to set these values in the `appsettings.json` file of the .NET project.

### Create LUIS app

If you are new to LUIS, you need to [sign in](https://www.luis.ai) and immediately migrate your account. You don't need to create new resources, instead select the resources you created in the previous section of this tutorial.

1. To create a new LUIS application, in the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai), select your subscription and authoring resource.
1. Then, still on the same page, select **+ New app for conversation**, then **Import as JSON**.
1. In the pop-up dialog, select **Choose file** then select the `/samples/ChatbotExample/CognitiveModels/coffeebot.json` file. Enter the name `Personalizer Coffee bot`.
1. Select the **Train** button in the top right navigation of the LUIS portal.
1. Select the **Publish** button to publish the app to the **Production slot** for the prediction runtime.
1. Select **Manage**, then **Settings**. Copy the value of the **App ID**. You will need to set this value in the `appsettings.json` file of the .NET project.
1. Still in the **Manage** section, select **Azure Resources**. This displays the associated resources on the app.
1. Select **Add prediction resource**. In the pop-up dialog, select your subscription, and the prediction resource created in a previous section of this tutorial, then select **Done**.
1. Copy the values of the **Primary key** and **Endpoint URL**. You will need to set these values in the `appsettings.json` file of the .NET project.

### Set values in appsettings.json file

1. Open the chat bot solution file, `ChatbotSamples.sln`, with Visual Studio 2019.
1. Open `appsettings.json` in the root directory of the project.
1. Set all 5 settings copied in the previous section of this tutorial.

    ```json
    {
      "PersonalizerChatbot": {
        "LuisAppId": "",
        "LuisAPIKey": "",
        "LuisServiceEndpoint": "",
        "PersonalizerServiceEndpoint": "",
        "PersonalizerAPIKey": ""
      }
    }
    ```

### Build and run the bot

Once you have configured the `appsettings.json`, you are ready to build and run the chat bot. When you do, a browser opens to the running website, `http://localhost:3978`.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-chat-bot/chat-bot-web-site.png" alt-text="Screenshot of browser displaying chat bot web site.":::

Keep the web site running because the tutorial explains what the bot is doing, so you can interact with the bot.

## How does the chat bot work?

A chat bot is typically a back-and-forth conversation with a user. This specific chat bot uses Personalizer to select the best action (coffee or tea) to offer the user. Personalizer uses reinforcement learning to make that selection.

The chat bot needs to manage turns in conversation. The chat bot uses [Bot Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk) to manage the bot architecture and conversation and uses the Cognitive Service, [Language Understanding](../LUIS/index.yml) (LUIS), to understand the intent of the natural language from the user.

The chat bot is a web site with a specific route available to answer requests, `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`. You can use the bot emulator to visually interact with the running chat bot while you are developing a bot locally.

### User interactions with the bot

This is a simple chat bot which allows you to enter text queries.

|User enters text|Bot responds with text|Description of action bot takes to determine response text|
|--|--|--|
|No text entered - bot begins the conversation.|`This is a simple chatbot example that illustrates how to use Personalizer. The bot learns what coffee or tea order is preferred by customers given some context information (such as weather, temperature, and day of the week) and information about the user.`<br>`To use the bot, just follow the prompts. To try out a new imaginary context, type “Reset” and a new one will be randomly generated.`<br>`Welcome to the coffee bot, please tell me if you want to see the menu or get a coffee or tea suggestion for today. Once I’ve given you a suggestion, you can reply with ‘like’ or ‘don’t like’. It’s Tuesday today and the weather is Snowy.`|The bot begins the conversation with instructional text and lets you know what the context is: `Tuesday`, `Snowy`.|
|`Show menu`|`Here is our menu: Coffee: Cappuccino Espresso Latte Macchiato Mocha Tea: GreenTea Rooibos`|Determine intent of query using LUIS, then display menu choices of coffee and tea items. Features of the actions are |
|`What do you suggest`|`How about Latte?`|Determine intent of query using LUIS, then call **Rank API**, and display top choice as a question `How about {response.RewardActionId}?`. Also displays JSON call and response for illustration purposes.|
|`I like it`|`That’s great! I’ll keep learning your preferences over time.`<br>`Would you like to get a new suggestion or reset the simulated context to a new day?`|Determine intent of query using LUIS, then call **Reward API** with reward of `1`, displays JSON call and response for illustration purposes.|
|`I don't like it`|`Oh well, maybe I’ll guess better next time.`<br>`Would you like to get a new suggestion or reset the simulated context to a new day?`|Determine intent of query using LUIS, then call **Reward API** with reward of `0`, displays JSON call and response for illustration purposes.|
|`Reset`|Returns instructional text.|Determine intent of query using LUIS, then displays the instructional text and resets the context.|

### Use bot for demonstration only

There are a few cautions to note about this conversation:
* **Bot interaction**: The conversation is very simple because it is demonstrating Rank and Reward in a simple use case. It is not demonstrating the full functionality of the Bot Framework SDK or of the Emulator.
* **Personalizer**: The features are selected randomly to simulate usage. Do not randomize features in a production Personalizer scenario.
* **Language Understanding (LUIS)**: The few example utterances of the LUIS model are meant for this sample only. Do not use so few example utterances in your production LUIS application.

## Personalizer in a chat bot

This chat bot uses Personalizer to select the top action (specific coffee or tea), based on a list of _actions_ (some type of content) and context features.

You send the list of actions, along with context features, to the Personalizer loop. Personalizer selects the single best action, then your chat bot displays that action.

In this tutorial, the **actions** are types of coffee and tea:

* Coffee
    * Cappuccino
    * Espresso
    * Latte
    * Macchiato
    * Mocha
* Tea
    * GreenTea
    * Rooibos

**Rank API:** To help Personalizer learn about your actions, the bot sends the following with each Rank API request:

* Actions _with features_
* Context features

A **feature** of the model is information about the action or context that can be aggregated (grouped) across members of your chat bot user base. A feature _isn't_ individually specific (such as a user ID) or highly specific (such as an exact time of day).

Features are used to align actions to the current context in the model. The model is a representation of Personalizer's past knowledge about actions, context, and their features that allows it to make educated decisions.

The model, including features, is updated on a schedule based on your **Model update frequency** setting in the Azure portal.

Features should be selected with the same planning and design that you would apply to any schema or model in your technical architecture. The feature values can be set with business logic or third-party systems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Features in this application are for demonstration and may not necessarily be the best features to use in a your web app for your use case.

### Action features

Each action (content item) has features to help distinguish the coffee or tea item.

The features aren't configured as part of the loop configuration in the Azure portal. Instead they are sent as a JSON object with each Rank API call. This allows flexibility for the actions and their features to grow, change, and shrink over time, which allows Personalizer to follow trends.

Features for coffee and tea include:

* Origin location of coffee bean such as Kenya and Brazil
* Is the coffee or tea organic?
* Light or dark roast of coffee

While the coffee has three features in the preceding list, tea only has one. Only pass features to Personalizer that make sense to the action. Don't pass in an empty value for a feature if it doesn't apply to the action.

### Context features

Context features help Personalizer understand the context of the environment such as the display device, the user, the location, and other features your system knows about the environment that are relevant to your use case.

The context for this chat bot includes:

* Type of weather (snowy, rainy, sunny)
* Day of the week

Selection of features is randomized in this chat bot. In a real bot, use real data for your context features.

## Demonstrate the Personalizer loop

1. Select the **Generate new Rank Request** button to create a new JSON object for the Rank API call. This creates the actions (with features) and context features and displays the values so you can see what the JSON looks like.

    For your own future application, generation of actions and features may happen on the client, on the server, a mix of the two, or with calls to other services.

1. Select **Send Rank Request** to send the JSON object to the server. The server calls the Personalizer Rank API. The server receives the response and returns the top ranked action to the client to display.

1. Set the reward value, then select the **Send Reward Request** button. If you don't change the reward value, the client application always sends the value of `1` to Personalizer.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Build and run the HTTPRequestFeaturesExample project. A browser window opens to display the single page application.](./media/tutorial-web-app/reward-score-api-call.png)

    For your own future application, generation of the reward score may happen after collecting information from the user's behavior on the client, along with business logic on the server.

## Understand the sample web app

The sample web app has a **C# .NET** server, which manages the collection of features and sending and receiving HTTP calls to your Personalizer endpoint.

The sample web app uses a **knockout front-end client application** to capture features and process user interface actions such as clicking on buttons, and sending data to the .NET server.

The following sections explain the parts of the server and client that a developer needs to understand to use Personalizer.

## Rank API: Client application sends context to server

The client application collects the user's browser _user agent_.

> ![Build and run the HTTPRequestFeaturesExample project. A browser window opens to display the single page application.](./media/tutorial-web-app/user-agent.png)

## Rank API: Server application calls Personalizer

This is a typical .NET web app with a client application, much of the boiler plate code is provided for you. Any code not specific to Personalizer is removed from the following code snippets so you can focus on the Personalizer-specific code.

### Create Personalizer client

In the server's **Startup.cs**, the Personalizer endpoint and key are used to create the Personalizer client. The client application doesn't need to communicate with Personalizer in this app, instead relying on the server to make those SDK calls.

The web server's .NET start-up code is:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Personalizer;
// ... other using statements removed for brevity

namespace HttpRequestFeaturesExample
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            string personalizerApiKey = Configuration.GetSection("PersonalizerApiKey").Value;
            string personalizerEndpoint = Configuration.GetSection("PersonalizerConfiguration:ServiceEndpoint").Value;
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(personalizerEndpoint) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(personalizerApiKey))
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("Missing Azure Personalizer endpoint and/or api key.");
            }
            services.AddSingleton(client =>
            {
                return new PersonalizerClient(new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials(personalizerApiKey))
                {
                    Endpoint = personalizerEndpoint
                };
            });

            services.AddMvc();
        }

        // ... code removed for brevity
    }
}
```

### Select best action

In the server's **PersonalizerController.cs**, the **GenerateRank** server API summarizes the preparation to call the Rank API

* Create new `eventId` for the Rank call
* Get the list of actions
* Get the list of features from the user and create context features
* Optionally, set any excluded actions
* Call Rank API, return results to client

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Creates a RankRequest with user time of day, HTTP request features,
/// and taste as the context and several different foods as the actions
/// </summary>
/// <returns>RankRequest with user info</returns>
[HttpGet("GenerateRank")]
public RankRequest GenerateRank()
{
    string eventId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

    // Get the actions list to choose from personalizer with their features.
    IList<RankableAction> actions = GetActions();

    // Get context information from the user.
    HttpRequestFeatures httpRequestFeatures = GetHttpRequestFeaturesFromRequest(Request);
    string timeOfDayFeature = GetUsersTimeOfDay();
    string tasteFeature = GetUsersTastePreference();

    // Create current context from user specified data.
    IList<object> currentContext = new List<object>() {
            new { time = timeOfDayFeature },
            new { taste = tasteFeature },
            new { httpRequestFeatures }
    };

    // Exclude an action for personalizer ranking. This action will be held at its current position.
    IList<string> excludeActions = new List<string> { "juice" };

    // Rank the actions
    return new RankRequest(actions, currentContext, excludeActions, eventId);
}
```

The JSON sent to Personalizer, containing both actions (with features) and the current context features, looks like:

```json
{
    "contextFeatures": [
        {
            "time": "morning"

### Return Personalizer rewardActionId to client

The Rank API returns the selected best action **rewardActionId** to the server.

Display the action returned in **rewardActionId**.

```json
{
    "ranking": [
        {
            "id": "popcorn",
            "probability": 0.833333254
        },
        {
            "id": "salad",
            "probability": 0.03333333
        },
        {
            "id": "juice",
            "probability": 0
        },
        {
            "id": "soup",
            "probability": 0.03333333
        },
        {
            "id": "coffee",
            "probability": 0.03333333
        },
        {
            "id": "pasta",
            "probability": 0.03333333
        },
        {
            "id": "ice cream",
            "probability": 0.03333333
        }
    ],
    "eventId": "82ac52da-4077-4c7d-b14e-190530578e75",
    "rewardActionId": "popcorn"
}
```

### Client displays the rewardActionId action

In this tutorial, the `rewardActionId` value is displayed.

In your own future application, that may be some exact text, a button, or a section of the web page highlighted. The list is returned for any post-analysis of scores, not an ordering of the content. Only the `rewardActionId` content should be displayed.

## Reward API: collect information for reward

The [reward score](concept-rewards.md) should be carefully planned, just as the features are planned. The reward score typically should be a value from 0 to 1. The value _can_ be calculated partially in the client application, based on user behaviors, and partially on the server, based on business logic and goals.

If the server doesn't call the Reward API within the **Reward wait time** configured in the Azure portal for your Personalizer resource, then the **Default reward** (also configured in the Azure portal) is used for that event.

In this sample application, you can select a value to see how the reward impacts the selections.

## Additional ways to learn from this sample

The sample uses several time-based events configured in the Azure portal for your Personalizer resource. Play with those values then return to this sample web app to see how the changes impact the Rank and Reward calls:

* Reward wait time
* Model update frequency

Additional settings to play with include:
* Default reward
* Exploration percentage


## Clean up resources

When you are done with this tutorial, clean up the following resources:

* Delete your sample project directory.
* Delete your Personalizer resource - think of a Personalizer resource as dedicated to the actions and context - only reuse the resource if you are still using the foods as actions subject domain.


## Next steps
* [How Personalizer works](how-personalizer-works.md)
* [Features](concepts-features.md): learn concepts about features using with actions and context
* [Rewards](concept-rewards.md): learn about calculating rewards
