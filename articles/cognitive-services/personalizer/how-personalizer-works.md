# How Personalizer Works

## Introduction

Personalizer uses machine learning to discover what action to use in a context. Each learning loop has a model that is trained exclusively on data that you have sent to it via **Rank** and **Reward** calls. Every learning loop is completely independent of each other.

When calling **Rank**, the Personalizer service decides to use either:

* The current model to decide the best action based on past data.
* Or perform exploration.

When calling **Reward**, the Personalizer service:

* Collects data to train the model by recording the features and reward scores of each rank call.
* Uses that data to update the model, following machine learning parameters specified in the _Learning Policy_.


## Architecture

The following image shows the architectural flow of calling the Rank and Reward calls:

1. Personalizer uses an internal AI model to determine the rank of the action.
1. The service decides whether to exploit the current model or explore new choices for the model.  
1. The ranking result is sent to EventHub.
1. When Personalizer receives the reward, the reward is sent to EventHub. 
1. The rank and reward are correlated.
1. The AI model is updated based on the correlation results.
1. The inference engine is updated with the new model. 

## Research behind personalizer

Personalizer is based on cutting-edge science and research in the area of [Reinforcement Learning](concepts-reinforcement-learning.md) including papers, research activities, and ongoing areas of exploration in Microsoft Research.
