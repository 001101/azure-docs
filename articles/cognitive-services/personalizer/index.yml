abstract:
  description: Personalizer allows your application to choose the best experience to show to your users, learning from their real-time behavior. Your client application provides a list of possible actions, along with data about the context. Personalizer determines the best action to take. Once your client application uses the chosen action, it provides feedback to Personalizer, closing the feedback loop. Personalizer automatically updates its own model used for future ranks.
