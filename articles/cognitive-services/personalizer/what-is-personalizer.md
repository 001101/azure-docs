# What is Personalizer?

Azure Personalizer is a cloud-based API service that helps your client application choose the best _content_ to show each user. The service **ranks** your content, in real-time, based on information you provide. After you present the ranked content to your user, and your user selects from the content choices, return a **reward** to the Personalizer service indicating if the user selected the content Personalizer ranked highest, so it can continue to improve its ability to rank content.

**Content** can be any unit of information such as text, images, urls, or emails that you want to rank in order to show the top-ranked item to your user.

Personalizer is not a service:

* Requiring cleaned and labeled content
* To persist and manage user profile information
* To log individual users' preferences or history

## Personalizer content requirements

* You have content you want presented in a ranked order.
* You have information describing the content you want ranked: _actions_ and _context_ - explained below.
* You have enough real-time traffic (~XK transactions/day) to give to Personalizer to rank the content.

## How does Personalizer rank your content?

Personalizer uses reinforcement learning to rank information about your content:

* **Action features** - features of your content
* **Context features** - features of the context

You need to determine the information groups for action features and context features based on your scenario. Several example scenarios are:

|Content|**Action features**|**Context features**|
|--|--|--|
|News list|News type<br>Subject<br>Content type (text, image, video)|Device news is read from<br>Month, or season<br>|
|Movies list|Movie genre<br>Main actors<br>Directory<br>Film rating<br>length|Device movie is watched from<br>screen size<br>Month, or season<br>|
|Products list|Price<br>Size<br>Availability<br>Time to package<br>Time to ship<br>On Sale|Device shopping  is read from<br>Spending tier of user<br>Month, or season|

## Personalizer can rank content from a recommendation engine

Personalizer can be used _with_ your existing recommendation engine as a last-step ranker, selecting the _top_ choice of content, from the list of choices provided by the recommendation engine. Learn how to [use Personalizer with recommendation engines](where-can-you-use-personalizer.md#use-personalizer-with-recommendation-engines).

## When to call Personalizer

Personalizer's **Rank** [API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2092082) is called _every time_ you present content, in real-time. This is known as an **event**, noted with an _event ID_.

Personalizer's **Reward** API can be called in real-time or delayed to better fit your infrastructure. You determine the reward score based on your business needs. That can be a single value such as 1 for good, and 0 for bad, or an algorithm you create based on your business needs.

## How do you get started?

[architectural image]

1. Design and plan for content, **_actions_**, and **_context_**. Determine the reward algorithm for the **_reward_** score.
1. Each Personalizer Resource you create is considered 1 Learning Loop. The loop is the combination of both the Rank and Reward calls for each _event_.
1. Add Personalizer to your website or content system:
    1. Add a **Rank** call to Personalizer in your application, website, or system to determine the ranking of content before the content is shown to the user.
    1. Display ranked content to user.
    1. Collect information about how the user behaved when presented with the ranked content, such as:
        * Immediately selected top-ranked content
        * Or selected other content
        * Or paused, scrolling around indecisively, before selecting  content
    1. Add a **Reward** call
        * Immediately after showing your content
        * Or sometime later in an offline system
