# What is Project Monitoring? 

Metrics Monitoring is a scalable real-time time series monitoring, alerting, and root cause analysis platform.

![Gualala_overview](media/gualala_overview.png "Gualala Overview")

The Project "Gualala" is a new Cognitive Service that uses time series based decision AI to predict next maintenance cycle of various equipment and devices, identify and assist trouble shooting the incidents of online services, and monitor the business health by automating the slice and dice of business metrics like revenue, page viewsâ€¦ Project "Gualala" provides developers an out-of-box smart monitoring pipeline which makes it much easier to build an enterprise grade solution. Through a set of APIs handling data ingestion, anomaly detection, diagnostics and feedback, developers can maximize the productivity by focusing on business problems and user experience instead of knowledge machine learning, and sophisticated distributed data engineering.

Project "Gualala" makes it easy to ingest multi-dimensional metrics data from many data stores, orchestrate the model building & customization, identify anomalies, correlate them, and build root cause analysis in an automatic and scalable way. The key capabilities are exposed through RESTful APIs (application programming interfaces) and developers can easily build solutions without the heavy lifting of data engineering and building ML (Machine Learning) pipeline. This would significantly reduce the cost of building a solution and reduce the customer's time to market.
