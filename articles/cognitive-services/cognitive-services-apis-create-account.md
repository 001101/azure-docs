# Create and access a Cognitive Services API resource in the Azure portal

Before accessing Azure Cognitive Services, you must create and subscribe to at least one Cognitive Services [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal). These resources enable you to connect to one or more of the many Cognitive Services APIs available. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) for free. Note that transaction limits and pricing varies between APIs.  

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com), and click **+ Create a resource**.

2. Under Azure Marketplace, select **AI + Machine Learning**. If you don't see the API you're interested in, click on **See all** to view the entire catalog of Cognitive Services APIs.

3. On the **Create** page, provide the following information:

|    |    |
|--|--|
| **Name** | A descriptive name for your cognitive services resource. We recommend using a descriptive name, for example *MyNameFaceAPIAccount*. |
| **Subscription:** | Select one of your available Azure subscriptions. |
| **Pricing tier:** | The cost of your Cognitive Services account depends on the options you choose and your usage. For more information, see the API [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/).
| **Resource Group Location:** | This is required only if the API selected is global (not bound to a location). If the API is global and not bound to a location, however, you must specify a location for the resource group where the metadata associated with the Cognitive Services API account resides. This location has no impact on the runtime availability of your account. |

4. Click **Create** to create the account.

If you pinned the resource to the Azure dashboard, select the tile. Otherwise, you can find it in **Resource Groups**.

Within your Cognitive Services resource, You can use the Endpoint URL and keys in the **Overview** section to start making API calls in your applications.
