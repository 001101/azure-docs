# Cognitive Services and Machine learning

Cognitive Services provided machine learning to solve general problems such as analyzing text for emotional sentiment or analyzing images to recognize objects or faces. You shouldn't need special machine learning or data science knowledge to use these services. These services are provided with REST APIs and SDK packages. 

Machine learning is a platform where you bring together data and a machine learning algorithm to meet a very specific need. You will need a high degree of machine-learning or data-science knowledge.

|Data science expertise|Machine learning|

As the Azure service offering grows, many services will offer easy Cognitive Service integration. Cognitive Search is one example of this. 

Cognitive Services and machine learning services are not mutually exclusive. A machine learning project can use Cognitive Services.
