# Cognitive Services and Machine learning

Cognitive Services provides machine learning to solve general problems such as analyzing text for emotional sentiment or analyzing images to recognize objects or faces. You shouldn't need special machine learning or data science knowledge to use these services. 

## What is machine learning?

Machine learning is a platform where you bring together data and an algorithm to solve a specific need. Once the data and algorithm are trained, the output is a model that you can use again with different data. The new data will produce a similar outcome. 

The process of building a machine learning system requires a high degree of machine-learning or data-science knowledge.

## What is a Cognitive Service?

A Cognitive Service is a service that provides part or all of the machine learning: data, algorithm, or trained model. The list of services includes fully-trained models you can use with your own data, as well as customizable models you bring your data to train. 

These services are meant to require general data knowledge without having to know a high-degree of machine-learning or data-science. These services provide both REST and language-based SDKs. These services require programming language knowledge to use the model.

## A fully-trained model is a black box 

Services that provide a fully-trained model can be treated as a black box. You don't need to know how they work or what data was used to train them. You bring your data to a fully-trained model to get a prediction. The following table lists some examples of a fully-trained model. 

|Fully-trained service|Your data sent to trained model|Service Output|
|--|--|--|
|Text Analytics - Sentiment analysis|Your own text.|Sentiment value of positive, negative, or neutral.|
|Computer vision|Your image.|Information about what is in the image.|

## Train with your own data 

Some services allow you to bring your own data, then train a model. This allows you to train using the Service's algorithm with your own data. The output matches your needs. When you bring your own data, you may need to tag the data in a way specific to the service. For example, if you are training a model to identify flowers, you can provide a catalog of flower images along with the location of the flower in each image to train the model. 

The following table lists some examples of this type of service:

|Service|Training data|Your data sent to trained model|Service Output|
|--|--|--|--|
|Custom Vision|Catalog of images with optional tag locations inside each image|New image|Classification of new image.|
|Language Understanding|Catalog of example user utterances tagged with intents and entities|New utterance|Classification of new utterance.|
