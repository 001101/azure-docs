## Get the training and prediction keys

The project needs a valid set of subscription keys to interact with the service. You can find the items at the  [Custom Vision website](https://customvision.ai). Sign in with the account associated with the Azure account used to create your Custom Vision resources. On the home page (the page with the option to add a new project), select the __gear icon__ in the upper right. Find your training and prediction resources in the list and expand them. Here you can find your __Training Key__,  __Prediction Key__, and __Prediction Resource Id__ values. Save these to a temporary location.

Alternatively, you can obtain these keys and ID from the [Azure Portal](https://www.portal.azure.com) by viewing your Custom Vision Training and Prediction resources and navigating to the __Keys__ tab. There you can find your __Training Key__ and  __Prediction Key__. Navigate to the __Properties__ tab of your Prediction resource to obtain your __Prediction Resource Id__.
