# Limits and Quotas

There are three tiers of keys for Custom Vision Service. F0 and S0 resources are obtained via the Azure Portal. See the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) for details on pricing and transaction definitions. F0 projects can be upgraded to S0 projects.

Limited Trial project resources are attached to your Custom Vision login (ie an AAD account or MSA account.) They are intended to be used for short trials of the service.  Accounts created during early free preview, prior to the introduction of Azure previews (March 1, 2018) will retain their previous quotas for Limited Trials.
