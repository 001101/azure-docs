# Encryption of data at rest with customer-managed keys for the Face service

The Face service supports encryption of data at rest with customer-managed keys (CMK), also known as Bring your own key (BYOK). The Face service provides encryption of data at rest and in transit. By default, the Face service uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt the data. With CMK support, customers now have the choice of encrypting the data at rest with a key encryption key, managed by the customers, using the [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/).
