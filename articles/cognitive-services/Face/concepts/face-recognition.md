**Question**: What factors can reduce Face API's accuracy for Recognition, Verification, or Find Similar?

**Answer**: Generally it is the same cases where humans have difficulty identifying someone including:
* Obstructions blocking one or both eyes
* Harsh lighting (for example, severe backlighting)
* Changes to hair style or facial hair
* Changes due to age
* Extreme facial expressions (for example, screaming)

Face API is often successful in challenging cases like the above, but accuracy can be reduced. To make recognition more robust and address these challenges, train your Persons with photos that include a diversity of angles and lighting.
