# Migrate your face data to a different Face subscription

This guide shows you how to migrate an existing group of faces to a different Face API subscription using the Snapshot feature. This allows you to avoid having to repeatedly build up a PersonGroup or **FaceList** when moving or expanding your operations. For example, you may have created a PersonGroup using a free trial subscription and now want to migrate it to your paid subscription, or you may need to sync face data across regions for a large enterprise operation.

The same migration strategy also applies to **LargePersonGroup** and **LargeFaceList** objects. If you are not familiar with the concepts in this guide, see their definitions in the [glossary](../Glossary.md). This guide uses the Face API .NET client library with C#.

You take a snapshot of your data and then apply it to a data object on a new subscription.

## Prerequisites

- Two Face API subscription keys (one with the existing data, and one to migrate to). Follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to the Face API service and get your key.
- Two corresponding Face API subscription ID strings (found in the **Overview** blade on the Azure portal). 
- Any edition of [Visual Studio 2015 or 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).


## Create the Visual Studio project

1. In Visual Studio, create a new **Console app (.NET Framework)** project and name it **FaceMigration**. 
1. Get the required NuGet packages. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Click the **Browse** tab and select **Include prerelease**; then find and install the following package:
    - [Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.Face 2.2.0-preview](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.Face/2.2.0-preview)


## Create face clients

In the **Main** method in *Program.cs*, create two **[FaceClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.face.faceclient?view=azure-dotnet)** instances for your source and target subscriptions. In this example, we will use a Face subscription in the East Asia region as the source, and a West US subscription as the target. This will demonstrate how to migrate data from one Azure region to another.

```csharp
var FaceClientEastAsia = new FaceClient(new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials("<East Asia Subscription Key>"))
    {
        Endpoint = "<East Asia Endpoint Url>"
    };

var FaceClientWestUS = new FaceClient(new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials("<West US Subscription Key>"))
    {
        Endpoint = "<West US Endpoint Url>"
    };
```

You will need to fill in the subscription key values and endpoint URLs for your source and target subscriptions.


## Prepare a PersonGroup for migration

You need the ID of the PersonGroup in your source subscription to migrate it to the target subscription. Use the **[PersonGroupOperation.ListWithHttpMessages](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.face.persongroupoperations.listwithhttpmessagesasync?view=azure-dotnet#Microsoft_Azure_CognitiveServices_Vision_Face_PersonGroupOperations_ListWithHttpMessagesAsync_System_String_System_Nullable_System_Int32__System_Collections_Generic_Dictionary_System_String_System_Collections_Generic_List_System_String___System_Threading_CancellationToken_)** method to retrieve a list of your PersonGroup objects; then get the **[PersonGroup.PersonGroupId](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.face.models.persongroup.persongroupid?view=azure-dotnet#Microsoft_Azure_CognitiveServices_Vision_Face_Models_PersonGroup_PersonGroupId)** property. In the following code snippets, this ID is stored in `personGroupId`.

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code creates and trains a new PersonGroup to migrate, but in most cases you should already have a PersonGroup to use.

## Take a Snapshot of the PersonGroup

Use the source subscription **FaceClient** instance to take a snapshot of the PersonGroup, using **TakeAsync** with the PersonGroup ID and the target subscription's ID. If you have multiple target subscriptions, you can add them as additional array entries in the third parameter.

```csharp
var takeSnapshotResult = await FaceClientEastAsia.Snapshot.TakeAsync(
    "PersonGroup",
    personGroupId,
    new[] { "<Azure West US Subscription ID>" /* Put other IDs here, if multiple target subscriptions wanted */ });
```

## Retrieve the Snapshot ID

The snapshot retrieving method is asynchronous, so you'll need to wait for its completion. In this code, the `WaitForOperation` function monitors the method call, checking the status every 100ms. When the operation completes, you will be able to retrieve a snapshot ID. You can obtain it by parsing the `OperationLocation` field. A typical `OperationLocation` value will look like this:

```csharp
"/operations/a63a3bdd-a1db-4d05-87b8-dbad6850062a"
```

The following code waits for the snapshot-taking operation to complete and parses its result to get the take operation ID.

```csharp
var takeOperationId = takeSnapshotResult.OperationLocation.Split('/')[2];
var operationStatus = await WaitForOperation(FaceClientEastAsia, takeOperationId);
```

The `WaitForOperation` helper method is here:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Waits for the take/apply operation to complete and returns the final operation status.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>The final operation status.</returns>
private static async Task<OperationStatus> WaitForOperation(IFaceClient client, string operationId)
{
    OperationStatus operationStatus = null;
    do
    {
        if (operationStatus != null)
        {
            Thread.Sleep(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100));
        }

        // Get the status of the operation.
        operationStatus = await client.Snapshot.GetOperationStatusAsync(operationId);

        Console.WriteLine($"Operation Status: {operationStatus.Status}");
    }
    while (operationStatus.Status != OperationStatusType.Succeeded
            && operationStatus.Status != OperationStatusType.Failed);

    return operationStatus;
}
```

When the operation status is marked as `Succeeded`, you can then get the snapshot ID by parsing the `resourceLocation` field of the returned **OperationStatus** instance. A typical `resourceLocation` value will look like this:

```csharp
"/snapshots/e58b3f08-1e8b-4165-81df-aa9858f233dc"
```

Parse the snapshot ID with the following line:

```csharp
var snapshotId = operationStatus.ResourceLocation.Split('/')[2];
```

## Apply Snapshot to target subscription

Next, create the new PersonGroup in the target subscription, using a randomly generated ID. Then use the target subscription's **FaceClient** instance to apply the snapshot to this PersonGroup, passing in the snapshot ID and new PersonGroup ID. 

> [!NOTE]
> A Snapshot object is only valid for 48 hours. You should only take a snapshot if you intend to use it for data migration soon after.

```csharp
var newPersonGroupId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
var applySnapshotResult = await FaceClientWestUS.Snapshot.ApplyAsync(snapshotId, newPersonGroupId);
```

A snapshot apply request will return an operation ID. You can get this ID by parsing the `OperationLocation` field of the returned **applySnapshotResult** instance. A typical `OperationLocation` value will look like this:

```csharp
"/operations/84276574-2a2a-4540-a1b0-f65d834d225b"
```

Parse the apply operation ID with the following line:

```csharp
var applyOperationId = applySnapshotResult.OperationLocation.Split('/')[2];
```

The snapshot application process is also asynchronous, so again use `WaitForOperation` to wait for it to complete.

```csharp
operationStatus = await WaitForOperation(FaceClientWestUS, applyOperationId);
```

## Test the data migration

After you've applied the snapshot, the new PersonGroup in the target subscription should be populated with the original face data. By default, training results are also copied, so the new PersonGroup will be ready for face identification calls without needing retraining.

To test the data migration, you can run the following operations and compare their results.

```csharp
await DisplayPersonGroup(FaceClientEastAsia, personGroupId);
await IdentifyInPersonGroup(FaceClientEastAsia, personGroupId);

await DisplayPersonGroup(FaceClientWestUS, newPersonGroupId);
// No need to retrain the person group before identification,
// training results are copied by snapshot as well.
await IdentifyInPersonGroup(FaceClientWestUS, newPersonGroupId);
```

Use the following helper methods:

```csharp
private static async Task DisplayPersonGroup(IFaceClient client, string personGroupId)
{
    var personGroup = await client.PersonGroup.GetAsync(personGroupId);
    Console.WriteLine("Person Group:");
    Console.WriteLine(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(personGroup));

    // List persons.
    var persons = await client.PersonGroupPerson.ListAsync(personGroupId);

    foreach (var person in persons)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(person));
    }

    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Identification against the person group.
/// </summary>
private static async Task IdentifyInPersonGroup(IFaceClient client, string personGroupId)
{
    using (var fileStream = new FileStream("data\\PersonGroup\\Daughter\\Daughter1.jpg", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
    {
        var detectedFaces = await client.Face.DetectWithStreamAsync(fileStream);

        var result = await client.Face.IdentifyAsync(detectedFaces.Select(face => face.FaceId.Value).ToList(), personGroupId);
        Console.WriteLine("Test identify against PersonGroup");
        Console.WriteLine(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(result));
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
}
```

## Clean up resources

Once you are finished migrating face data, we recommend you manually delete the snapshot object by running the following code.

```csharp
await FaceClientEastAsia.Snapshot.DeleteAsync(snapshotId);
```

## Tips

- You can fire multiple snapshot taking requests for a PersonGroup at the same time, applying one same snapshot to personGroup under different subscriptions or to different personGroups under the same subscription at the same time. To be clear, the personGroup to be applied should be newly created and not applied any snapshot before. Currently, the snapshot apply model does not support replace operation.

- The snapshot taking and applying operation does not support cancelling for now.

- Snapshot does not break any operation to the source PersonGroup when taking or the target PersonGroup when applying, but it is not guaranteed to work as expected when calling PersonGroup (Person, Face) - Management and PersonGroup - Train.
