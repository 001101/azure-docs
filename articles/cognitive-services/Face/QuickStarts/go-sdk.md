# Quickstart: Face client library for Go

Get started with the Face client library for Go. Follow these steps to install the library and try out our examples for basic tasks. The Face service provides you with access to advanced algorithms for detecting and recognizing human faces in images.

Use the Face service client library for Go to:

* [Detect faces in an image](#detect-faces-in-an-image)
* [Find similar faces](#find-similar-faces)
* [Create and train a person group](#create-and-train-a-person-group)
* [Identify a face](#identify-a-face)
* [Take a snapshot for data migration](#take-a-snapshot-for-data-migration)

[Reference documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face) | [SDK download](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Setting up

### Create a Face Azure resource 

Begin using the Face service by creating an Azure resource. Choose the resource type that's right for you:

* A [trial resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) (no Azure subscription needed): 
    * Valid for seven days, for free. After signing up, a trial key and endpoint will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/). 
    * This is a great option if you want to try Face service, but donâ€™t have an Azure subscription.
* A [ Face service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace):
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
    * Use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* A [Multi-Service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne):
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.  
    * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Cognitive Services.

### Create an environment variable

>[!NOTE]
> The endpoints for non-trial resources created after July 1, 2019 use the custom subdomain format shown below. For more information and a complete list of regional endpoints, see [Custom subdomain names for Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains). 

Using your key and endpoint from the resource you created, create two environment variables for authentication:
* `FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` - The resource key for authenticating your requests.
* `FACE_ENDPOINT` - The resource endpoint for sending API requests. It will look like this: 
  * `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com` 

Use the instructions for your operating system.
<!-- replace the below endpoint and key examples -->
#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY <replace-with-your-product-name-key>
setx FACE_ENDPOINT <replace-with-your-product-name-endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variable, restart the console window.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=<replace-with-your-product-name-key>
export FACE_ENDPOINT=<replace-with-your-product-name-endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variable, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

#### [macOS](#tab/unix)

Edit your `.bash_profile`, and add the environment variable:

```bash
export FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=<replace-with-your-product-name-key>
export FACE_ENDPOINT=<replace-with-your-product-name-endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variable, run `source .bash_profile` from your console window to make the changes effective.
***

### Create a Go project directory

In a console window (cmd, PowerShell, Terminal, Bash), create a new workspace for your Go project, named `my-app`, and navigate to it.

```
mkdir -p my-app/{src, bin, pkg}  
cd my-app
```

Your workspace will contain three folders:

* **src** - This directory will contain source code and packages. Any packages installed with the `go get` command will go here.
* **pkg** - This directory will contain the compiled Go package objects. These files all have a `.a` extension.
* **bin** - This directory will contains the binary executable files that are created when you run `go install`.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about the structure of a Go workspace, see the [Go language documentation](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces). This guide includes information for setting `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT`.

### Install the client library for Go

Next, install the client library for Go:

```bash
go get -u https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face
```

or if you use dep, within your repo run:

```bash
dep ensure -add https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face
```

### Create a Go application

Next, create a file in the **src** directory named `sample-app.go`:

```bash
cd src
touch sample-app.go
```

Open `sample-app.go` in your preferred IDE or text editor. Then add the package name and import the following libraries:

[!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/Face/FaceQuickstart.go?name=snippet_imports)]

Next, you'll begin adding code to carry out different Face service operations.

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Face service Go SDK.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|[BaseClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#BaseClient) | This class represents your authorization to use the Face service, and you need it for all Face functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and you use it to produce instances of other classes. |
|[Client](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#Client)|This class handles the basic detection and recognition tasks that you can do with human faces. |
|[DetectedFace](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#DetectedFace)|This class represents all of the data that was detected from a single face in an image. You can use it to retrieve detailed information about the face.|
|[ListClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#ListClient)|This class manages the cloud-stored **FaceList** constructs, which store an assorted set of faces. |
|[PersonGroupPersonClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#PersonGroupPersonClient)| This class manages the cloud-stored **Person** constructs, which store a set of faces that belong to a single person.|
|[PersonGroupClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#PersonGroupClient)| This class manages the cloud-stored **PersonGroup** constructs, which store a set of assorted **Person** objects. |
|[SnapshotClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#SnapshotClient)|This class manages the Snapshot functionality. You can use it to temporarily save all of your cloud-based Face data and migrate that data to a new Azure subscription. |

## Code examples

These code samples show you how to complete basic tasks using the Face service client library for Go:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Detect faces in an image](#detect-faces-in-an-image)
* [Find similar faces](#find-similar-faces)
* [Create and train a person group](#create-and-train-a-person-group)
* [Identify a face](#identify-a-face)
* [Take a snapshot for data migration](#take-a-snapshot-for-data-migration)

## Authenticate the client

> [!NOTE] 
> This quickstart assumes you've [created environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for your Face key and endpoint, named `FACE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `FACE_ENDPOINT` respectively.

Create a `main` function and add the following code to it to instantiate a client with your endpoint and key. You create a [CognitiveServicesAuthorizer](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest#CognitiveServicesAuthorizer) object with your key, and use it with your endpoint to create a [Client](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v1.0/face#Client) object.

## Run the application

Run your Go application with the `go run [arguments]` command from your application directory.

```bash
go run sample-app.go
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
