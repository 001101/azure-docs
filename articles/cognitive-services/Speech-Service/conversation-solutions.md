The Speech SDK's **ConversationTranslator** API allows you to transcribe meetings and other conversations with the ability to add, remove, and identify multiple participants by streaming audio to Speech Services using `PullStream` or `PushStream`. This topic requires you to know how to use Speech-to-text with the Speech SDK (version 1.8.0 or later). For more information, see [What are Speech Services](overview.md).
