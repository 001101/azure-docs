# About the Speech SDK compressed audio input stream

The Speech SDK's **Compressed Audio Input Stream** API provides a way to stream compressed audio to the speech service using PullStream or PushStream.

Compressed audio input format is currently only supported for C++, C#, and Java on the Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04 platform. Only MP3 and OPUS/OGG are the supported input audio formats.

On Linux, you need to install these additional SDK dependencies to enable the compressed audio input format feature.

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly
  ```

To stream a compressed audio format to the speech service, you create your own `PullAudioInputStream` or `PushAudioInputStream`. Then create an `AudioConfig` from an instance of your stream class, specifying the compression format of the stream.

If you have an instance of your input stream class `myPushStream` and the OPUS/OGG format, the code will look similar to this:

  ```C#
  var audioFormat = AudioStreamFormat.GetCompressedFormat(Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio.AudioStreamContainerFormat.OGG_OPUS);
  var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromStreamInput(myPushStream, audioFormat);
  ```

Finally you create your speech recognizer. Pass in both, your regular speech configuration, and the audio input configuration.

  ```C#
  var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription(...);
  
  var audioFormat = AudioStreamFormat.GetCompressedFormat(Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio.AudioStreamContainerFormat.OGG_OPUS);
  var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromStreamInput(myPushStream, audioFormat);

  var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

  // run stream through recognizer
  var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();

  var text = result.GetText();
  ```
