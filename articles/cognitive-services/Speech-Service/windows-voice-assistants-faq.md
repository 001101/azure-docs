# Frequently asked questions

## General

### How do I contact Microsoft for resources like Limited Access Feature tokens and 1st stage keyword model files?


## Implementation

### Do I have to use Direct Line Speech for my Windows Conversational Agent?

The UWP Sample Application was developed using Direct Line Speech and the Speech Services SDK as a demonstration of how to use a dialog service with the Windows Conversational Agent capability. However, you can use any service for local and cloud keyword verification, speech-to-text conversion, bot dialog, and text-to-speech conversion. See how in the [UWP Sample Application docs]().
