# Frequently asked questions

## How do I contact Microsoft for resources like Limited Access Feature tokens and keyword model files?



## My app is showing in a small window when I activate it by voice. How can I transition from the compact view to a full application window?

When your application is first activated by voice, it is started in a compact view. Please read the [Design guidance for voice activation preview](windows-voice-assistants-best-practices#Design-guidance-for-voice-activation-preview) for guidance on the different views and transitions between them for voice assistants on Windows.

To make the transition from compact view to full app view, use the appView API `TryEnterViewModeAsync`:

`var appView = ApplicationView.GetForCurrentView();
 await appView.TryEnterViewModeAsync(ApplicationViewMode.Default);`

## Why are voice assistant features on Windows only enabled for UWP applications?

Given the privacy risks associated with features like voice activation, the features of the UWP platform are necessary allow the voice assistant features on Windows to be sufficiently secure.

## The UWP Voice Assistant Sample uses Direct Line Speech. Do I have to use Direct Line Speech for my voice assistant on Windows?

The UWP Sample Application was developed using Direct Line Speech and the Speech Services SDK as a demonstration of how to use a dialog service with the Windows Conversational Agent capability. However, you can use any service for local and cloud keyword verification, speech-to-text conversion, bot dialog, and text-to-speech conversion.
