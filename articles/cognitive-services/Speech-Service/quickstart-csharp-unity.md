# Quickstart: Recognize speech with the Speech SDK for Unity (beta)

[!INCLUDE [Selector](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-selector.md)]

Use this guide to create a speech-to-text application using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and the Speech SDK for Unity (beta).
When finished, you can use your computer's microphone to transcribe speech to text in real time.

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech SDK for Unity is currently in beta.
> It supports Windows x86 and x64 (stand-alone desktop application or Universal Windows Platform), and Android (ARM32/64, x86).

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you'll need:

* [Unity 2018.3 or later](https://store.unity.com/).
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* A subscription key for the Speech Service. [Get one for free](get-started.md).
* Access to your computer's microphone

## Create a Unity project

* Start Unity and under the **Projects** tab select **New**.
* Specify **Project name** as **csharp-unity**, **Template** as **3D** and pick a location.
  Then select **Create project**.
* After a bit of time, the Unity Editor window should pop up.

## Install the Speech SDK

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

* The Speech SDK for Unity (beta) is packaged as a Unity asset package (.unitypackage).
  Download it from [here](https://aka.ms/csspeech/unitypackage).
* Import the Speech SDK by selecting **Assets** > **Import Package** > **Custom Package**.
* In the file picker, select the Speech SDK .unitypackage file that you downloaded above.
* Ensure that all files are selected and click **Import**.

## Add UI

We will add a text field as minimal UI that is used to show speech recognition output.

* In the [Hierarchy Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html), a sample scene is shown that Unity created with the new project.
* Right-click into it, and select **UI** > **Text**.
* This creates three game objects: a **Text** object nested within a **Canvas** object, and an **EventSystem** object (which we will not need).

## Add the sample code

1. In the [Project Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html), click the **Create** button and then select **C# script**. Name the script `HelloWorld`.

1. Edit the script by double-clicking it.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can configure which code editor will be launched under **Edit** > **Preferences**, see the [Unity user manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Preferences.html)).

1. Replace all code with the following:

   ```csharp
   // TODO
   ```

1. Locate and replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech Service subscription key.

1. Locate and replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription. For example, if you're using the free trial, the region is `westus`.

1. Save the changes to the script and close your code editor.

1. The script needs to be added as a component to one of your game objects.

  * Click on the **Canvas** object in the Hierarchy Window. This opens up its setting in the [Inspector Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) (by default on the right).
  * Click the **Add Component** button in the Inspector Window, then search for the HelloWorld script we create above and add it.
  * You will note that the Hello World component has a **Recognized Text** property that says `None (Text)`.
    Click the Object Picker (the small circle icon to the right of the property), and choose the **Text** object you created earlier.

## Run the sample in the Unity Editor

* Press the **Play** button in the Unity Editor toolbar (below the menu bar).
  * When you say something after the app has been launched, you'll see the recognized text in the Unity Editor's Game Window.
  * Check also the [Console Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html) for debug messages.
* Click the **Play** button again to stop running the app.
