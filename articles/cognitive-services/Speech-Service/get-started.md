# Get started with the Speech service

To get started with the Speech service, first sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't already have one.

Next, get a free trial of the Speech service through [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/). You'll get access to two subscription keys that you can use to start with (you can use either). 

> [!NOTE]
> When your trial subscription expires, you can sign up for a paid subscription through your Azure dashboard.

Finally, download an SDK and some sample code to play around with.
