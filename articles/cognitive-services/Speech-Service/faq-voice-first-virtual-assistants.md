# Voice-first virtual assistants (Preview): frequently asked questions (FAQ)

If you can't find answers to your questions in this FAQ, check out [other support options](support.md).

## General

**Q: How do I get started?**

**A:** The best way to begin with creating a voice-first virtual assistant is to start with [creating a basic Bot Framework bot](../../bot-service/bot-builder-tutorial-basic-deploy?view=azure-bot-service-4.0). Next, connect your bot to the [Direct Line Speech channel](../../bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-directlinespeech.md).

## Debugging

**Q: I'm getting an error when using a SpeechBotConnector and it's not clear what I should do. What *should* I do?**

**A:** File-based logging provides substantially more detail and can help accelerate support requests. To enable this, see [how to use file logging](how-to-use-file-logging.md).
