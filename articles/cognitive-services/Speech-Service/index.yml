abstract: 
  description: The Microsoft Speech Service and SDK provides developers an easy way to create powerful speech-enabled features in their applications, like voice command control, transcription and dictation. Cortana, Microsoft Office, and others use the same technology. A key differentiator of Microsoft Speech Service is the ability to customize <a href="http://aka.ms/customspeech">Speech-to-Text</a> acoustic and language models to accommodate specialized vocabulary, noisy environments, and different ways of speaking. In fact, customized <a href="http://aka.ms/customvoice">Text-to-speech</a> and  <a href="http://aka.ms/customtranslator">Speech-Translation</a> are available as well.<br/><br/>Our Speech SDK is available on multiple platforms in several programming languages -- taking care of live microphone management, real-time streaming, or batch-based file communication depending on your applications needs.

    html: Our Speech SDK supports *Speech-to-Text* (STT), or speech recognition.  The Speech SDK transcribes audio streams into text that your application can accept as input. Your application can then, for example, enter the text into a document or act upon it as a command. For the full list of supported languages in each recognition mode, see [supported languages](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/supported-languages?branch=pr-en-us-39478#speech-to-text).

    text: 'The Speech SDK supports interactive speech transcription with real-time continuous recognition and interim results. It also supports end-of-speech detection, optional automatic capitalization and punctuation, profanity masking, and text normalization.'
