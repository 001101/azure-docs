# Overview

## Voice Assistants on Windows

On Windows 10 version 2004 and up, voice assistant applications can take advantage of the Windows ConversationalAgent APIs to achieve a complete voice-enabled assistant experience.

| Feature | Details |
|----------|----------|
|Voice Activation | A voice agent can be activated by a spoken keyword, even when the agent application is closed.
|Above Lock Activation | Voice agents can be launched with voice activation while the user's computer is locked, even if the lid is closed.
|Multiple Agent Management | If multiple voice agents are installed, Windows will manage them properly and notify each voice assistant if they are interrupted or deactivated.
|Privacy Management | A set of voice-activation privacy settings gives users control of voice activation and above lock activation on a per-app basis.
