# Overview

## What is the Conversational Agent Platform?

Voice assistants running on Windows require a unique set of capabilities for a complete user experience. The Conversational Agent Platform powered by Windows 10 was built to give voice agent applications access to these capabilities and enable full fledged voice assistant experiences on Windows.

## Capabilities

### Voice Activation

By registering with the Conversational Agent Platform, a voice agent can be activated by a spoken keyword, even when the agent application is closed.

### Above Lock Activation

Voice agents can be launched with voice activation while the user's computer is locked, even if the lid is closed.

### Multiple Agent Management

If multiple voice agents are installed, the Conversational Agent Platform will manage them properly and notify each voice assistant if they are interrupted or deactivated.

### Privacy

The Conversational Agent Platform includes a set of privacy settings, giving users control of voice activation and above lock activation on a per-app basis.
