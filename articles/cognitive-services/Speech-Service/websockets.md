# Speech service WebSockets protocols

The WebSockets APIs of the unified Speech service are similar to the APIs provided by the [Speech service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/Speech) (formerly known as the Bing Speech Service) and the [Translator Speech service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator-speech/). In general, only the endpoints used differ.

> [!NOTE]
> The Text to Speech feature does not have a WebSockets API. See [REST APIs](rest-apis.md).

## Speech to Text API

In the Speech to Text API, only the endpoints used differ from the previous Speech service Speech Recognition API. Use the one that is appropriate to your subscription. The new endpoints are shown in the table below.

TODO new endpoints needed

Keep these differences in mind as you read the [WebSockets protocol documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech/api-reference-rest/websocketprotocol) for the Speech service.

The Speech to Text API also supports a [REST API](rest-apis.md) for recognition of short recordings of speech.

## Speech Translation API

In the Speech Translation API, only the endpoints used differ from the Translator SPeech API. Use the one that is appropriate to your subscription. The new endpoints are shown in the table below.

TODO new endpoints needed

Keep these differences in mind as you read the [WebSockets protocol documentation](http://docs.microsofttranslator.com/speech-translate.html) for the Translator Speech service.
