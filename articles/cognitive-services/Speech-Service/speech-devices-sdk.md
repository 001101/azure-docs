# Speech Devices SDK (Preview)

On its own, the Microsoft Speech service works with a wide variety of devices and audio sources. Now you can take your speech applications to the next level with matched hardware and software. The Speech Devices SDK is a pre-tuned library paired with specific microphone-enabled hardware that makes it easy to integrate with the full range of cloud-based Microsoft Speech services, creating exceptional user experiences for your customers.

The SDK allows you to build your own ambient devices with a customized wake word—so the cue that initiates a user interaction is unique to your brand. It also provides superior audio processing from multi-channel sources for more accurate speech recognition, including noise suppression, echo cancellation, far-field voice, and beamforming.

Working with the Microsoft Speech service and other APIs, the SDK enables developers to facilitate a variety of voice-enabled scenarios like drive-thru ordering systems, in-car or in-home assistants, smart speakers, and other digital assistants. You could reply to users with text, speak back to them in a default or custom voice, provide search results, translate to other languages, and more.
