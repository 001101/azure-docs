# Recording audio for a custom voice

Creating a high-quality production custom voice from scratch is no casual undertaking. The central component of a custom voice is a substantial collection of audio samples from a human speaker. It's vital that these audio recordings be consistent and of high quality. Choose voice talent that has experience making these kinds of recordings, and have them recorded by a competent recording engineer using professional equipment.

Before you can make the recordings, though, you need a script: the words that will be read by your voice talent to create the audio samples. For best results, your script must have good phonetic coverage and sufficient variety to train the custom voice model.

Many different factors go into a good custom voice. This guide serves as an introduction to and overview of the process, with particular attention given to issues you are likely to encounter.

> [!TIP]
> For the highest quality results, consider engaging Microsoft to help develop your custom voice. We have extensive experience producing high-quality voices for our own products, including Cortana and Office.

## Voice recording roles

There are four basic roles in a voice recording project for custom voices.

Role|Purpose
-|-
Voice talent        |The person whose voice will form the basis of the custom voice.
Recording engineer  |The person who oversees the technical aspects of the recording and operates the recording equipment.
Director            |Prepares the script and coaches the voice talent on his or her performance.
Editor              |Finalizes the audio files and prepares them for upload to the Custom Voice portal.

It is common for one person to fill more than one role. This guide assumes that the reader will be primarily filling the director and editor roles, and hiring voice talent and a recording engineer. There is, however, some information about the recording engineer role in case you want to make the recordings yourself.

## Choosing voice talent

The best voice talent for creating a custom voice model is typically an actor with experience in voiceover or voice character work (for example, in animation). You can also often find suitable talent among announcers and newsreaders. Choose voice talent whose natural voice you like; don't ask him or her to "do a voice," as this causes voice strain that can make it hard to make consistent recordings.

> [!TIP]
> Generally, avoid using recognizable voices to create a custom voiceâ€”unless, of course, your goal is to produce a celebrity voice. Lesser-known voices are usually less distracting to users.

The most important single factor in choosing voice talent is consistency. Ideally, all recordings should sound like they were made on the same day in the same room. This ideal can be partly reached through good recording practices and engineering. However, your voice talent must be able to speak with consistent rate, volume level, pitch, and tone. Clear diction is a must. Your talent also needs the ability to strictly control his or her pitch variation, emotional affect, and speech mannerisms.

Recording samples for a custom voice is more fatiguing than many other kinds of voice work. Most voice talent can record for two or three hours a day, though some can do four. Limit sessions to three or four a week depending on length, with a day off in between if possible.

Recordings made for a voice model should be emotionally neutral. That is, a sad utterance should not be read in a sad way. The recordings will be broken down into individual speech sounds (phonemes) and used to synthesize new utterances. These new utterances may have an emotional context completely different from the original. Only if the recording is emotionally neutral can realistic inflection can be synthesized in new speech.

Work with your voice talent to develop a "character" that defines overall sound and emotional tone of the custom voice. This process will pinpoint what "neutral" sounds like for that character. A person may have, for example, an upbeat personality, and his or her voice may carry an inherent note of optimism even when speaking neutrally. However, any such personality trait should be subtle and, of course, consistent. Listen to some existing TTS voices reading text to get the idea.

### Legalities

Usually, you'll want to own the voice recordings you make. Your voice talent should therefore be amenable to a work-for-hire contract for the project.

## Creating a script

The starting point of any custom voice is the script, which contains the utterances to be recorded by your voice talent.

> [!NOTE]
> We use the term "utterances" because they may or may not be full sentences. Phrases are fine.

The utterances in your script can come from virtually anywhere: fiction, non-fiction, transcripts of speeches, news reports, and anything else available in printed form. If you want to make sure your voice does well on specific kinds of words (such as medical terminology or programming jargon), you may want to include sentences from scholarly papers or technical documents. (However, see [Legalities](#legalities) below.) You can also write your own text.

It is not necessary that all the utterances come from the same source, or the same kind of source. The utterances don't even need to have anything to do with each other. However, if you will use set phrases (for example, "You have successfully logged in") in your speech application, make sure these are included. As a bonus, if you later decide to use the recording in place of synthesized speech, you'll have it available.

While consistency is key in choosing voice talent, variety is the hallmark of a good script. Your script should include many different words and sentences with a variety of sentence lengths, structures, and moods. Every sound in the language should be represented multiple times and in numerous contexts (ctalled *phonetic coverage).* 

Furthermore, the text should incorporate all the ways that a given sound can be represented in writing, and place these sounds at varying places in the sentences. Both declarative sentences and questions should be included, and read with appropriate intonation.

It's difficult to write a script that provides *just enough* data to allow the Custom Speech portal to build a great voice. In practice, the simplest way to make a script that achieves full phonetic coverage is to "make it up in volume." Microsoft's standard voices were built from tens of thousands of utterances. You should be prepared to record a few to several thousand utterances to build a production-quality custom voice.

Check the script carefully for errors. If possible, have someone else check it too. WMhen you run through the script with your talent, you'll probably catch a few more.

### Script format

A basic script format has three columns, which you can easily set up using Microsoft Word.

* The number of the utterance, starting at 1. This will make it easy for everyone in the studio to refer to a particular utterance ("let's try number 56 again").
* A blank column where you'll write in the time code of each utterance (that is, the time at which you'll find it in the recorded audio file).
* The text of the utterance itself.

![Sample script](media/custom-voice/script.png)

Leave enough space after each row for you and the voice talent to write notes. Be sure that no utterance is split between pages if it spans multiple lines. Number the pages and print your script on one side of the paper to avoid having to flip the pages during the recording session.

Print three copies of the script: one for the talent, one for the engineer, and one for the director (you). Don't staple the pages together: an experienced voice artist will take them out before recording to avoid making noise as the pages are turned.

### Legalities

Under copyright law, n actor's reading of a copyrighted work is a performance for which the author of the work may need to be compensated. A performance created for the purpose of creating a custom voice will not be recognizable in the final result of the process. Even so, the legality of using a copyrighted work for this purpose may not be well-established. Microsoft cannot provide legal advice on this issue; consult your own counsel.

Fortunately, it is easy to sidestep rights issues when gathering text for your script. There are many sources of text you can use without potential legal issues, such as the ones listed below.

|||
|-|-|
|[CMU Arctic corpus](http://festvox.org/cmu_arctic/)|About 1100 sentences selected from out-of-copyright works specifically for use in speech synthesis projects. An excellent starting point.|
|Works with<br>expired copyright|Typically works published prior to 1923. For English, Project Gutenberg offers tens of thousands of such works. You may want to focus on newer works, as the language will be closer to what we use today.|
|Government&nbsp;works|Works created by the United States government are not copyrighted in the United States, though the government may claim copyright in other countries.|
|Public domain|Works for which copyright has been explicitly disclaimed or that have been dedicated to the public domain.|
|Permissively-licensed works|Works distributed under a license such as Creative Commons or the GNU Free Documentation License. Wikipedia uses the GFDL. Some licenses, however, may impose restrictions on performance of the licensed content that may impact the creation of a custom voice model, so read the license carfully.|

## Recording your script

If at all possible, record your script at a professional recording studio that specializes in voiceover work. They'll have a separate recording booth, the right equipment for the job, and the right people to operate it. It pays not to skimp on this.

Discuss your project with the studio's recording engineer and listen to his or her advice. The recording should little or no dynamic range compression (maximum of 4:1). He or she may choose to use an equalizer to help reduce sounds outside the range of human speech. It is critical that the audio be consistent in volume, with a high signal-to-noise ratio, and free of mouth noises and other extraneous sounds.

### Doing it yourself

If you want to try doing the recording yourself, here are some tips.

* Your "recording booth" should be a small room with no noticeable echo or "room tone" and which is as quiet and soundproof as possible. Drapes on the walls can be used to reduce echo and neutralize or "deaden" the sound of the room.

* Use a high quality studio condenser microphone. (Neumann, Sennheiser, and AKG are good brands.) You can rent one from a local audio-visual rental firm. You will also need a mic pre-amp. Professional gear has balanced XLR connectors rather than the 1/4" connectors found on consumer equipment.

* Install the microphone on a stand and use a pop filter on the microphone to eliminate noise from "plosive" sounds like "p" and "b." 

* The voice talent must always be the same distance from the microphone. Use tape on the floor to mark where they should stand. If the talent prefers to sit, take special care. Sitting may complicate maintaining a constant distance from the mic, and adds a new source of unwanted sounds to watch out for (the chair).

* Use a stand to hold the script; avoid angling the stand so that it can reflect sound toward the microphone.

* The person actually doing the recordingâ€”the engineerâ€”should be in a separate room from the talent, with some way to talk to the talent in the recording booth.

* The recording should contain as little noise as possible, with a goal of an 80 db signal-to-noise ratio or better. (This is where a real studio comes in handy.) 

    Listen closely to a recording of silence, figure out where any noise is coming from, and eliminate the cause. Common sources of noise are air ducts, fluorescent light ballasts, traffic on nearby roads, and equipment fans (eves notebook PCs may have fans). Microphones can pick up electrical noise from AC wiring. 

    > [!TIP]
    > In some cases, you may be able to use an equalizer or noise reduction software plug-in to help remove noise from your recordings, though it is always best to stop it at its source.


* Levels should be set so that most of the available dynamic range of digital recording is used without overdriving into distortion. That means loud, but not so loud that the audio distorts. Below is an example of the waveform of a good recording.

    ![good recording waveform](media/custom-voice/good-recording.png)

    You can see that most of the range (height) is used, but the highest peaks of the signal do not reach the top of the window. You can also see that the silence in the recording is very close to a line, indicating a low noise floor. This recording has acceptable dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio.

* Record directly into the computer using a high-quality audio interface with balanced XLR connectors. Keep the audio chain simple: mic, preamp, audio interface, computer. Use Pro Tools if you have it available; if you're on a budget, try the free [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

* Record at 44.1 KHz 16 bit monophonic (CD quality). You'll have to downsample your audio to 16 KHz before you submit it to the Custom Voice portal, but it pays to have a highest-quality original recording in case edits are needed.

* Ideally, have different people serve in the roles of director, engineer, and talent. Don't try to do it all yourself! In a pinch, the director and engineer could be a single person.

### Before the session

To avoid wasting studio time, run through the script with your voice talent before the session. The voice talent gains familiarity with the text, and has an opportunity to clarify the pronunciation of any unfamiliar words.

> [!NOTE]
> Many recording studios offer electronic display of scripts in the recording booth. In this case, take notes from your run-through directly into the script's document. You'll still want a paper copy to take notes on, though. So will the engineer. And you'll still want a third printed copy as a backup in case the copmuter is down!

Your voice talent may ask which word you want emphasized in each utterance. Knowing the "operative word" is important to an actor's performance, but in this case, you want a neutral reading with no particular word emphasized. Emphasis is added when new speech is synthesized; it is not a part of the audio recordings.

Be sure that the talent knows to pronounce words distinctly. Every word of the script should be pronounced as written. Sounds should not be dropped or slurred together, as is common in casual speech.

|Written text|Unwanted pronunciation|
|-|-|
|never going to give you up|never gonna give you up|
|there are four lights|there're four lights|
|how's the weather today|how's th' weather today|

However, talent should *not* insert distinct pauses between words. The sentence should still flow naturally. This distinction may take some practice to get right.

### The recording session

Create a reference recording early in the session of a typical utterance and play it back to the voice talent regularly to help them keep their performance consistent. The engineer can use it as a reference for levels and overall consistency of sound. This is especially important when resuming work after a break, or on another day.

Coach your talent to take a deep breath and pause before each utterance. Record a couple of seconds of silence between utterances.

Record a good five seconds of silence before the first recording to capture the "room tone." You'll upload this as part of that first file to help the Custom Voice portal compensate for any remaining noise in the recordings.

> [!TIP]
> All you really need is the voice talent's work, so you can record only one channel. However, if you record in stereo, the second channel can be used to record the conversation in the control room so you can refer to it later. You would then remove this track from the version uploaded to the Custom Voice portal.

Listen closely, using headphones, to the voice talent's performance. You're looking for good but natural diction, correct pronunciation, and a lack of unwanted sounds. Don't hesitate to ask your talent to re-record an utterance that doesn't meet these standards. Pacing should be consistent; a metronome played through the talent's headphones may be helpful if they're having trouble. Words should be pronounced the same way each time they appear.

> [!TIP] 
> If you are recording a high volume of utterances, losing a single utterance may not affect the resulting voice in any way you'd notice. So it may be more expedient to simply note any utterances that have problems, exclude them from your data set, and see how your voice turns out. You can always come back to the studio and record missed utterances later.

Most studios have a large "time code" display indicating the current time in the recording. Take a note of the time on your script for each utterance. Ask the engineer if they can mark each utterance in the recording's metadata.

Take regular breaks to let the voice talent keep his or her voice in good shape. Make sure they are provided with something to drink to keep their throat from getting dry.

### After the session

Modern recording studios record digitally, so in the end you'll receive one or more audio files, WAV or AIFF format, in CD quality (44.1 KHz 16-bit) mono or stereo. You may be offered even higher-quality recordings, for example 96 KHz 24-bit, but CD quality is more than sufficient.

The studio probably delivered a single audio file per session. Your first goal is to create a separate file for each utterance. The recording engineer may have placed a marker in the file (or provided a separate *cue list)* to indicate where each utterance starts in the file. This metadata can be used to extract each utterance and to a separate file, as required by the Custom Voice portal. The recording engineer may even be able to automate this process, which will save you significant time.

Otherwise, you'll need to go through the recording and make a separate WAV file for each utterance. Use your notes to find the exact utterances you want, then use a sound editing utility such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to copy each into a new file. Leave only about 0.2 second of silence at the beginning and end of each file except for the first, which should have a full five seconds. Do not use the audio editor to "zero out" the silent parts of the file.

Listen to each file to make sure it's good. At this stage, you could edit out small unwanted sounds that you missed during recording, such as clothing rustle, a chair squeak, or a lip smack, as long as it does not overlap any actual speech. If you can't fix a particular file, remove it from your data set entirely.

Downsample each file to 16 KHz before saving and, if you recorded in stereo, remove the second channel. Save each file in WAV format.

Archive the original recording in a safe place in case you need to go back to it later. Save your notes in a safe place, too.
