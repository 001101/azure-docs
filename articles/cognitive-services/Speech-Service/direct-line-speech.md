# About Direct Line Speech

## When to use Direct Line Speech

[Voice assistants](voice-assistants.md) process transcribed text from Speech Service [speech-to-text](speech-to-text.md), take action on the natural language input from the user, and then respond, often with spoken output from [text-to-speech](text-to-speech.md). These assistants are then connected to from a device using the Speech SDK's `DialogServiceConnector` object.

**Direct Line Speech** is a robust, end-to-end solution for creating a flexible and extensible voice assistant powered by the Bot Framework and its Direct Line Speech channel that is optimized for voice in, voice out interaction with bots.

Direct Line Speech offers the highest levels of customization and sophistication for voice assistants and is well-suited to conversational scenarios that are open-ended, natural, or hybrids of these with task completion or command-and-control use. This high degree of flexibility comes with a greater complexity, and scenarios that are scoped to well-defined tasks using natural language input may want to consider [Custom Commands Preview](custom-commands.md) for a streamlined solution experience.

## Get started with Direct Line Speech

The first steps for creating a voice assistant using Direct Line Speech are to get a speech subscription key, create a new bot associated with that subscription, and connect the bot to the Direct Line Speech Channel.

For a complete, step-by-step guide on creating a simple voice assistant using Direct Line Speech, see [the tutorial for speech-enabling your bot with the Speech SDK and the Direct Line Speech channel](tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk.md).

We also offer quickstarts designed to have you running code in less than 10 minutes. This table includes a list of voice assistant quickstarts organized by language.

## Sample code

Sample code for creating a voice assistant is available on GitHub. These samples cover the client application for connecting to your assistant in several popular programming languages.

* [Tutorial: Voice enable your assistant with the Speech SDK, C#](tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk.md)

## Customization

Voice assistants built using Azure Speech Services can use the full range of customization options available for [speech-to-text](speech-to-text.md), [text-to-speech](text-to-speech.md), and [custom keyword selection](speech-devices-sdk-create-kws.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Customization options vary by language/locale (see [Supported languages](supported-languages.md)).

Direct Line Speech and its associated functionality for voice assistants are an ideal supplement to the [Virtual Assistant Solution and Enterprise Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-enterprise-template-overview). Though Direct Line Speech can work with any compatible bot, these resources provide a reusable baseline for high-quality conversational experiences as well as common supporting skills and models for getting started quickly.
