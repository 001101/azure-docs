# Add configurations to commands parameters
In this article, you will learn more about parameter configuration. In the previous [section](how-to-custom-commands-add-parameters-to-commands.md) - we mainly focused on configuring the *type* attribute of configuration. Now we will learn:
 - How parameter values can belong to a set defined externally to custom commands application
 - How to add validation clauses on the value of the parameters

## Prerequisites

You must have completed the steps in the following articles:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [How To: Create application with simple commands](./how-to-custom-commands-create-application-with-simple-commands.md)
> * [How To: Add parameters to commands](./how-to-custom-commands-add-parameters-to-commands.md)


## Configure parameter as external catalog entity

In this article, you will learn how to configure string type parameters to refer to external catalogs hosted over a web endpoint. This way, you can update the external catalog independently without making edits to the Custom Commands application.
This approach comes handy in the cases where the catalog entries can be large in number.
### Use external string catalog entity configuration

1. For this, let's reuse **SubjectDevice** parameter from the **TurnOnOff** command.
1. The current configuration for this parameter is **Accept predefined inputs from internal catalog**. This refers to static list of devices as defined in the parameter configuration. We want to move out this content to an external data source which can be updated independently.


### Add an external catalog endpoint

1. For this, start by adding a new web endpoint. Go to **Web endpoints** section in the left pane and add a new web endpoint with configuration as:

     | Setting                           | Suggested value                     |
   | --------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------|
   | Name                              | `getDevices`                                |
   | URL                          |`https://aka.ms/speech/cc-sampledevices`                                |
   | Method                              | GET                                |


    In case, the suggest value for URL doesn't work for you - you need to configure and host a simple web endpoint which returns json consisting of list of the devices which can be controlled. The web endpoint should return a json of below format:
        
    ```json
    {
        "fan" : [],
        "refrigerator" : [
            "fridge"
        ],
        "lights" : [
            "bulb",
            "bulbs",
            "light"
            "light bulb"
        ],
        "tv" : [
            "telly",
            "television"
            ]
    }
    
    ```


1. Next go the **SubjectDevice** parameter settings page and change the properties as follows-

   | Setting                           | Suggested value                     |
   | --------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------|
   | Configuration                     | Accept predefined inputs from external catalog |                                |
   | Catalog endpoint                  | getDevices                                 |
   | Method                            | GET                             |
1. Select **Save**.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You wouldn't see an option to configure a parameter to accept inputs from an external catalog unless you have the web endpoint set in the **Web endpoint** section in the left pane.

### Try it out

1. Select **Train** and wait for training completion.

1. Once, training completes, select **Test** and try a few interactions.

    * Input: turn on
    * Output: Which device do you want to control?
    * Input: lights
    * Output: Ok, turning the lights on

> [!NOTE]
>Notice how you can control all the devices hosted on the web endpoint now. You still need to train the application for testing out the new changes and re-publish the application.


## Add validation to parameters
In this section, you will add validations to parameters and prompts for correction.
**Validations** are constructs applicable to certain parameter types which let user configure constraints on parameter's value. For full list of parameter types extending the validation construct, go to [references](./custom-commands-references.md)

Let's demonstrate validations using **SetTemperature** command. You will be adding a validation for the **Temperature** parameter.

1. Select **SetTemperature** command in the left pane.
1. Select  **Temperature** in the middle pane.
1. Select **Add a validation** present in the right pane.
1. In the **New validation** window, configure validation as follows, and select **Create**.


    | Parameter Configuration         | Suggested value                                          | Description                                                                        |
    | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Min Value        | `60`               | For Number parameters, the minimum value this parameter can assume |
    | Max Value        | `80`               | For Number parameters, the maximum value this parameter can assume |
    | Failure response |  Simple editor > First Variation > `Sorry, I can only set temperature between 60 and 80 degrees`      | Prompt to ask for a new value if the validation fails                                       |

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add a range validation](media/custom-commands/add-validations-temperature.png)



### Try it out
1. Select **Train** icon present on top of the right pane.

1. Once, training completes, select **Test** and try a few interactions:

    - Input: Set the temperature to 72 degrees
    - Output: Ok, setting temperature to 72 degrees
    - Input: Set the temperature to 45 degrees
    - Output: Sorry, I can only set temperature between 60 and 80 degrees
    - Input: make it 72 degrees instead
    - Output: Ok, setting temperature to 72 degrees
