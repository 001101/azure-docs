# Quickstart: Recognize speech in JavaScript in Node.js using the Speech Service SDK

[!INCLUDE [Selector](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-selector.md)]

In this article, you'll learn how to create a Node.js project using the JavaScript binding of the Cognitive Services Speech SDK to transcribe speech to text.
The application is based on the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK ([Download version 1.1.0](https://aka.ms/csspeech/jsbrowserpackage)).

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the Speech Service for free](get-started.md).
* A PC or Mac.
* A text editor.
* A current version of Node.js.

## Create a new project folder

Create a new, empty folder. In case you want to host the sample on a web server, make sure that the web server can access the folder.

Init the folder by issuing

```nodejs
npm init
```

and follow the steps to create a npm module.

## Install the Speech SDK for JavaScript into that folder

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

Add the Speech SDK via `npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk`.

This will download and install the latest version of the Speech SDK from npmjs to your folder and install it in the `node_modules\microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk` directory. In addition, it will download and install any prerequisite package, as needed.

As an alternative, you can download the installation package from TBD and install it from your local directory via `npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk-1.2.0.tgz`.

## Using the Speech SDK

Create a new file in the folder, named `index.js` and open this file with a text editor.

1. Create the following JavaScript skeleton:

  ```javascript
"use strict";
  ```

2. Add a reference to the Speech SDK

  <!-- [!code-html[](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/js-browser/index.html#speechsdkref)] -->

  ```javascript
var sdk = require("microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk");
  ```

3. Load the file content and prepare a PushStream.

Please note that the Speech SDK does not support a microphone in Node.js nor does it (currently) support the File data type.
Both is only supported on browsers. Instead, use the Stream interface to the Speech SDK, either through
PullStream() or PushStream() support.

In this example, we will use the PushStream() interface.

  ```javascript
var fs = require("fs"); // provides access to the file system

var filename = "YOUR_WAVE_FILENAME.wav"; // Please note, 16000Hz, Mono support only.
var fileContents = fs.readFileSync(filename);
var arrayBuffer = Uint8Array.from(fileContents).buffer;

var p = sdk.AudioInputStream.createPushStream();
p.write(arrayBuffer);
p.close();
  ```

4. Perform the recognition.

  ```javascript
var audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromStreamInput(p);
var speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION", "YOUR_REGIOM");

var recognizer = new sdk.SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

recognizer.recognizeOnceAsync(
    function (result) {
      console.log(result);

      recognizer.close();
      recognizer = undefined;
    },
    function (err) {
      console.trace("err - " + err);

      recognizer.close();
      recognizer = undefined;
    });
  ```

## Running the sample

To launch the app, adapt the subscription, region, and wave filename and then run it by executing

```nodejs
node index.js
```

It will trigger a recognition using the provided filename and present the output on the console.

Here is a sample output of running main.java after updating the subscription data.

```json
SpeechRecognitionResult {
  privResultId: '9E30EEBD41AC4571BB77CF9164441F46',
  privReason: 3,
  privText: 'What\'s the weather like?',
  privDuration: 15900000,
  privOffset: 300000,
  privErrorDetails: undefined,
  privJson: '{"RecognitionStatus":"Success","DisplayText":"What\'s the weather like?","Offset":300000,"Duration":15900000}',
  privProperties: undefined }
```
