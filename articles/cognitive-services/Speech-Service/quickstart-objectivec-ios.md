# Quickstart: Recognize speech in Objective C on iOS using the Cognitive Services Speech SDK

[!INCLUDE [Selector](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-quickstart-selector.md)]

In this article, you learn how to create an iOS app in Objective C using the Cognitive Services Speech SDK to transcribe an audio file with recorded speech to text.

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](get-started.md).
* A Mac to run XCode as iOS development environment.

## Install XCode

TODO

## Get the Speech SDK for iOS

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

The current version of the Cognitive Services Speech SDK is `0.6.0`.

DRAFT: The Cognitive Services Speech SDK for Mac and iOS can be downloaded as a zip-file from https://aka.ms/csspeech/macbinary. Download and copy the files to the `speechsdk` subdirectory in your home directory.


## Create an XCode Project 

In the template selection dialog, choose the "iOS Single View App" template

In the following dialogs, make the following selections:

1. App Info Screen
  	1. Enter a name for the quickstart app, for example `SpeechQuickstart`
	1. Enter an organization name such as `TestOrg`
	1. Disable all tests for this example project
1. Select source root directory
	1. Choose your home directory to put the project files in
	1. Disable the creation of a git repo for this example project
1. Adjust the paths to the SDK in the *Project Settings*
	1. Add the SDK library as a framework: `Add framework -> Add other… -> Navigate to the directory containing the library`
	1. Add the path to SDK headers to the *header search path* (`$(SRCROOT)/../speechsdk/source/bindings/objective-c/public`)
	1. Add the path to the directory containing the library to the *library search path* (`$(SRCROOT)/../speechsdk/build_ios_simulator_debug/lib`)
	1. Add the path to the directory containing the library to the *Runpath search path* (`$(SRCROOT)/../speechsdk/build_ios_simulator_debug/lib`)

## Add the sample code

1. Replace the contents of the autogenerated file `main.m` by:

TODO adapt link

  [!code-cpp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/cpp-linux/helloworld.cpp#code)]

1. Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

TODO download and add the wav file to the project

## Building and Running the Sample

1. Make the debug output visible (`View -> Debug Area -> Activate Console`).
1. Build and run the example code by selecting `Product -> Run` from the menu or clicking the "Play" button.
1. Verify that the debug output contains intermediate and a final speech recognition result.



[!INCLUDE [Download the sample](../../../includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-speech-sdk-sample-download-h2.md)]
Look for this sample in the `quickstart/objectivec-ios` folder.
