# Quickstart: Speech SDK for C++ (Windows) platform setup

This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) for C++ on Windows Desktop.

In this article, you create a C++ console application for Windows. You use the Cognitive Services [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md) to transcribe speech to text in real time from your PC's microphone. The application is built with the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (any edition).
