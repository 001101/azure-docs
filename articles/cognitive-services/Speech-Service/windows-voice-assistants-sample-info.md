# The UWP Voice Assistant sample

The UWP Voice Assistant sample is a voice assistant on Windows that serves to

- demonstrate the use of the Windows ConversationalAgent APIs
- display best practices for a voice agent on Windows
- provide an adaptable app and reusable components for your MVP agent application
- show how Direct Line Speech, along with Bot Framework or Custom Commands, can be used together with the Windows ConversationalAgent APIs for an end-to-end voice agent experience

The documentation provided with the sample app walks through the code path of voice activation and agent management, from the prerequisites of startup through proper cleanup.
