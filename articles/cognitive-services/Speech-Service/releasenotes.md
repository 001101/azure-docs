# Release Notes

## Cognitive Services Speech SDK 0.4.0 - Release 2018-June

**Functional Changes**

- AudioInputStream

  A recognizer can now consume a stream as the audio source. For detailed information, see the [documentation](https://aka.ms/csspeech) under the section **How-to guides**.
	
- Detailed Output Format

  While creating a `SpeechRecognizer`, you can request `Detailed` or `Simple` output format. The `DetailedSpeechRecognitionResult` contains a confidence score, recognized text, raw lexical form, normalized form, and normalized form with masked profanity.
	
- Change to `SpeechRecognitionResult.text` from `SpeechRecognitionResult.RecongizedText` in C# and Java (for the Speech DDK).
	
**Bug fixes**

- Fix a possible callback issue in USP layer during shutdown.
	
- If a recognizer consumed an audio input file, it was holding on to the file handle longer than necessary.
	
- Removed several deadlocks between message pump and recognizer.
	
- Fire a `nomatch` result when the response from service is timed out.
	
- The media foundation libraries on Windows are delay-loaded. This library is only required for microphone input.
	
- The upload speed for audio data is limited to about twice the original audio speed. 
	
- File name changes (casing changes) for the java binding library (for the speech DDK).
	
- On Windows, C# .NET assemblies are now strong-named.
	
- Documentation fix

  `Region` is required information to create a recognizer.
	
More samples have been added and are constantly being updated. For the latest set of samples, see the [Speech SDK Sample GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/csspeech/samples).
