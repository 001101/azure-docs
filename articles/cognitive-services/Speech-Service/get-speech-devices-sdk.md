# Get the Speech Devices SDK

## Requesting access

The Speech Devices SDK is in restricted preview and requires you to be accepted into the program. Currently, Microsoft prefers large companies as candidates for access to this product.

To get access to the Speech Devices SDK, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Microsoft Speech Devices SDK [sign-up form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872620).
1. Read the [license agreement](speech-devices-sdk-license.md).
1. If you agree to the terms of this license agreement, choose "I agree."
1. Answer the rest of the questions.
1. Submit the form. 
1. If your email address is not already part of the Azure Active Directory, you will receive an invitation email like the one below upon approval. If your email address is already in the Azure Active Directory, you will receive an email message from the Microsoft Speech team upon approval and may skip ahead to [Downloading the Speech Devices SDK](#downloading-the-speech-devices-sdk).
