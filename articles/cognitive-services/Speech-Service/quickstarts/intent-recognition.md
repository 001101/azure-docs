# Recognize Intents usig speech

In this quickstart you will use the [Speech SDK](https://aka.ms/ignite2019/speech/placeholder) to interactively recognize speech from audio data captured from a microphone. After satisfying a few prerequisites, recognizing speech from a microphone takes only four steps:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a ````SpeechConfig```` object from your subscription key and region.
> * Create a ````IntentRecognizer```` object using the ````SpeechConfig```` object from above.
> * Using the ````IntentRecognizer```` object, start the recognition process for a single utterance.
> * Inspect the ````IntentRecognitionResult```` returned.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

1. [Create a LUIS application and get an endpoint key](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/quickstarts/create-luis.md)
2. [Setup your development environment](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=dotnet%2CWindows%2Cjre). Use this quickstart to install and configure Visual Studio 2019.
3. [Created an empty sample project](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/quickstarts/create-project.md?tabs=dotnet%2CWindows%2Cjre)
