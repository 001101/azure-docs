In this quickstart you'll use the Speech SDK to convert speech-to-text using a microphone. Regardless of your language/platform preference, there are a few things that you'll do as you work your way through this article:

1. Consume the Speech SDK.
2. Create a configuration that takes your subscription key and region as arguments.
3. Recognize speech and display the recognition results (or errors).

Let's write some code!
