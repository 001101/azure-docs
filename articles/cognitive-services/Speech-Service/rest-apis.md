# Speech service REST APIs

The REST APIs of the unified Speech service are similar to the APIs provided by the [Speech service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/Speech) (formerly known as the Bing Speech Service) and the [Translator Speech service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator-speech/). In general, only the endpoints used differ.

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech Translation feature does not have a REST API. See [WebSocket protocols](websockets.md).

## Speech to Text API

In the Speech to Text API, only the endpoints used differ from the previous Speech service Speech Recognition API. Use the one that is appropriate to your subscription. The new endpoints are shown in the table below.

TODO new endpoints needed

Keep these differences in mind as you read the [REST API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech/getstarted/getstartedrest) for the Speech service.

The Speech to Text API also supports a [WebSockets protocol](websockets.md) for streaming speech recognition.

## Text to Speech API

In the Text to Speech API, the `X-Microsoft-OutputFormat` parameter now takes the following values.

Value|Meaning
-|-
1| raw-16khz-16bit-mono-pcm 
2| audio-16khz-16kbps-mono-siren 
3| riff-16khz-16kbps-mono-siren 
4| riff-16khz-16bit-mono-pcm 
5| audio-16khz-128kbitrate-mono-mp3 
6| audio-16khz-64kbitrate-mono-mp3 
7| audio-16khz-32kbitrate-mono-mp3
9|  raw-24khz-16bit-mono-pcm
10| riff-24khz-16bit-mono-pcm
11| audio-24khz-160kbitrate-mono-mp3
12| audio-24khz-96kbitrate-mono-mp3
13| audio-24khz-48kbitrate-mono-mp3

The service now includes two new voices:

Locale | Language | Gender  | Service name mapping
-------|-----------|--------|------------
en-US | US English | Male   | "Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, Jessa24kRUS)" 
en-US | US English | Female | "Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, Guy24kRUS)"

The following are the REST endpoints for the unified Speech service Text to Speech API. Use the one that is appropriate to your subscription.

Region|	Endpoint
-|-
West US|	https://westus.tts.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1
East Asia|	https://eastasia.tts.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1
North Europe|	https://northeurope.tts.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1

Keep these differences in mind as you refer to the [REST API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech/api-reference-rest/bingvoiceoutput) for the Speech service.
