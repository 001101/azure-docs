# Use language generation templates for speech responses

In this article, you will learn about the language generation aspects of speech responses. This can be achieved in two ways-
1. Use of language generation templates.
1. Use of adaptive expressions.

## Prerequisites

You must have completed the steps in the following articles:

## Language generation templates overview

Custom Commands' templates are based on the BotFramework's [LG templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/file-format/bot-builder-lg-file-format?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#templates).

Since Custom Commands creates a new LG template when required (i.e. for speech responses in parameters or actions) you do not have to specify the name of the LG template, i.e. instead of defining your template as.

 ```
    # CompletionAction
    - Ok, turning {OnOff} the {SubjectDevice}
    - Done, turning {OnOff} the {SubjectDevice}
    - Proceeding to turn {OnOff} {SubjectDevice}
 ```

You only need to define the body of the template without the name, i.e.

![template editor example](./media/custom-speech-commands/template-editor-example.png)

Taking advantage of LG templates we can define complex speech responses for our commands, i.e.

![advanced template editor example](./media/custom-speech-commands/advanced-template-editor-example.png)

You can refer to the [LG templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/file-format/bot-builder-lg-file-format?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#templates) documentation for more examples, just keep in mind the following restrictions.

1. In the LG templates entities are represented as ${entityName}, in Custom Commands we don't use entities but parameters can be used as variables with either one of these representations ${parameterName} or {parameterName}
1. Template composition and expansion is not supported in Custom Commands.
1. Functions injected by LG  is not supported in Custom Commands.
1. Options (strict, replaceNull & lineBreakStyle) are not supported in Custom Commands.

## Add template responses to TurnOnOff command
Template editor is used to introduce variation to the speech responses being sent to the client.

1. Let's go back to **TurnOnOff** command. Edit the **Actions** section of existing completion rule **ConfirmationResponse**.
1. In the **Edit action** pop-up, switch to **Template Editor** and replace the text with-

    ```
    - Ok, turning {OnOff} the {SubjectDevice}
    - Done, turning {OnOff} the {SubjectDevice}
    - Proceeding to turn {OnOff} {SubjectDevice}
    ```

1. **Train** and **Test** your application
    * Input: turn on the tv
    * Output: Ok, turning on the tv
    * Input: turn on the tv
    * Output: Done, turning on the tv
    * Input: turn on the tv
    * Output: Proceeding to turn on the tv


## Add adaptive expressions to SetAlarms command
1. For this, let's use the **FallbackCommand**. Select the command in the left pane.
1. Modify the **DefaultResponse** completion rules and change the existing action to **Send speech response > hi {getTimeOfDay(utcNow())}**

1. **Train** and **Test** your application
    * Input: hi
    * Output: hi morning
