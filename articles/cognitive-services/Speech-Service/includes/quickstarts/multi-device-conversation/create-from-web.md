1. You'll need to create a conversation that you can join:
    1. Launch your browser and navigate to: <https://translator.microsoft.com/>.
    1. Click on "Start conversation".
    1. Sign in using any of the available options.
    1. Type in a name (e.g. The host).
    1. Select a language (e.g. English).
    1. Click on "Enter".
    1. Note the conversation code at the top of the page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the copy button on the web page, make sure you remove the `translate.it/` at the start. You only need the 5 character conversation ID (example: ABCDE).
