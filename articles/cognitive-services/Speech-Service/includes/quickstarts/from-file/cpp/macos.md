## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=macos)
> * [Create an empty sample project](../../../../quickstarts/create-project.md?tabs=macos)

## Install Speech SDK

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

The Speech SDK for macOS can be downloaded as a zipped framework bundle from https://aka.ms/csspeech/macosbinary.

Download and install the SDK as follows:

1. Choose a directory to which the Speech SDK files should be extracted, and set the `SPEECHSDK_ROOT` environment variable to point to that directory. This variable makes it easy to refer to the directory in future commands. For example, if you want to use the directory `speechsdk` in your home directory, use a command like the following:

   ```sh
   export SPEECHSDK_ROOT="$HOME/speechsdk"
   ```

1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet.

   ```sh
   mkdir -p "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

1. Download and extract the `.zip` archive containing the Speech SDK framework:

   ```sh
   wget -O SpeechSDK-macOS.zip https://aka.ms/csspeech/macosbinary
   unzip SpeechSDK-macOS.zip -d "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

1. Validate the contents of the top-level directory of the extracted package:

   ```sh
   ls -l "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

   The directory listing should contain the third-party notice and license files, as well as a `MicrosoftCognitiveServicesSpeech.framework` directory.

## Add sample code

1. Create a C++ source file named `helloworld.cpp`, and paste the following code into it.

   ````C++

   // TODO INSERT C++ CODE HERE... Copy from "from-microphone", and paste directly here, adding AudioConfig/file name portion

   ````

1. In this new file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech Services subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

## Build the app

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to enter the commands below as a _single command line_. The easiest way to do that is to copy the command by using the **Copy** button next to each command, and then paste it at your shell prompt.

* Run the following command to build the application.

  ```sh
  g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld --std=c++14 -F${SPEECHSDK_ROOT} -framework MicrosoftCognitiveServicesSpeech
  ```

## Run the app

1. Configure the loader's library path to point to the Speech SDK library.

    ```sh
    export DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH="$DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
    ```

1. Run the application.

   ```sh
   ./helloworld
   ```

1. When prompted, enter the name of your .WAV file and press ENTER.

   ```text
   Enter filename: whatstheweatherlike.wav
   ```

1. Your audio file is transmitted to the Speech Services and the first utterance in the file is transcribed to text, which appears in the same window.

   ```text
   Enter filename: whatstheweatherlike.wav

   Recognizing first result...
   We recognized: What's the weather like?
   ```
