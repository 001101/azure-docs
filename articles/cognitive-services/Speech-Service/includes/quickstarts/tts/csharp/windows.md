## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you'll need:

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
* A subscription key for the Speech Service. [Get one for free](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/get-started.md).
* A speaker (or headset) available.

## Create a Visual Studio project

[!INCLUDE [Create project](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-create-speech-project-vs-csharp.md)]

## Add sample code

1. Open **Program.cs** and replace the automatically generated code with this sample:

   [!code-csharp[Quickstart Code](~/samples-cognitive-services-speech-sdk/quickstart/text-to-speech/csharp-dotnet-windows/helloworld/Program.cs#code)]

1. Find the string `YourSubscriptionKey`, and replace it with your Speech Services subscription key.

1. Find the string `YourServiceRegion`, and replace it with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription. For example, if you're using the free trial subscription, the region is `westus`.

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **Save All**.

## Build and run the application

1. From the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the application. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or select **F5**) to start the **helloworld** application.

1. Enter an English phrase or sentence. The application transmits your text to the Speech Services, which sends synthesized speech to the application to play on your speaker.
