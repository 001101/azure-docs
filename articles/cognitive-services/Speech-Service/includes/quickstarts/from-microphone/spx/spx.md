## Build and run app

Now you're ready to test the app, and verify the speech recognition functionality using the Speech service.

1. **Start your app** - From the command line, type:
    ```bash
    python quickstart.py
    ```
2. **Start recognition** - It will prompt you to speak a phrase in English. Your speech is sent to the Speech service, transcribed as text, and rendered in the console.
