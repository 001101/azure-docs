In this quickstart you will use the [Speech SDK](https://aka.ms/speech/sdk) to interactively recognize speech from audio data captured from a microphone. After satisfying a few prerequisites, recognizing speech from a microphone takes only four steps:
1. Create a ````SpeechConfig```` object from your subscription key and region.
2. Create a ````SpeechRecognizer```` object using the ````SpeechConfig```` object from above.
3. Using the ````SpeechRecognizer```` object, start the recognition process for a single utterance.
4. Inspect the ````SpeechRecognitionResult```` returned.
