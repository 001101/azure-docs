# [Windows](#tab/windows)

> [!WARNING]
> The Speech SDK supports Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, or later versions. Earlier versions are **not supported**.

The Speech SDK requires the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> on the system.

- <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe" target="_blank">Install for x86 <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a>
- <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe" target="_blank">Install for x64 <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a>
- <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.arm64.exe" target="_blank">Install for ARMx64 <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a>

For microphone input, the Media Foundation libraries must be installed. These libraries are part of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. It's possible to use the Speech SDK without these libraries, as long as a microphone isn't used as the audio input device.

The required Speech SDK files can be deployed in the same directory as your application. This way your application can directly access the libraries. Make sure you select the correct version (x86/x64) that matches your application.

| Name                                            | Function                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core.dll`   | Core SDK, required for native and managed deployment |
| `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.csharp.dll` | Required for managed deployment                      |

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with the release 1.3.0 the file `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.csharp.bindings.dll` (shipped in previous releases) isn't needed anymore. The functionality is now integrated in the core SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> For the Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) C# project, make sure the libraries are included in your project's deployment settings. You can check this under `Properties -> Publish Section`. Click the `Application Files` button and find corresponding libraries from the scroll down list. Make sure the value is set to `Included`. Visual Studio will include the file when project is published/deployed.

For Windows, we support the following languages:

* C# (UWP and .NET), C++:
  You can reference and use the latest version of our Speech SDK NuGet package. The package includes 32-bit and 64-bit client libraries and managed (.NET) libraries. The SDK can be installed in Visual Studio by using NuGet, [Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech).

* Java:
  You can reference and use the latest version of our Speech SDK Maven package, which supports only Windows x64. In your Maven project, add `https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/` as an additional repository and reference `com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk:1.8.0` as a dependency.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, we only support Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, and CentOS 8 on the following target architectures:
> - x86 (Debian/Ubuntu), x64, ARM32 (Debian/Ubuntu), and ARM64 (Debian/Ubuntu) for C++ development
> - x64, ARM32 (Debian/Ubuntu), and ARM64 (Debian/Ubuntu) for Java
> - x64 for .NET Core and Python

Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running the following shell commands:

On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0 libasound2
```

On Debian 9:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.2 libasound2
```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```sh
sudo yum update
sudo yum install alsa-lib openssl
```

> [!NOTE]
> On RHEL/CentOS 8, follow the instructions on [how to configure OpenSSL for Linux](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).

* C#:
  You can reference and use the latest version of our Speech SDK NuGet package. To reference the SDK, add the following package reference to your project:

  ```xml
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech" Version="1.8.0" />
  ```

* Java:
  You can reference and use the latest version of our Speech SDK Maven package. In your Maven project, add `https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/` as an additional repository and reference `com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk:1.7.0` as a dependency.

* C++: Download the SDK as a [.tar package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary) and unpack the files in a directory of your choice. The following table shows the SDK folder structure:

  | Path                   | Description                                          |
  |------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
  | `license.md`           | License                                              |
  | `ThirdPartyNotices.md` | Third-party notices                                  |
  | `include`              | Header files for C++                                 |
  | `lib/x64`              | Native x64 library for linking with your application |
  | `lib/x86`              | Native x86 library for linking with your application |

  To create an application, copy or move the required binaries (and libraries) into your development environment. Include them as required in your build process.

The Speech SDK currently supports the Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9, RHEL 8, CentOS 8 distributions.
For a native application, you need to ship the Speech SDK library, `libMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core.so`.
Make sure you select the version (x86, x64) that matches your application. Depending on the Linux version, you also might need to include the following dependencies:

- The shared libraries of the GNU C library (including the POSIX Threads Programming library, `libpthreads`)
- The OpenSSL library (`libssl.so.1.0.0` or `libssl.so.1.0.2`)
- The shared library for ALSA applications (`libasound.so.2`)


> [!NOTE]
> On RHEL/CentOS 8, follow the instructions on [how to configure OpenSSL for Linux](../how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).

The Java SDK for Android is packaged as an [AAR (Android Library)](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), which includes the necessary libraries and required Android permissions. It's hosted in a Maven repository at `https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/` as package `com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk:1.7.0`.

To consume the package from your Android Studio project, make the following changes:

* In the project-level build.gradle file, add the following to the `repository` section:

  ```gradle
  maven { url 'https://csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/' }
  ```

* In the module-level build.gradle file, add the following to the `dependencies` section:

  ```gradle
  implementation 'com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech:client-sdk:1.10.0'
  ```

The Java SDK is also part of the [Speech Devices SDK](../speech-devices-sdk.md).
