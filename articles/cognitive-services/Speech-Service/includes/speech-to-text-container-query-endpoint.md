### Speech-to-text or Custom Speech-to-text

The container provides websocket-based query endpoint APIs, that are accessed through the [Speech SDK](../index.yml). By default, the Speech SDK uses online speech services. To use the container, you need to change the initialization method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The resource subscription key and authentication token are not needed when use containers.

See the examples below.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

Change from using this Azure-cloud initialization call:

```csharp
var config = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");
```

to this call using the container endpoint:

```csharp
var config = SpeechConfig.FromEndpoint(
    new Uri("ws://localhost:5000/speech/recognition/dictation/cognitiveservices/v1"));
```
# [Python](#tab/python)

Change from using this Azure-cloud initialization call:

```python
speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(
    subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)
```

to this call using the container endpoint:

```python
speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(
    endpoint="ws://localhost:5000/speech/recognition/dictation/cognitiveservices/v1")
```
