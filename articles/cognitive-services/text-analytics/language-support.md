#### [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](#tab/named-entity-recognition)

> [!NOTE]
> * NER v3 currently only supports the English language. If you call NER v3 with a different language, the API will return v2.1 results, provided the language is supported in version 2.1.
> * v2.1 only returns the full set of available entities for the English, Chinese-Simplified, French, German, and Spanish languages.  The "Person", "Location" and "Organization" entities are returned for the other supported languages.

#### [Language Detection](#tab/language-detection)

The Text Analytics API can detect a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages.  Language Detection returns the "script" of a language. For instance, for the phrase "I have a dog" it will return  `en` instead of  `en-US`. The only special case is Chinese, where the language detection capability will return `zh_CHS` or `zh_CHT` if it can determine the script given the text provided. In situations where a specific script cannot be identified for a Chinese document, it will return simply `zh`.

We don't publish the exact list of languages for this feature, but it can detect a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages. 

If you have content expressed in a less frequently used language, you can try Language Detection to see if it returns a code. The response for languages that cannot be detected is `unknown`.
