# Quickstart: [Product Name] client library for Python
<a name="HOLTop"></a>

Get started with the Text Analytics client library for Python. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks. 

Use the Text Analytics client library for Python to perform:

* Sentiment analysis
* Language detection
* Entity recognition
* Key phrase extraction


[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/cognitiveservices/textanalytics?view=azure-python) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics) | [Package (PiPy)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples/)


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)

## Setting up

### Create a Text Analytics Azure resource

Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for [Product name] using the [Azure portal](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) or [Azure CLI](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for 7 days for free. After signing up it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

After you get a key from your trial subscription or resource, [create an environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key, named `TEXTANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.

### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics
```

### Create a new python application

Create a new Python application in your preferred editor or IDE. Then import the following libraries.

[!code-python[import declarations](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=imports)]

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and key. If you created the environment variable after you launched the application, you will need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell running it to access the variable.

[!code-python[initial variables](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=key-and-endpoint)]


## Object model

TBD

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following with the Text Analytics client library for Python:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis)
* [Language detection](#language-detection)
* [Entity recognition](#entity-recognition)
* [Key phrase extraction](#key-phrase-extraction)

## Authenticate the client

Create a new `TextAnalyticsClient` object with `credentials` and `text_analytics_url` as a parameter. Use the correct Azure region for your Text Analytics subscription (for example `westcentralus`).

[!code-python[client creation and auth](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=client)]

## Sentiment analysis

The payload to the API consists of a list of `documents`, which are dictionaries containing an `id` and a `text` attribute. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed, and the `id` can be any value. 

Call the `sentiment()` function and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and sentiment score. A score closer to 0 indicates a negative sentiment, while a score closer to 1 indicates a positive sentiment.

[!code-python[Sentiment analysis](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=sentiment-analysis)]


### Output

```console
Document Id:  1 , Sentiment Score:  0.87
Document Id:  2 , Sentiment Score:  0.11
Document Id:  3 , Sentiment Score:  0.44
Document Id:  4 , Sentiment Score:  1.00
```

## Language detection

Create a list of dictionaries, each containing the document you want to analyze. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed, and the `id` can be any value. 

Using the client created earlier, call `detect_language()` and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and the first returned language.

[!code-python[Language detection](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=language-detection)]

### Output

```console
Document Id:  1 , Language:  English
Document Id:  2 , Language:  Spanish
Document Id:  3 , Language:  Chinese_Simplified
```

## Entity recognition

Create a list of dictionaries, containing the documents you want to analyze. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed, and the `id` can be any value. 

Using the client created earlier, call `entities()` function and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and the entities contained in it.

[!code-python[Entity recognition](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=entity-recognition)]

### Output

```console
Document Id:  1
	Key Entities:
		 NAME:  Microsoft 	Type:  Organization 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  0 	Length:  9 	Score:  1.00
		 NAME:  Bill Gates 	Type:  Person 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  25 	Length:  10 	Score:  1.00
		 NAME:  Paul Allen 	Type:  Person 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  40 	Length:  10 	Score:  1.00
		 NAME:  April 4 	Type:  Other 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  54 	Length:  7 	Score:  0.80
		 NAME:  April 4, 1975 	Type:  DateTime 	Sub-type:  Date
			Offset:  54 	Length:  13 	Score:  0.80
		 NAME:  BASIC 	Type:  Other 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  89 	Length:  5 	Score:  0.80
		 NAME:  Altair 8800 	Type:  Other 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  116 	Length:  11 	Score:  0.80
Document Id:  2
	Key Entities:
		 NAME:  Microsoft 	Type:  Organization 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  21 	Length:  9 	Score:  1.00
		 NAME:  Redmond (Washington) 	Type:  Location 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  60 	Length:  7 	Score:  0.99
		 NAME:  21 kilómetros 	Type:  Quantity 	Sub-type:  Dimension
			Offset:  71 	Length:  13 	Score:  0.80
		 NAME:  Seattle 	Type:  Location 	Sub-type:  None
			Offset:  88 	Length:  7 	Score:  1.00
```

## Key phrase extraction

Create a list of dictionaries, containing the documents you want to analyze. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed, and the `id` can be any value. 

Using the client created earlier, call `key_phrases()` function and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and the key phrases contained in it.

[!code-python[Key phrase extraction](~/samples-cognitive-services-python-sdk/samples/language/text_analytics_samples.py?name=key-phrases)]

### Output

```console
Document Id:  1
	Phrases:
		 幸せ
Document Id:  2
	Phrases:
		 Stuttgart
		 Hotel
		 Fahrt
		 Fu
Document Id:  3
	Phrases:
		 cat
		 veterinarian
Document Id:  4
	Phrases:
		 fútbol
```
