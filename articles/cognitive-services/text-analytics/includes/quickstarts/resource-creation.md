Start using the Text Analytics API by creating one of the Azure resources below.

* A [trial resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#lang) (no Azure subscription needed): 
    * Valid for seven days, for free. After signing up, a trial key and endpoint will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/). 
    * This is a great option if you want to try the Text Analytics API, but donâ€™t have an Azure subscription.

* A [Text Analytics resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics):
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
    * Use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

* A [Multi-Service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne):
    * Available through the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroupBlade) until you delete the resource.  
    * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Cognitive Services.
