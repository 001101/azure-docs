* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Text Analytics resource"  target="_blank">create a Text Analytics resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. 
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Text Analytics API. 
    * You can use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
