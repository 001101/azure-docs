* Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [Text Analytics resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint.

    * You can use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
