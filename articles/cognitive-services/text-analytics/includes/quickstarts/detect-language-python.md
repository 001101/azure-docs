[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/cognitiveservices/textanalytics?view=azure-python) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics) | [Package (PiPy)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples/)


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)

## Setting up

### Create a Text Analytics Azure resource

Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for Text Analytics using the [Azure portal](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) or [Azure CLI](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for 7 days for free. After signing up it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

After you get a key from your trial subscription or resource, [create an environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key, named `TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.

### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics
```

### Create a new python application

Create a new Python application in your preferred editor or IDE. Then import the following libraries.

```python
from azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials
```

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and subscription key. Obtain these values from the environment variables TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY and TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT. If you created these environment variables after you began editing the application, you will need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell you are using to access the variables.

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-find-resource-information](../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```python
import os

key_var_name = 'TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY'
if not key_var_name in os.environ:
    raise Exception('Please set/export the environment variable: {}'.format(key_var_name))
subscription_key = os.environ[key_var_name]

endpoint_var_name = 'TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT'
if not endpoint_var_name in os.environ:
    raise Exception('Please set/export the environment variable: {}'.format(endpoint_var_name))
endpoint = os.environ[endpoint_var_name]

credentials = CognitiveServicesCredentials(subscription_key)
```

## Object model

The Text Analytics client is a [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics.textanalyticsclient?view=azure-python) object that authenticates to Azure using your key. The client provides several methods for analyzing text, as a single string, or a batch. 

Text is sent to the API as a list of `documents`, which are `dictionary` objects containing a combination of `id`, `text`, and `language` attributes depending on the method used. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed in the origin `language`, and the `id` can be any value. 

The response object is a list containing the analysis information for each document. 

## Authenticate the client

Create a new [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics.textanalyticsclient?view=azure-python) object with `credentials` and `text_analytics_url` as a parameter. Use the correct Azure region for your Text Analytics subscription (for example `westcentralus`).

```python
text_analytics = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint=text_analytics_url, credentials=credentials)
```

## Language detection

Using the client created earlier, call [detect_language()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics/azure.cognitiveservices.language.textanalytics.textanalyticsclient?view=azure-python#detect-language-show-stats-none--documents-none--custom-headers-none--raw-false----operation-config-) and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and the first returned language.

```python
documents = [
    {
        'id': '1',
        'text': 'This is a document written in English.'
    }
]
response = text_analytics.detect_language(documents=documents)
for document in response.documents:
    print("Document Id: ", document.id, ", Language: ",
          document.detected_languages[0].name)
```

### Output

```console
Document Id:  1 , Language:  English
```
