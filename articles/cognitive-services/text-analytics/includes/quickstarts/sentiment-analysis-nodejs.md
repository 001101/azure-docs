## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Create a Text Analytics Azure resource

Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for Text analytics using the [Azure portal](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) or [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for 7 days for free. After signing up it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

After you get a key from your trial subscription or resource, [create an environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key, named `TEXTANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.

## Setting up

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

Create a file named `index.js` and import the following libraries:

```javascript
const CognitiveServicesCredentials = require("@azure/ms-rest-js");
const TextAnalyticsAPIClient = require("@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics");
```

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and subscription key. Obtain these values from the environment variables TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY and TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT. If you created these environment variables after you began editing the application, you will need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell you are using to access the variables.

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-find-resource-information](../find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
const key_var = 'TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY';
if (!process.env[key_var]) {
    throw new Error('please set/export the following environment variable: ' + key_var);
}
const subscription_key = process.env[key_var];

const endpoint_var = 'TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT';
if (!process.env[endpoint_var]) {
    throw new Error('please set/export the following environment variable: ' + endpoint_var);
}
const endpoint = process.env[endpoint_var];
```

### Install the client library

Install the `@azure/ms-rest-js` and `@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics` NPM packages:

```console
npm install @azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics @azure/ms-rest-js
```

Your app's `package.json` file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Object model

The Text Analytics client is a [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient?view=azure-node-latest) object that authenticates to Azure using your key. The client provides several methods for analyzing text, as a single string, or a batch.

Text is sent to the API as a list of `documents`, which are `dictionary` objects containing a combination of `id`, `text`, and `language` attributes depending on the method used. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed in the origin `language`, and the `id` can be any value. 

The response object is a list containing the analysis information for each document. 

## Authenticate the client

Create a new [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient?view=azure-node-latest) object with `credentials` and `endpoint` as a parameter.

```javascript
const creds = new CognitiveServicesCredentials.ApiKeyCredentials({ inHeader: { 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key } });
const client = new TextAnalyticsAPIClient.TextAnalyticsClient(creds, endpoint);
```

## Sentiment analysis

Create a list of objects, containing the documents you want to analyze.

```javascript
const inputDocuments = {documents:[
    {language:"en", id:"1", text:"I had the best day of my life."}
]}
```

Call `client.sentiment` and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and sentiment score. A score closer to 0 indicates a negative sentiment, while a score closer to 1 indicates a positive sentiment.

```javascript
const operation = client.sentiment({multiLanguageBatchInput: inputDocuments})
operation
.then(result => {
    console.log(result.documents);
})
.catch(err => {
    throw err;
});
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
[ { id: '1', score: 0.8723785877227783 } ]
```
