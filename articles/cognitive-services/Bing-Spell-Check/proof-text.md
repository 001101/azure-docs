# What is the Bing Spell Check API?

The Bing Spell Check API enables you to perform contextual grammar and spell checking on text. While most spell-checkers rely on dictionary-based rule sets, the Bing spell-checker leverages machine learning and statistical machine translation to provide accurate and contextual corrections. 

## Features


|Column1  |Column2  |
|---------|---------|
|Multiple spell check modes     | Multiple spell check modes enable you to get corrections focused on grammar and/or spelling. |
|Slang and informal language recognition     | Recognize common expressions and informal terms used in text.         |
|Differentiate between similar words     | Find the correct usage between words that sound similar but differ in meaning (for example, "see" and "sea")        |
|Brand, title, and popular usage support     | Recognize new brands, titles, and other popular expressions as they emerge |

## Workflow

The Bing Spell Check API is easy to call from any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON responses. The service is accessible using the REST API or the Bing Spell Check SDKs. 

1. Create a [Cognitive Services API account](../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) with access to the Bing Search APIs. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a free account. 
2. Send a request to the Bing Web Search API.
3. Parse the JSON response


## Spell check modes

The API supports two proofing modes, `Proof` and `Spell`.  Try examples [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/spell-check/).
### Proof - for documents scenario
The default mode is `Proof`. The `Proof` spelling mode provides the most comprehensive checks,  adding capitalization, basic punctuation, and other features to aid document creation. but it is available only in the en-US (English-United States), es-ES(Spanish), pt-BR(Portuguese) markets (Note: only in beta version for Spanish and Portuguese). For all other markets, set the mode query parameter to Spell. 
<br /><br/>**NOTE:**   If the length of query text exceeds 4096, it will be truncated to 4096 characters, then get processed. 
### Spell -  for web searches/queries scenario
`Spell` is more aggressive in order to return better search results. The `Spell` mode finds most spelling mistakes but doesn't find some of the grammar errors that `Proof` catches, for example, capitalization and repeated words.

> [!NOTE]
> * The maximum supported query length is below. If the query exceeds the max length, the query and its results will not be altered.
>    * 130 characters for the following language codes: en, de, es, fr, pl, pt, sv, ru, nl, nb, tr-tr, it, zh, ko. 
>    * 65 characters for all others.
> * The Spell mode does not support square bracket characters (`[` and `]`) in queries, and may cause inconsistent results. We recommend removing them from your queries when using the Spell mode.

## Market setting
Market needs to be specified in the query parameter in request URL, otherwise speller will take the default market based on IP address.


## POST vs. GET

The API supports either HTTP POST or HTTP GET. Which you use depends on the length of text you plan to proof. If the strings are always less than 1,500 characters, you'd use a GET. But if you want to support strings up to 10,000 characters, you'd use POST. The text string may include any valid UTF-8 character.

The following example shows a POST request to check the spelling and grammar of a text string. The example includes the [mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v7-reference#mode) query parameter for completeness (it could have been left out since `mode` defaults to Proof). The [text](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v7-reference#text) query parameter contains the string to be proofed.
  
```  
POST https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/spellcheck?mode=proof&mkt=en-us HTTP/1.1  
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
Content-Length: 47  
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 123456789ABCDE  
X-MSEdge-ClientIP: 999.999.999.999  
X-Search-Location: lat:47.60357;long:-122.3295;re:100  
X-MSEdge-ClientID: <blobFromPriorResponseGoesHere>  
Host: api.cognitive.microsoft.com  
 
text=when+its+your+turn+turn,+john,+come+runing  
``` 

If you use HTTP GET, you'd include the `text` query parameter in the URL's query string
  
The following shows the response to the previous request. The response contains a [SpellCheck](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v7-reference#spellcheck) object. 
  
```  
{  
    "_type" : "SpellCheck",  
    "flaggedTokens" : [{  
        "offset" : 5,  
        "token" : "its",  
        "type" : "UnknownToken",  
        "suggestions" : [{  
            "suggestion" : "it's",  
            "score" : 1  
        }]  
    },  
    {  
        "offset" : 25,  
        "token" : "john",  
        "type" : "UnknownToken",  
        "suggestions" : [{  
            "suggestion" : "John",  
            "score" : 1  
        }]  
    },  
    {  
        "offset" : 19,  
        "token" : "turn",  
        "type" : "RepeatedToken",  
        "suggestions" : [{  
            "suggestion" : "",  
            "score" : 1  
        }]  
    },  
    {  
        "offset" : 35,  
        "token" : "runing",  
        "type" : "UnknownToken",  
        "suggestions" : [{  
            "suggestion" : "running",  
            "score" : 1  
        }]  
    }]  
}  
```  
  
The [flaggedTokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v7-reference#flaggedtokens) field lists the spelling and grammar errors that the API found in the [text](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v7-reference#text) string. The `token` field contains the word to be replaced. You'd use the zero-based offset in the `offset` field to find the token in the `text` string. You'd then replace the word at that location with the word in the `suggestion` field. 

If the `type` field is RepeatedToken, you'd still replace the token with `suggestion` but you'd also likely need to remove the trailing space.

## Throttling requests

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-throttling-requests](../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-throttling-requests.md)]

## Next steps

To get started quickly with your first request, see [Making Your First Request](quickstarts/csharp.md).

Familiarize yourself with the [Bing Spell Check API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v7-reference). The reference contains the list of endpoints, headers, and query parameters that you'd use to request search results, and the definitions of the response objects. 

Be sure to read [Bing Use and Display Requirements](./useanddisplayrequirements.md) so you don't break any of the rules about using the results.
