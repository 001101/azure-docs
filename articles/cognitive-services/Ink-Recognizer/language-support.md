# Language and region support for the Ink Recognizer API

This article explains which languages are supported for the Ink Recognizer API

## Language list and status

Language support is initially rolled out in preview, graduating to generally available (GA) status, independently of each other and of the Text Analytics service overall. It's possible for languages to remain in preview, even while Text Analytics API transitions to generally available.

| Language    | Language code | Supported |
|:----------- |:-------------:|:---------:|
| English     | `en`          | ✔        | 
| ...     | `...`          | ✔        |
