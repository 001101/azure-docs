# Send ink data to the Ink Recognizer API 

Digital inking refers to the technologies that enable digital representation of input such as handwriting and drawings. This is typically achieved using a digitizer that captures the movements of input devices like styluses. As devices continue to enable rich digital inking experiences, artificial intelligence and machine learning enables the recognition of written shapes and text in any context.

The Ink Recognizer API enables you to send ink strokes and get detailed information about them. 

## Sending ink data to the API

The Ink Recognizer API is a stateless service that accepts ink strokes as a time-ordered set of 2D points (X,Y coordinates). The API uses these points to achieve detailed recognition for shapes and handwritten text. The accuracy and performance of its results can be impacted by:

* How your ink stroke data is prepared.
* The API parameters that were used.
* The number of data points in your API request.

Data points sent to the Anomaly Detector API must be formatted in JSON and have numerical X and Y values, like the example below

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "language": "en-US",
  "strokes": [
   {
    "id": 43,
    "points": 
        "5.1365, 12.3845,
        4.9534, 12.1301,
        4.8618, 12.1199,
        4.7906, 12.2217,
        4.7906, 12.5372,
        4.8211, 12.9849,
        4.9534, 13.6667,
        5.0958, 14.4503,
        5.3299, 15.2441,
        5.6555, 16.0480,
        ..."
   },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Recommended calling patterns

You can call the Ink Recognizer REST API in different patterns according to different scenarios. 

### User initiated API calls

If you're building an app that takes user input (for example, a notetaking or annotation app), you probably want to give them control of when and which ink gets sent to the Ink Recognizer API. This is especially useful when text and shapes are both present on the canvas, and users want to perform different actions for each. Consider adding shape selection features (like a lasso or rectangle selection tool), that enable users to choose what gets sent to the API.  

### App initiated API calls

You can also have your app call the Ink Recognizer API after a timeout. By sending the current ink strokes to the API routinely, you can store recognition results as they're created while reducing the API processing and response time. For example, you can send a line of handwritten text to the API after detecting your user has completed it. 

Having the recognition results in advance gives you information about the characteristics of ink strokes as they relate to each other - which strokes are grouped to form the same word, shape, list, or paragraph. This information can enhance the ink selection features in your app by being able to select groups of strokes at once, for exapmle.

## Integrate the Ink Recognizer API with Windows Ink

[Windows Ink](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/input/pen-and-stylus-interactions) provides tools and technologies to enable digital inking experiences on a diverse ecosystem of devices. You can combine the Windows Ink platform with the Ink Recognition API to create applications that display and interpret digital ink strokes.
