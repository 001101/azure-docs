# Quickstart: Get familiar with Content Moderator

This article will show you how to use the online Content Moderator Review Tool to test out the basic functionality of Content Moderator without having to write any code. If you wish to integrate this service into your app more quickly, see the other quickstarts in the [Next steps](#next-steps) section.

- [Subscribe to Content Moderator](#start-with-the-apis) in Azure to get the API key. Check out the [API reference](api-reference.md) and the [SDKs](sdk-and-samples.md#sdks-for-python-java-nodejs-and-net). You still need to sign up online to create a review team.
- [Use the Flow connector and templates](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_cognitiveservicescontentmoderator/content-moderator/) to check out a wide range of integrations with an easy-to-use designer.

Regardless of the option you choose, see the [Managing credentials](review-tool-user-guide/credentials.md) article to find your API credentials.

## Set up the review tool
The Content Moderator Review Tool is a web-based tool that allows human reviewers to aid the cognitive service in making the desired decision. In this guide, you will go through the short process of setting up the review tool so that you can see how the Content Moderator service works. Go to the [Content Moderator Review Tool](http://contentmoderator.cognitive.microsoft.com/) site and sign up.

Next, create a review team. You only need to give your team a name, but if you wish to invite your colleagues to the team, you can do so by entering their email addresses here.

Now you are ready to upload sample content.
Select **Try > Image**, **Try > Text**, or **Try > Video**.

Submit your content for moderation. Internally, the review tool will call the moderation APIs to scan your content. Once the scanning is complete, you'll see a message informing you that there are results waiting for your review.

Review the applied moderation tags. You can see which tags were applied to your content and what the score was in each category.

In a project, you or your review team can change these tags or add more as needed and submit these changes with the **Next** button. As your business application calls the Moderator APIs, the tagged content will queue up, ready to be reviewed by the human review teams. You can quickly review large volumes of content using this approach.

At this point, you have used the Content Moderator Review Tool to see examples of what the Content Moderator service can do. Next, you can either learn more about the review tool and how to integrate it into a software project using the Review APIs, or you can skip to the [Next steps](#next-steps) section to learn how to use the Moderation APIs themselves in your app.

## Learn more about the review tool

To learn more about how to use the Content Moderator Review Tool, take a look at the [Human-in-the-loop](Review-Tool-User-Guide/human-in-the-loop.md) guide, and see the Review Tool APIs to learn how to fine-tune the human review experience:
- The [Job API](try-review-api-job.md) scans your content by using the moderation APIs and generates reviews in the review tool. 
- The [Review API](try-review-api-review.md) directly creates image, text, or video reviews for human moderators without first scanning the content. 
- The [Workflow API](try-review-api-workflow.md) creates, updates, and gets details about the custom workflows that your team creates.

Or, continue with the next steps to get started using the Moderation APIs in your code.

## Next steps

Learn how to use the Moderation APIs themselves in your app.
- Implement image moderation. Use the [API console](try-image-api.md) or the [C# quickstart](image-moderation-quickstart-dotnet.md) to scan images and detect potential adult and racy content by using tags, confidence scores, and other extracted information.
- Implement text moderation. Use the [API console](try-text-api.md) or use the [C# quickstart](text-moderation-quickstart-dotnet.md) to scan text content for potential profanity, machine-assisted unwanted text classification (preview), and personally identifiable information (PII). 
- Implement video moderation. Use the [C# quickstart](video-moderation-api.md) to scan videos and detect potential adult and racy content.
