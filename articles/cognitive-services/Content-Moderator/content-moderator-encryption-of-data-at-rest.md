# Content Moderator encryption of data at rest

Content Moderator automatically encrypts your data when it is persisted to the cloud, helping to meet your organizational security and compliance goals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer-managed keys are only available on the E0 pricing tier. To request the ability to use customer-managed keys, fill out and submit the [Content Moderator Customer-Managed Key Request Form](https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk). Once approved for using CMK with the Content Moderator service, you will need to create a new Content Moderator resource and select E0 as the Pricing Tier. Once your Content Moderator resource with the E0 pricing tier is created, you can use Azure Key Vault to set up your managed identity.
