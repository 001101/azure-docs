# What is Content Moderator?

The Content Moderator service scans text, image, or video content for material that is potentially offensive, undesirable, or otherwise risky. Your app can then handle flagged content appropriately in order to comply with regulations or maintain an intended environment for users.

## Where it is used

The following are a few example scenarios where Content Moderator can be used:

- Online marketplaces moderating product catalogs and user-generated content
- Gaming companies moderating user-generated game artifacts and chat rooms
- Social messaging platforms moderating images, text, and videos added by their users
- Enterprise media companies implementing centralized content moderation for their content
- K-12 education solution providers filtering out content that is inappropriate or offensive for students and educators

## What it includes

The Content Moderator service consists of several web service APIs available through both REST calls and a .NET SDK. It also includes the human review tool, which allows human reviewers to aid the service and improve or fine-tune its moderation function.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Workflow API](try-review-api-workflow.md) is not yet available through the .NET SDK.
