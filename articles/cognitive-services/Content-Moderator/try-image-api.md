# Try Image Moderation API #

## About the Image Moderation API ##
Use the [Image Moderation API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/57cf753a3f9b070c105bd2c1/operations/57cf753a3f9b070868a1f66c) to initiate scan-and-review moderation workflows with text content. The moderation job scans your content for profanity, comparing it against custom and/or shared blacklists.

## Try with the API console ##
Before you can test-drive the API from the online console, you will need the **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**. This is found under the Settings tab, as shown below.
