# Moderate images and text on a Facebook page

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Content Moderator with a sample Facebook page to either take down or allow publishing of images and text by users browsing the Facebook page.

The tutorial will guide you through these steps:

1. Create a Content Moderator team.
2. Create Azure Functions that listen for HTTP events from Content Moderator and Facebook.
3. Create a Facebook Page and App, and connect it to Content Moderator

After we are done, Facebook will send the content posted by the visitors to Content Moderator. Based on the match thresholds, your Content Moderator workflows will either allow publishing the content or block and create reviews within the review tool for for human moderation.

## 1. Create a Content Moderator team

Refer to the [Quickstart](quick-start.md) page to sign up for Content Moderator and create a team.

## 2. Configure image thresholds (workflow)

Refer to the [Workflows](review-tool-user-guide/workflows) page to configure a custom image threshold and workflow. Note the workflow name.

## 3. Configure text thresholds (workflow)

Use steps similar to the [Workflows](review-tool-user-guide/workflows) page to configure a custom text threshold and workflow. Note the workflow name.
