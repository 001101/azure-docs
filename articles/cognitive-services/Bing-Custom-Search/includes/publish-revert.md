## Publish or revert
Changes you make to a Custom Search instance are made in the **Configuration** tab so you can validate your changes. When you're done making changes and ready to publish, click on **Push to Live State**. 

If you decide that you don't want to keep the changes you've made, click **Revert to Live State**. When you revert your changes, the live state configuration is unchanged and the Configuration tab is reverted to match the live state.
