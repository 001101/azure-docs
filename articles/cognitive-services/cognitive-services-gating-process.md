# Azure Cognitive Services - Gating Process

Cognitive Services extends artificial intelligence (AI) within reach to every developer, without requiring machine-learning expertise. All it takes is an API call to embed the ability to see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate decision-making into your applications. This article will guide you through the application process for gated Cognitive Services offerings.

Currently, the services below are offered through the gating process:

## Eligibility and Approval process

The gating process is in place to help gauge interest and better understand customer needs. The Microsoft team accepts applications from Microsoft commercial customers with a valid Azure subscription and a valid business scenario. Customers will potentially have their applications denied when:

 - They're not associated with any organization
 - They do not have a valid Azure subscription
 - The application was submitted through personal email (@hotmail.com, @gmail.com, @yahoo.com)
 - There was no proper justification or business scenario provided

Given the demand from different customer segments, we're attempting to expedite approval process. However, we cannot commit to a timeline. Once a decision is made, the Microsoft team will contact you and your account management team for the next steps. We appreciate your understanding and patience.

If the application is approved, the Microsoft team will send an email with all details, documentation, and guidance. Cognitive Services pricing details available [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/).
