# What is the Anomaly Detector API?

The Anomaly Detector API enables you to monitor and detect abnormalities in your time series data with machine learning. The Anomaly Detector API adapts by automatically identifying and applying the best fitting statistical models to your data, regardless of industry, scenario, or data volume. Using your time series data, the API determines whether a data point is an anomaly, its expected value, and the anomaly upper and lower bounds for visualization.

Using the Anomaly Detector doesn't require any prior experience in machine learning. The RESTful API enables you to easily integrate the service into your applications and processes, and it accepts any data set taken at uniform intervals of time. 

## Features

With the Anomaly Detector, you can automatically detect anomalies throughout your time series data, or as they occur in real-time. 

|Feature  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Detect anomalies as they occur in real-time. | Detect anomalies in your streaming data by using previously seen data points to determine if your latest one is an anomaly. This operation generates a model using the data points you send, and determines if the target point is an anomaly. By calling the API with each new data point you generate, you can monitor your data as it's created. |
|Detect anomalies throughout your data set as a batch. | Use your time series to detect any anomalies that might exist throughout your data. This operation generates a model using your entire time series data, with each point analyzed with the same model.         |
| Visualize the normal range of values for your data. | Visualize your data, including expected values, anomaly boundaries, and anomalies positions. |
| Adjust anomaly detection sensitivity to better fit your data. | Increase or decrease the sensitivity of the Anomaly Detector API's boundaries to better fit your data. |

## Demo

To quickly begin using the Anomaly Detector API, try an [online demo](https://notebooks.azure.com/AzureAnomalyDetection/projects/anomalydetector). This demo runs in a web-hosted Jupyter notebook and shows you how to send an API request, and visualize the result.

To run the demo, complete the following steps:
  
1.	Sign in, and click **Clone**, in the upper right corner.
3.	click **Run on free compute**
4.	Open one of the notebook, for example, Anomaly Detector API Example Private Preview (Batch Method).ipynb
5.	Fill in the key in cell containing:  subscription_key = '' #Here you have to paste your primary key. You can get the key by creating a [Cognitive Services account](../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md).
6.	In the Notebook main menu, click Cell->run all

## Workflow

The Anomaly Detector API is a RESTful web service, making it easy to call from any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON. Use [best practices](concepts/best-practices.md) when using the API for the best results for your data.

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-anomaly-detector-data-requirements](../../../includes/cognitive-services-anomaly-detector-data-requirements.md)]

1. Create a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with access to the Anomaly Detector API. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) for free.
2. Send a request to the API, with your data.
3. Process the API response by parsing the returned JSON message.
