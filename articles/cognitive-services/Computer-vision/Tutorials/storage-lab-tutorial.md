# Tutorial: use Computer Vision to generate image captions in Azure Storage

In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate the Azure Computer Vision service into a web app. The full app guide can be found in the [Azure Storage and Cognitive Services Lab](https://github.com/Microsoft/computerscience/blob/master/Labs/Azure%20Services/Azure%20Storage/Azure%20Storage%20and%20Cognitive%20Services%20(MVC).md) on GitHub, and this guide essentially covers Step 5 of the lab. You may wish to create an end-to-end application by following every step, but if you'd just like to see how Computer Vision can be integrated into an existing app, read along here.

This tutorial shows you how to:
