# Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Microsoft's Computer Vision API includes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities that extract printed or handwritten text from images and PDF documents. The OCR APIs extract text from both analog documents (images, scanned documents) and digitized documents. You can extract text from images in the wild, such as photos of license plates or containers with serial numbers, as well as from documents - invoices, bills, financial reports, articles, and more. 

## Read API 

Computer Vision’s [Read API](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005) is Microsoft’s latest OCR technology that extracts printed text in several languages, handwritten text (English only), digits, and currency symbols from images and multi-page PDF documents. It's optimized to extract text from in-the-wild text-heavy images and multi-page PDF documents with mixed languages. It supports detecting printed and handwritten text (English only) in the same image or document. Refer to the full list of [OCR supported languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/language-support#optical-character-recognition-ocr) page.

### How Read works

The Read API provides OCR capabilities via two operations - Read and Get Read Results.

### Input requirements

The [Read operation](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005) has an optional request parameter. This is the BCP-47 language code of the text in the document. Read supports auto language identification and multilingual documents, so only provide a language code if you would like to force the documented to be processed as that specific language.

The input images and documents have the following requirements:
* Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, PDF, and TIFF
* For PDF AND TIFF, up to 2000 pages are processed. For free tier subscribers, only the first two pages are processed.
* The file size must be less than 50 MB and dimensions at least 50 x 50 pixels and at most 10000 x 10000 pixels.
* The PDF dimensions must be at most 17 x 17 inches, corresponding to legal or A3 paper sizes and smaller.

### The Read operation
The [Read operation](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005) takes an image or PDF document as the input and executes asynchronously. The call returns with a response header field called 'Operation-Location'. The 'Operation-Location' value is a URL that contains the Operation Id to be used in the next step.

|Response header| Result URL |
|:-----|:----:|
|Operation-Location | https://cognitiveservice/vision/v3.0-preview/read/analyzeResults/49a36324-fc4b-4387-aa06-090cfbf0064f |

### The Get Read Results operation
The second step is to call the [Get Results](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d9869604be85dee480c8750) operation. This operation takes in the operation ID that was created by the Read operation. It then returns the extracted text content from your image or document in the form of JSON. The JSON response maintains the original line groupings of recognized words. It includes the extracted text lines and their bounding box coordinates. Each text line includes all extracted words with their coordinates and confidence scores.

### Sample JSON output

A successful response is returned in the JSON format as shown in the following example:

```json

  "status": "succeeded",
  "createdDateTime": "2020-05-28T05:13:21Z",

                  823,
                  144,

                ],
                "text": "The",
                "confidence": 0.958
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Follow the [Extract printed and handwritten text](./QuickStarts/CSharp-hand-text.md) quickstart to implement OCR using C# and the REST API.

### Supported languages

#### Printed text languages
The [Read 3.0 API](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005) supports extracting printed text in English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch languages. 

[Read 3.1 API public preview](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-1-preview-1/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005) adds support for Simplified Chinese. If your scenario requires supporting more languages, see the OCR API section in this document. 

Refer to the list of all [OCR supported languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/language-support#optical-character-recognition-ocr).

#### Handwritten text languages
Right now, the Read operation supports extracting handwritten text exclusively in English.

### Data privacy and security

As with all the cognitive services, developers using the Read service should be aware of Microsoft policies on customer data. See the Cognitive Services page on the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/product-overview) to learn more.

### Integration options

#### Use the Cloud API and SDK

The Cloud is the preferred approach for [getting started with the OCR API](./QuickStarts/CSharp-hand-text.md) for most customers because of ease of integration and fast productivity out of the box. Let Azure and the Computer Vision API take care of scale, performance, data security and compliance needs while you focus on meeting your customers' needs.

#### Use containers for on-premise deployment
Read is also available as a Docker container (preview) to enable you to deploy the new OCR capabilities in your own environment. Containers are great for specific security and data governance requirements. See [how to install and run Read containers.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/computer-vision-how-to-install-containers)


### OCR examples

#### Text from images

The following Read API output shows the extracted text lines and words from an image with text at different angles, colors, and fonts

![An image being rotated and its text being read and delineated](./Images/text-from-images-example.png)

#### Text from documents

In addition to images, the Read API takes a PDF document as input.

![An image being rotated and its text being read and delineated](./Images/text-from-documents-example.png)

#### Handwritten text in English

Right now, the Read operation supports extracting handwritten text exclusively in English.

#### Printed text in supported languages

![An image being rotated and its text being read and delineated](./Images/supported-languages-example.png)

#### Mixed languages support

The Read API supports images and documents with multiple languages in them, commonly known as mixed language documents. It does so by classifying each text line in the document into the detected language before extracting the text contents.

## OCR API

The [OCR API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) uses an older recognition model, supports only images, and executes synchronously, returning immediately with the detected text. See the [OCR supported languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/language-support#optical-character-recognition-ocr) than Read API.
