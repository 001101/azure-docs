# Sign up and billing

Although Cognitive Services has multiple APIs, we ask you to sign up for them individually so that you can manage costs and availability for each one.

+ [Pricing for text analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/text-analytics/)
+ [Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=cognitive-services)

Billing is based on transactions, where a transaction is based on the number of documents multiplied by unit of operation. There is no storage component to billing because we do not store your data. The following table illustrates the billing model at a glance.

| Document | Sentiment | Key Phrase | Language Detection | Transactions |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1  | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | 3 |
| 100 | ✔ | ✔ |   | 200 |
| 1000 |   |   | ✔ | 1000 |

Each tier provides an allocation of transactions to be consumed over a 30-day billing cycle. The counter is reset back to 0 on day 31. 

**What happens if transactions get used up before the current billing period ends?**

At the Free tier, excess requests are not handled and you get a message explaining why the request was dropped.

For billable tiers, an overage rate is applied for each transaction above the limit. The overage rate varies by tier, as indicated on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/text-analytics/). 

 > [!Note]
 > Text Analytics was [first announced](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2016/06/21/text-analytics-api-now-available-in-multiple-languages/) in June 2016 and is now [generally available (GA)](https://azure.microsoft.com//blog/) with support for production workloads. Preview pricing has been retired. For more information about service level agreements (SLA) from Microsoft, see [SLA for Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cognitive-services/v1_1/).

**How to sign up**

Sign in to the Azure portal, create a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account), choosing the **Text Analytics API**.

**How to restrict access to the API**

Selectively enable or disable access to specific APIs within your organization by [creating resource policies](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-policy-portal.md).

**How to change tiers**

Standard billing is offered at graduated levels of transactions. You can switch tiers and still keep the same endpoint and access keys.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and find your Text Analytics API dashboard.

2. Click **Price Tier**.

+ [Visit API reference documentation](//go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=759346) for technical documentation for the APIs. Documentation embeds interactive requests so that you can call the API from each documentation page.

+ To see how the Text Analytics API can be used as part of a bot, see the [Emotional Bot](http://docs.botframework.com/bot-intelligence/language/#example-emotional-bot) example on the Bot Framework site.
