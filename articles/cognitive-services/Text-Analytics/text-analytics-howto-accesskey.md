# How to find your access key for Text Analytics

When you sign up for Text Analytics, you get a personalized access key unique to your subscription. This key is required on each call to the Text Analytics API. If you haven't [signed up](text-analytics-howto-signup.md) yet,  do so now to get your key. 

If you aren't sure whether your subscription already has text analytics, or if you signed up but cannot find it in the port, use the following instructions to get your key. 

## Find your service and keys

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the left navigation pane, click **More services >** at the bottom of the list.

3. In Filter, type *Cognitive Services*. You should see your service in the list, where API Type is **Text Analytics API**.

4. Click the link to open the service blade. You can now get a key from **Resources > Keys** or by clicking **Show access keys** in the Essentials pane.
