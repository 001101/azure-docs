# Tutorial: Structure and consume a request for sentiment analysis using the Text Analytics API

Use this tutorial to implement an end-to-end sequence for acquiring source JSON documents, structuring a request for sentiment analysis using **Text Analytics API** in Microsoft Cognitive Services, and then hand off the response to Outlook or other app. 

We chose Logic Apps so that we could step through a large number of steps without the complexity of code. If you would rather start with code, see [How to develop a Text Analytics solution in C#]().

## Before you begin

TBD

## 1. 

no code -- integrated with Text Analytics API. 

consume APIs without writing code. 
separates design from code so that you can figure out the workflow you want, prior to writing code.


Advantage is that you can structure the request and response, visualized, in Logic Apps.

Create 4 things in Logic Apps Designer:
Connector for SA
Connector for KP
Compose Response (score, keyphrases)
Call the Response
Save



orchestration engine
create business process
with connectors

go to portal
create a logic app with name, resource group

choose a template - Blank Logic App
