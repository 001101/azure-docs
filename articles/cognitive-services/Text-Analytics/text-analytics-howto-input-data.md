# How to structure and manage data inputs to Text Analytics (Azure Cognitive Services)

TBD...

## Scoring large number of records

You can send several records in a single call, but keep in mind the following limits: Max request size: 1MB (for sentiment, KP and language) Max number of documents per request: 1000 Max size of a single document: 10KB +
If you need more than 1000 records analyzed, break up your content into several calls. You can make up to 100 API calls per minute -- effectively allowing you to score 100,000 records per minute.
