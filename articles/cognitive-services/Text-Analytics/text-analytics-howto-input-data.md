# How to structure and manage data inputs (Azure Cognitive Services > Text Analytics API)

TBD...

100 calls per minute


## Talking points

+ All 3 APIs are POST commands with mostly identical request structures
_ Consumes unstructured raw JSON text.
+ Required and optional parameters. If you know the language, specify it.
+ Order of operations (not sure this applies, but if you're using all 3, is there a recommended order in terms of performance or efficiency). Question: Does key phrase extraction inform sentiment analysis? If I want to understand the basis of a score, do the key phrases indicate what TA thought was important?
+ How to operate within limits (batch)
+ Generic recommendations: segment text into smaller units for improved sentiment analysis, enlarge text payload for improved language detection, batch documents to extract key phrases in a larger context (?)
+ Examples: Twitter, Facebook, Cosmos DB, Azure Data Lake, Azure SQL Database

## Scoring large number of records
You can send several records in a single call, but keep in mind the following limits:
Max request size: 1MB (for sentiment, KP and language)
Max number of documents per request: 1000
Max size of a single document: 10KB 

If you need more than 1000 records analyzed, break up your content into several calls. You can make up to 100 API calls per minute -- 
effectively allowing you to score 100,000 records per minute.
