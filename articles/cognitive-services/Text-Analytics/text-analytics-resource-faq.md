# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about Text Analytics API (Cognitive Services)
 
 Find answers to commonly asked questions about concepts, code, and scenarios related to the Text Analytics API for Microsoft Cognitive Services on Azure.

 ## Availability & billing

 ### Can I manually throttle requests to suspend billable transactions?

 You cannot pause the service or temporarily throttle requests service-side to conserve the balance of your request allocation for future use in the same billing cycle. The only guarantee for preventing transactions against your subscription is to remove the Text Analytics API from your subscription, and then repeat signup when you are ready to resume transactions. 
 
 Because data isn't stored, the impact on deleting and recreating the signup is generally minimal. The only coding investment you lose is the reference to your access key string, which you would need to update after signing up for the API.

## Architecture & concepts

 ### Can I find out if support for a specific language is forthcoming?

We avoid pre-announcing support for specific languages. This practice minimizes the chance of customers or partners taking a dependency on functionality that we might not be able to deliver in a timely manner. If you want support for a specific language, you can request or vote for it on [User Voice](https://cognitive.uservoice.com/). Your votes will help us prioritize which ones to work on next.

### Why do output calculations vary, when inputs are identical?

Improvements to models and algorithms are announced if the change is major, or quietly slipstreamed into the service if the update is minor. Over time, you might find that the same text input results in a different sentiment score or key phrase extraction. This is a normal and intended consequence of using managed machine learning resources in the cloud.

### Why do some sentiment scores seem off?

Machine learning algorithms for detecting sentiment are less effective if the sentiment is nuanced. Sarcasm, irony, puns, and some slang continues to challenge most analyzers. In general, sentiment scoring is best at predicting positive or negative sentiment. It attempts to provide a score whenever the model is given enough evidence to provide one. When the anaylzer is undecided, a neutral score of 0.5 is assigned to the document.
