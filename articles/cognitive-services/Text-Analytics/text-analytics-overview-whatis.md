# Welcome to Text Analytics API in Azure Cognitive Services

[Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/) is a collection of machine learning and AI technologies in the cloud, exposed through APIs so that you can leverage state of the art technology in your development projects. 

 Within Cognitive Services, **Text Analytics API** provides capabilities for sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and language detection.

## Capabilities in Text Analytics

Text analysis can mean different things, but in Azure Cognitive Services, APIs are exposed for the three types of analysis, as described in the following table. Each one is backed by natural language processing resources hosted in Azure, including ready-to-use pretrained models, always available to score any raw text that you upload to the service.

| Workloads | APIs | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
|Sentiment Analysis | [REST](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c9) or [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-TextAnalytics-DotNet) | Sentiment analysis helps you find out what customers think of your brand or topic by analyzing any text for clues about sentiment. This API returns a sentiment score between 0 and 1 for each document. The sentiment score is generated using classification techniques. |
|Key Phrase Extraction | [REST](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c6) or [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-TextAnalytics-DotNet) | Automatically extract key phrases to quickly identify the main points. For example, for the input text ‘The food was delicious and there were wonderful staff’, the service returns the main talking points: ‘food’ and ‘wonderful staff’. Key phrase extraction uses technology from Microsoft Office's sophisticated Natural Language Processing toolkit. |
|Language Detection | [REST](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c7) or [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-TextAnalytics-DotNet) |  For up to 120 languages, the service can detect which language the input text is written in and report a single language code for every document submitted on the request. The code is paired with a score indicating a level of certainty for the result. For example, if text includes a combination of languages, the service gives you the predominant language, but with a score reflecting the mixed results. |

> [!Note] 
> Machine learning algorithms in Cognitive services are trained and refined by Microsoft on a continuous development cycle. For this reason we do not divulge implementation details or internal architecture of specific technologies. For text analysis, you can control inputs and handle outputs, but there are no configuration options or settings to control how scoring or processing occurs.

 ## Typical workflow
 
1. [Sign up](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) for the **Text Analytics API** when creating a Cognitive Services account. As with most Azure Services, there is a free version so that you can experiment at no cost.

2. Post raw text data for analysis, in JSON, as part of a request for one of the following resources: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, or language detection.  

3. Store or stream the response returned from each request. Depending on the request, results are either a sentiment score, a collection of extracted keywords, or a language code.

Output is returned in the form of JSON documents in a one-to-one ratio: one JSON document output for every document input. You can subsequently analyze, visualize, or classify the results into actionable insights.

Data is not stored in your account. The functions performed by Text Analytics API are stateless, which means the text you provide is processed and results are returned immediately. 

With a few minor exceptions, the documents you provide can be used as-is for all three workloads. Given a single JSON documents collection, your code can invoke a series of operations (language detection, keyword extraction, sentiment analysis) over the same data.

## Supported languages

Text Analytics can detect language for up to 120 different languages. However, the supported language list for sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction is much smaller.

For both analyses, language support is initially rolled out in preview, graduating to generally available (GA) status on a per language basis, independently of each other and of the Text Analytics service overall. This means several languages are still in preview, even though the Text Analytics API itself is GA.

| Language    | Language code | Sentiment | Key phrases |
|:----------- |:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Danish      | `da` | ✔ \* |  |
| German       | `de` | ✔ \* | ✔ |
| Greek       | `el` | ✔ \* |  |
| English     | `en` | ✔ | ✔ | 
| Spanish     | `es` | ✔ | ✔ | 
| Finnish     | `fi` | ✔ \* |  | 
| French      | `fr` | ✔ | ✔ \* | 
| Japanese    | `ja` |  | ✔ |   |
| Italian     | `it` | ✔ \* |  | 
| Dutch       | `nl` | ✔ \* |  | 
| Norwegian   | `no` | ✔ \* |  | 
| Polish      | `pl` | ✔ \* |  | 
| Portuguese  | `pt` | ✔ |  | 
| Russian     | `ru` | ✔ \* |  | 
| Swedish     | `sv` | ✔ \* |  | 
| Turkish     | `tr` | ✔ \* |  |

## Data limits

Text Analytics accepts raw text data. The service currently sets a limit of 10 KB for each document. While this number might seem low, the vast majority of text submitted for analysis is below this limit. If you require a higher limit, [contact us](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/) so that we can discuss your requirements.

|Limits | |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Maximum size of a single document | 10 KB |
| Maximum size of entire request | 1 MB |
| Maximum number of documents in a request | 1,000 documents |

Rate limiting exists at a rate of 100 calls per minute. We therefore recommend that you submit large quantities of documents in a single call.

## Sign up and billing

Although Cognitive Services has multiple APIs, we ask you to sign up for them individually so that you can manage costs and availbility for each one.

+ [Pricing for text analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/text-analytics/)
+ [Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=cognitive-services)

Billing is per transaction, where a transaction is based on the number of documents multiplied by unit of operation. The following table illustrates the billing model at a glance.

| Document | Sentiment | Key Phrase | Language Detection | Transactions |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------------------|--------------|
|1  | x |  x | x  | 3 |
|100 | x |  x |   | 200 |
|1000 |   |   | x  |1000 |

You are charged only for the transactions you submit. There is no storage component to billing because we do not store your data, but there are [technical limits on the size and structure of the payload](#data-limits). Although you could load a document with the maximum amount of text to 

For all tiers, there is an upper limit on the number of requests within a 30 day period. The counter is reset back to 0 on day 31.

**What happens if you use up the transaction allocation before rolling over to the next period?**

At the Free tier, excess requests are not handled and you will get a message stating to that effect.

For billable tiers, the overage rate goes into effect for each transaction above the limit. The overage rate and the per-transaction rate vary by tier, with lower rates for larger request volumes. 

 > [!Note]
 > Text Analytics was [first announced](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2016/06/21/text-analytics-api-now-available-in-multiple-languages/) in June 2016 and is now [generally available (GA)](https://azure.microsoft.com//blog/) with support for production workloads. Preview pricing has been retired. For more information about service level agreements (SLA) from Microsoft, see [SLA for Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cognitive-services/v1_1/).

## Next steps

First, try the [interactive demo](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/). You can paste a text input (5K character maximum) to detect the language (up to 120), calculate a sentiment score, or extract key phrases.

Next, step through the [quickstart REST API tutorial](text-analytics-quickstart-rest-api.md) to learn the basic workflow using the REST API. You can use a Web API testing tool like Chrome Postman or Telerik Fiddler to minimize code investments while you evaluate the service.

For .NET developers, we recommend the [Cognitive Services Text Analytics .NET SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-TextAnalytics-DotNet) for developing text analysis apps in managed code.
