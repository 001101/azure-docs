+ Response outputs documents, one output document per input document, where each one has an ID plus one of the following: X, Y, Z
+ Nulls or empty rows, errors (irregular response)
+ Interpreting results
+ Approaches for fast visualization: Power BI (Power Query), Tableau
+ Custom code for rendering 
+ Other API necessary for trending (Twitter APIs with date/time info, Facebook, other)
