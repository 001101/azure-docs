# Collaborate on your knowledge base

QnA Maker allows multiple people to collaborate on a knowledge base. This feature is provided with the Azure [Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure). 

To share your QnAMaker service with someone:
1. Log in to the Azure portal, and go to your QnAMaker resource.

2. Go to the **Access Control (IAM)** tab.

3. Click on **Add**

4. Select the **Owner** or the **Contributor** role.

5. Enter the email you want to share with, and press save.

Now when the person you shared your QnAMaker service with, logs into the [QnAMaker portal](https://qnamaker.ai) they can see all the knowledge bases in that service.

Remember, you cannot share a particular knowledge base in a QnAMaker service. If you want more granular access control, consider distributing your knowledge bases across different QnAMaker services.
