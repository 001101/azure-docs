# Quickstart: Create a knowledge base then answer question via the QnA Maker portal

This portal-based tutorial walks you through programmatically creating and publishing a knowledge base, then answering a question from the knowledge base.

## Prerequisites

* You must have a [QnA Maker service](../How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md). 

> [!NOTE] 
> The programmatic version of this tutorial is available with a complete solution from the [**Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-csharp** Github repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-csharp/tree/master/documentation-samples/tutorials/create-publish-answer-knowledge-base).

## Create a knowledge base 

1. Sign in to the [QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai) portal. 

1. Select **Create a knowledge base** from the top menu.

    ![Step 1 of KB Creation process](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/create-kb-step-1.png)

1. Because you already have a QnA Maker Service, skip to step 2 in the portal. 

1. In the next step, select the existing settings:  

    |Setting|Purpose|
    |--|--|
    |Microsoft Azure Directory Id|The Microsoft Azure Directory Id is associated with the account you use to sign into the Azure portal and the QnA Maker portal. |
    |Azure Subscription name|The billing account you created the QnA Maker resource in.|
    |Azure QnA Service|The existing QnA Maker resource.|

    ![Step 2 of KB Creation process](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/create-kb-step-2.png)

1. In the next step, Enter your knowledge base name, `My Tutorial kb`.

    ![Step 3 of KB Creation process](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/create-kb-step-3.png)

1. In the next step, populate your kb with the following settings:  

    |Setting name|Setting value|Purpose|
    |--|--|--|
    |URL|`https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/faqs` |The contents of that FAQ at that URL are formatted in a question-then-answer style. QnA Maker can interpret this style to extract questions and the associated answers.|
    |File (not used in this tutorial)||This uploads files for questions and answers. See [Data sources supported](../Concepts/data-sources-supported.md) for more information. 
    |Chit-chat personality|The friend|This gives a friendly and casual [personality](../Concepts/best-practices.md#chit-chat) to common questions and answers. You can edit these questions and answers later. |

    ![Step 4 of KB Creation process](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/create-kb-step-4.png)

1. Select **Create your KB** to finish the creation process.

    ![Step 5 of KB Creation process](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/create-kb-step-5.png)

## Review KB, save, and train

1. Review the questions and answers. The first page is questions and answers from the URL. 

    ![Save and train](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/save-and-train-kb.png)

1. Select the last page of quesitons and answers from the bottom of the table. The page shows questions and answers from the Chit-chat personality. 

    ![View filters](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/save-and-train-kb-chit-chat.png)

1. From the toolbar above the list of questions and answers, select the gear. This shows the filters for each question and answer. The Chit-chat questions have the **editorial: chit-chat** filter already set. This filter is returned to the client application along with the selected answer. The client application, such as a chat bot, can use this filter to determine the type of answer returned and add to or change the answer based on the filter.

1. Select **Save and train** in the top menu bar.

## Publish to get KB endpoints

Select the **Publish** button from the top menu.

![Publish](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/publish-1.png)

After the KB is published, the endpoint is displayed

![Publish](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/publish-2.png)

## Use curl to query for an FAQ answer

1. Select the **Curl** tab. 

    ![Curl command](../media/qnamaker-tutorial-create-publish-query-in-portal/publish-3-curl.png)

1. Copy the text of the **Curl** tab and execute in a Curl-enabled terminal or command-line. Note that the authorization header's value includes the text `Endpoint ` with a trailing space then the key.

1. Replace `<Your question>` with `How large can my KB be?`.   

1. Execute the CURL command and receive the JSON response including the score and answer.

          ]
        }
      ]
    }
   
    ```

## Use curl to query for the default answer

Any question that QnA Maker is not confident in an answer receives the default answer. This answer is configured in the Azure portal. See [No match found](../Concepts/confidence-score.md#no-match-found) for more information. 

1. In the Curl-enabled terminal, replace `Thank you` with `x`. 

1. Execute the CURL command and receive the JSON response including the score and answer. 

    ```TXT
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100   186  100   170  100    16    272     25 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   297{
