#Customer intent: As an API or REST developer new to the QnA Maker service, I want to programmatically get an answer a knowledge base using C#.

## Get answers to a question by using a knowledge base

This quickstart walks you through programmatically getting an answer from a QnA Maker knowledge base. QnA Maker automatically extracts questions and answers from semi-structured content, like FAQs, from [data sources](../Concepts/data-sources-supported.md). The question is sent in the JSON sent in the body of the API request. 

```json
{question:'Does QnA Maker support non-English languages?'}
```

The answer is returned in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "questions": [
        "Does QnA Maker support non-English languages?"
      ],
      "answer": "See more details about [supported languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/overview/languages-supported).\n\n\nIf you have content from multiple languages, be sure to create a separate service for each language.",
      "score": 82.19,

      "metadata": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Prerequisites

* Latest [**Visual Studio Community edition**](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
* You must have a [QnA Maker service](../How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md). To retrieve your key, select **Keys** under **Resource Management** in your dashboard. 
* Published knowledge base's ID. You can create an empty knowledge base, then import this KB on the **Settings** page, then publish. You can download and use [this basic KB](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/qna-maker/knowledge-bases/basic-kb.tsv).

The code for this quickstart is available. 


## Create a knowledge base project

[!INCLUDE [Create Visual Studio Project](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-qnamaker-quickstart-csharp-create-project.md)] 

## Add the required dependencies

At the top of Program.cs, replace the single using statement with the following lines to add necessary dependencies to the project:

[!code-csharp[Add the required dependencies](~/samples-qnamaker-csharp/documentation-samples/quickstarts/get-answer-from-knowledge-base/QnAMakerAnswerQuestion/Program.cs?range=1-4 "Add the required dependencies")]

## Add the required constants

At the top of the Program class, add the following constants to access QnA Maker:

[!code-csharp[Add the required constants](~/samples-qnamaker-csharp/documentation-samples/quickstarts/create-knowledge-base/QnaQuickstartCreateKnowledgebase/Program.cs?range=17-24 "Add the required constants")]

## Add the KB definition

After the constants, add the following KB definition:

[!code-csharp[Add the required constants](~/samples-qnamaker-csharp/documentation-samples/quickstarts/create-knowledge-base/QnaQuickstartCreateKnowledgebase/Program.cs?range=32-57 "Add the required constants")]

## Add supporting functions and structures
Add the following code block inside the Program class:

[!code-csharp[Add supporting functions and structures](~/samples-qnamaker-csharp/documentation-samples/quickstarts/create-knowledge-base/QnaQuickstartCreateKnowledgebase/Program.cs?range=62-82 "Add supporting functions and structures")]

## Add a POST request to create KB

The following code makes an HTTPS request to the QnA Maker API to create a KB and receives the response:

[!code-csharp[Add a POST request to create KB](~/samples-qnamaker-csharp/documentation-samples/quickstarts/create-knowledge-base/QnaQuickstartCreateKnowledgebase/Program.cs?range=91-105 "Add a POST request to create KB")]

This API call returns a JSON response that includes the operation ID in the header field **Location**. Use the operation ID to determine if the KB is successfully created. 

```JSON
{
  "operationState": "NotStarted",
  "createdTimestamp": "2018-09-26T05:19:01Z",
  "lastActionTimestamp": "2018-09-26T05:19:01Z",
  "userId": "XXX9549466094e1cb4fd063b646e1ad6",
  "operationId": "8dfb6a82-ae58-4bcb-95b7-d1239ae25681"
}
```

## Add GET request to determine creation status

Check the status of the operation.

[!code-csharp[Add GET request to determine creation status](~/samples-qnamaker-csharp/documentation-samples/quickstarts/create-knowledge-base/QnaQuickstartCreateKnowledgebase/Program.cs?range=159-170 "Add GET request to determine creation status")]

This API call returns a JSON response that includes the operation status: 

```JSON
{
  "operationState": "NotStarted",
  "createdTimestamp": "2018-09-26T05:22:53Z",
  "lastActionTimestamp": "2018-09-26T05:22:53Z",
  "userId": "XXX9549466094e1cb4fd063b646e1ad6",
  "operationId": "177e12ff-5d04-4b73-b594-8575f9787963"
}
```

Repeat the call until success or failure: 

```JSON
{
  "operationState": "Succeeded",
  "createdTimestamp": "2018-09-26T05:22:53Z",
  "lastActionTimestamp": "2018-09-26T05:23:08Z",
  "resourceLocation": "/knowledgebases/XXX7892b-10cf-47e2-a3ae-e40683adb714",
  "userId": "XXX9549466094e1cb4fd063b646e1ad6",
  "operationId": "177e12ff-5d04-4b73-b594-8575f9787963"
}
```

## Add CreateKB method

The following method creates the KB and repeats checks on the status.  The _create_ **Operation ID** is returned in the POST response header field **Location**, then used as part of the route in the GET request. Because the KB creation may take some time, you need to repeat calls to check the status until the status is either successful or fails. When the operation succeeds, the KB ID is returned in **resourceLocation**. 

[!code-csharp[Add CreateKB method](~/samples-qnamaker-csharp/documentation-samples/quickstarts/create-knowledge-base/QnaQuickstartCreateKnowledgebase/Program.cs?range=176-237 "Add CreateKB method")]

## Add the CreateKB method to Main

Change the Main method to call the CreateKB method:

[!code-csharp[Add CreateKB method](~/samples-qnamaker-csharp/documentation-samples/quickstarts/create-knowledge-base/QnaQuickstartCreateKnowledgebase/Program.cs?range=239-248 "Add CreateKB method")]

## Build and run the program

Build and run the program. It will automatically send the request to the QnA Maker API to create the KB, then it will poll for the results every 30 seconds. Each response is printed to the console window.

Once your knowledge base is created, you can view it in your QnA Maker Portal, [My knowledge bases](https://www.qnamaker.ai/Home/MyServices) page.

The following code gets answers to a question using the specified knowledge base, using the **Generate answers** method.

1. Create a new C# project in your favorite IDE.
1. Add the code provided below.
1. Replace the `host` value with the Website name for your QnA Maker subscription. For more information see [Create a QnA Maker service](../How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md).
1. Replace the `endpoint_key` value with a valid endpoint key for your subscription. Note this is not the same as your subscription key. You can get your endpoint keys using the [Get endpoint keys](#GetKeys) method.
1. Replace the `kb` value with the ID of the knowledge base you want to query for answers. Note this knowledge base must already have been published using the [Publish](#Publish) method.
1. Run the program.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace QnAMaker
{
    class Program
    {
        // NOTE: Replace this with a valid host name.
        static string host = "ENTER HOST HERE";

        // NOTE: Replace this with a valid endpoint key.
        // This is not your subscription key.
        // To get your endpoint keys, call the GET /endpointkeys method.
        static string endpoint_key = "ENTER KEY HERE";

        // NOTE: Replace this with a valid knowledge base ID.
        // Make sure you have published the knowledge base with the
        // POST /knowledgebases/{knowledge base ID} method.
        static string kb = "ENTER KB ID HERE";

        static string service = "/qnamaker";
        static string method = "/knowledgebases/" + kb + "/generateAnswer/";

        static string question = @"
{
    'question': 'Is the QnA Maker Service free?',
    'top': 3
}
";

        async static Task<string> Post(string uri, string body)
        {
            using (var client = new HttpClient())
            using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage())
            {
                request.Method = HttpMethod.Post;
                request.RequestUri = new Uri(uri);
                request.Content = new StringContent(body, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
                request.Headers.Add("Authorization", "EndpointKey " + endpoint_key);

                var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
                return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            }
        }

        async static void GetAnswers()
        {
            var uri = host + service + method;
            Console.WriteLine("Calling " + uri + ".");
            var response = await Post(uri, question);
            Console.WriteLine(response);
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue.");
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            GetAnswers();
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

**Get answers response**

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "questions": [
        "Can I use BitLocker with the Volume Shadow Copy Service?"
      ],
      "answer": "Yes. However, shadow copies made prior to enabling BitLocker will be automatically deleted when BitLocker is enabled on software-encrypted drives. If you are using a hardware encrypted drive, the shadow copies are retained.",
