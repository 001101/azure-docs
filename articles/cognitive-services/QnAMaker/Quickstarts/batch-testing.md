# Quickstart: Test knowledge base with batch questions and expected answers

Use the QnA Maker batch testing tool to test your knowledge base for expected answers, confidence scores, and multi-turn prompts.

## Prerequisites

* Download the [multi-turn sample `.docx` file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/qna-maker/data-source-formats/multi-turn.docx)
* Download the [batch testing tool](https://aka.ms/qnamakerbatchtestingtool), extract the file from the `.zip` file.
* Either [create a QnA Maker service](create-publish-knowledge-base.md#create-a-new-qna-maker-knowledge-base) or use an existing service.

## Create a new knowledge base from the multi-turn .docx file

1. [Sign in](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) to the QnA Maker portal.
1. Select **Create a knowledge base** from the tool bar.
1. Skip **Step 1**, moving on to **Step 2** to select your existing service.
1. Enter the name `Multi-turn batch test quickstart` as the name of your knowledge base.
1. In **Step 4**, check **Enable multi-turn extraction from URLs, .pdf or .docx files**.
1. Enter the **Default answer text** of `Quickstart - can't find answer`.
1. Still in **Step 4**, select **+ Add file** then select the downloaded `.docx` file listing in the prerequisites.
1. In **Step 5**, select **Create your KB**.

    When the creation process finishes, the portal displays the editable knowledge base.

## Save, train, and publish knowledge base

1. Select **Save and train** from the toolbar to save the knowledge base.
1. Select **Publish** from the toolbar then select **Publish** again to publish the knowledge so that you can query the knowledge base from a public URL endpoint. Once the publish is completed, save the host URL and endpoint key information shown on the publish page.

    |Required data| Example|
    |--|--|
    |Published Host|`https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.azurewebsites.net`|
    |Published Key|`XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` (32 character string shown after `Endpoint` )|
    |App ID|`e906af8d-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-2c0ea7b1376e` (36 character string shown as part of `POST`) |

## Create batch test file with question IDs

In order to use the batch test tool, create a file named `batch-test-data-1.tsv` with a text editor. The file needs to have the following columns

|TSV input file fields|Notes|Example|
|--|--|--|
|KBID|Your KB ID found on the Publish page.|`e906af8d-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-2c0ea7b1376e` (36 character string shown as part of `POST`) |
|Question|The question text a user would enter.|`How do I sign out?`|
|Metadata tags|optional|`topic:power`|
|Top parameter|optional|`25`|
|Expected answer ID|optional|`13`|

For the multi-turn knowledge base, add 3 rows to the file. The first column is your knowledge base ID and the second column should be the following list of questions:

|Column 2 - questions|
|--|
|`Use Windows Hello to sign in`|
|`Charge your Surface Pro 4`|
|`Get to know Windows 10`|

These questions are the exact wording from the knowledge base and should return 100 as the confidence score. Next, add a few questions, similar to these questions but not exactly the same:

|Column 2 - questions|
|--|
|`What is Windows Hello?`|
|`How do I charge the laptop?`|
|`What features are in Windows 10?`|

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure that each column is separated by a tab delimiter only. Leading or trailing spaces are added to column data and will cause the program to throw exceptions when the type or size is incorrect.

The batch test file, when opened in Excel, looks like the following image.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Input first version of .tsv file from batch test](../media/batch-test/batch-test-1-input.png)

## Run the test against the batch file

Run the batch testing using the following format at the command line with your published host and key, found on the **Settings** page.

The published host includes your resource name. The published key **is not** the same as your QnA Maker resource key.

```console
batchtesting.exe batch-test-data-1 https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.azurewebsites.net ENDPOINT-KEY out.tsv
```

The test completes and generates the `out.tsv` file:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Output first version of .tsv file from batch test](../media/batch-test/batch-test-1-output.png)


## Using optional fields in the input batch test file

Use the following chart to understand how to find the field values for optional data.

|Column number|Optional column|Data location|
|--|--|--|
|3|metadata|Export existing knowledge base for values.|
|4|top|Default value of `25` is recommended.|
|5|Question and answer set ID|Export existing knowledge base for values.|

## Add metadata to the knowledge base

1. In the QnA portal, on the **Edit** page, add metadata of `topic:power` to the following questions:

    |Questions|
    |--|
    |Charge your Surface Pro 4|
    |Check the battery level|

1. Select **Save and train**, then select the **Publish** page, then select the **Publish** button.
1. Select the **Settings** page, then select **Export** as a `.xls` file.
1. Find this downloaded file and open with Excel.

    The downloaded file has the correct format for the metadata and the correct question and answer set ID.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Exported knowledge base with metadata](../media/batch-test/exported-knowledge-base-with-metadata.png)

1. Edit the `batch-test-data-1.tsv` file to add the metadata, top, and qna set ID.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Input second version of .tsv file from batch test](../media/batch-test/batch-test-2-input.png)

1. Rerun the batch test with the same command. The output now includes matches.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Output second version of .tsv file from batch test](../media/batch-test/batch-test-2-output.png)
