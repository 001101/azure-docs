## Get answers to a question from a knowledge base with Java

This quickstart walks you through programmatically getting an answer from a published QnA Maker knowledge base. QnA Maker automatically extracts questions and answers from semi-structured content, like FAQs, from [data sources](../Concepts/data-sources-supported.md). The question, in JSON format, is sent in the body of the API request. 

An example JSON-formatted question for the REST API:

```json
{question:'Does QnA Maker support non-English languages?'}
```

The answer is returned in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "questions": [
        "Does QnA Maker support non-English languages?"
      ],
      "answer": "See more details about [supported languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/overview/languages-supported).\n\n\nIf you have content from multiple languages, be sure to create a separate service for each language.",
      "score": 82.19,
      "id": 11,

      "metadata": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Prerequisites

* [JDK SE](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks)  (Java Development Kit, Standard Edition)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* You must have a [QnA Maker service](../How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md). To retrieve your key, select **Keys** under **Resource Management** in your Azure dashboard for your QnA Maker resource. 
* Published knowledge base's ID. You can create an empty knowledge base, then import a KB on the **Settings** page, then publish. You can download and use [this basic KB](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/qna-maker/knowledge-bases/basic-kb.tsv).

The code for this quickstart is in the [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-qnamaker-java/tree/master/documentation-samples/quickstarts/get-answer) repository. 

## Create a java file

Open VSCode and create a new file named `GetAnswer.java` and add the following class:

```Java
public class GetAnswer {

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {

    }
}
```

## Add the required dependencies

This quickstart uses Apache classes for HTTP requests. Above the GetAnswer class, at the top of the `GetAnswer.java` file, add necessary dependencies to the project:

[!code-java[Add the required dependencies](~/samples-qnamaker-java/documentation-samples/quickstarts/get-answer/GetAnswer.java?range=5-13 "Add the required dependencies")]

## Add the required constants

At the top of the `GetAnswer.java` class, add the following constants to access QnA Maker:

[!code-java[Add the required constants](~/samples-qnamaker-java/documentation-samples/quickstarts/get-answer/QnAMakerAnswerQuestion/Program.java?range=26-42 "Add the required constants")]

## Add a POST request to send question

The following code makes an HTTPS request to the QnA Maker API to send the question to the KB and receives the response:

[!code-java[Add a POST request to send question to KB](~/samples-qnamaker-java/documentation-samples/quickstarts/get-answer/QnAMakerAnswerQuestion/Program.java?range=37-64 "Add a POST request to send question to KB")]

## Add GetAnswers method 

[!code-java[Get Answers](~/samples-qnamaker-java/documentation-samples/quickstarts/get-answer/QnAMakerAnswerQuestion/Program.java?range=49-56 "Get Answers")]

## Add the GetAnswers method to Main

Change the Main method to call the GetAnswers method:

[!code-java[Add CreateKB method](~/samples-qnamaker-java/documentation-samples/quickstarts/get-answer/QnAMakerAnswerQuestion/Program.java?range=58-62 "Add CreateKB method")]

## Build and run the program

Build and run the program from the command line. It will automatically send the request to the QnA Maker API, then it will print to the console window.

1. Build the file:

    ```Java
    javac -cp "lib/*" GetAnswer.java
    ```

1. Run the file:

    ```Java
    java -cp ".;lib/*" GetAnswer
    ```
