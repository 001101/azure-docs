# Translator Speech API Documentation

[!INCLUDE [Deprecation note](../../../includes/cognitive-services-translator-speech-deprecation-note.md)]

Microsoft Translator Speech API, part of the Microsoft Cognitive Services API collection, is a cloud-based machine translation service that provides speech to speech or speech to text translation. Based on the industry standard REST technology, it can be used to add end-to-end, real-time, speech translations to any application, tool, or solution requiring multi-language speech translation regardless of the target OS or development languages. For the list of supported languages, see the [Supported languages](languages.md) article.
