# Send and receive messages with the Azure Service Bus connector

To send and receive messages with your logic app, 
connect to [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/). 
You can perform actions such as send to a queue, send to a topic, 
receive from a queue, and receive from a subscription. 
Learn more about [Azure Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md) 
and [how pricing works for Logic Apps triggers](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md).

## Requirements

To useÂ [any connector](../connectors/apis-list.md) 
in your logic app, you have to first create a logic app. Learn 
[how to create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Connect to Service Bus

Before your logic app can access any service, 
you have to create a [*connection*](./connectors-overview.md) 
between your logic app and the service, if you haven't already. 
This connection authorizes your logic app to access data. 

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to Azure Service Bus](../../includes/connectors-create-api-servicebus.md)]

## Trigger your workflow when your Service Bus gets new messages

A [*trigger*](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts) 
is an event that starts a workflow in your logic app.

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a Service Bus trigger](../../includes/connectors-create-api-servicebus-trigger.md)]

## Process messages from a Service Bus

An [*action*](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts) 
is a task performed by your logic app workflow. After you add a trigger to your logic app, 
you can add an action to perform operations with data generated by that trigger. 
To perform some work on the messages that you get from your Service bus, follow these steps.

[!INCLUDE [Steps to create a Service Bus action](../../includes/connectors-create-api-servicebus-action.md)]

## Connector-specific details
