# Integrate 3270 screen-driven apps on IBM mainframes with Azure by using Azure Logic Apps and HIS 3270 connector

> [!NOTE]
> This connector is in *public preview*.

With Azure Logic Apps and the HIS 3270 connector, you can 
access and run IBM mainframe apps that you usually drive by 
navigating through 3270 emulator screens. That way, you can 
integrate your IBM mainframe apps with Azure, Microsoft, 
and other apps, services, and systems by creating automated 
workflows with Azure Logic Apps. The connector communicates 
with IBM mainframes by using the TN3270 protocol and is 
available in all Azure Logic Apps regions except for Azure 
Government and Azure China 21Vianet. If you're new to logic apps, review 
[What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

This article describes these aspects for using the 3270 connector: 

* Why use the HIS 3270 connector in Azure Logic Apps 
and how the connector runs 3270 screen-driven apps

* The prerequisites and setup for using the 3270 connector

* The steps for adding 3270 connector actions to your logic app

## Why use this connector?

To access apps on IBM mainframes, you typically use a 
3270 terminal emulator, often called a "green screen". 
This method is a time-hardened way but has many limitations. 
Although Host Integration Server (HIS) lets you work directly 
with these apps, sometimes, separating the screen and business 
logic isn't possible. Or maybe you no longer have information 
about how the host applications work.

For these scenarios, you can create .NET apps that programmatically 
drive the 3270 screens without making changes to the host. To create 
these apps, you can use the Session Integrator feature, which is a .NET 
library for writing custom apps that can access 3270 screen-driven data, 
also known as "screen scraping".

To extend these scenarios, the HIS 3270 connector in Azure Logic Apps 
works with the standalone HIS 3270 Design Tool, which you use to record, 
or "capture", the host screens used for a specific task, define the 
navigation flow through your mainframe app for that task, and define 
the methods with input and output parameters for that task. The design 
tool converts that information into metadata that the 3270 connector uses 
when calling an action that represents that task from your logic app. 

After you generate the metadata file from the design tool, you add the file 
to an integration account in Azure. That way, your logic app can access the 
metadata about your app when you add a 3270 connector action. The connector 
reads the metadata file from your integration account and dynamically presents 
the parameters for the 3270 action.

So, by handling navigation through the 3270 screens, entering data into the 
host application, and returning the results to your logic app, you can 
integrate your legacy apps with Azure, Microsoft, and other apps, services, 
and systems that Azure Logic Apps supports.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Azure account</a>.

* Basic knowledge about 
[how to create logic apps](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md)

* Recommended: An [integration service environment (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment.md), 
which you can use as the location for creating and running 
your logic app. An ISE provides access from your logic app to 
resources that are protected inside Azure virtual networks.

* The logic app to use for automating and running 
your 3270 screen-driven app. The HIS 3270 connector 
doesn't have triggers, so use another trigger to start 
your logic app, such as the **Recurrence** trigger. 
You can then add 3270 connector actions. To get started, 
[create a blank logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md). 
If you use an ISE, select that ISE as your logic app's location.

* Download and install the [standalone HIS 3270 Design Tool](https://aka.ms/3270-design-tool-download), 
which you use for generating a Host Integration Designer 
XML (HIDX) file. This metadata file identifies the screens, 
navigation path, method, and parameters for the task you 
want to use when you add and run a 3270 connector action.

  The Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 is the 
  only prerequisite for the 3270 Design Tool. 
  After you download and install this tool, 
  follow these setup steps:

  1. Open the HIS 3270 Design Tool. 
  From the **Session** menu, select **Host Sessions**.
  
  1. Provide your TN3270 host server information.

* An [integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) 
where you store your HIDX file as a map so your logic app 
can access the metadata and method definitions in that file. 
Make sure your integration account is linked to the logic app 
you're using. Also, if you use an ISE, make sure your integration 
account's location is the same ISE that your logic app uses.

* Access to the TN3270 Server that hosts your mainframe app

## Create metadata overview

In a 3270 screen-driven app, the screens and data fields are unique 
to your scenarios, so the 3270 connector needs this information about 
your app, which you can provide as metadata. This metadata describes 
information that helps your logic app identify and recognize screens, 
describes how to navigate between screens, where to input data, 
and where to expect results. To specify and generate this metadata, 
you use the standalone 3270 Design Tool, which walks you through 
these specific *modes*, or stages, as described later in more details:

* **Capture**: In this mode, you record the screens required for completing 
a specific task with your mainframe app, for example, getting a bank balance.

* **Navigation**: In this mode, you specify the plan or path for how 
to navigate through your mainframe app's screens for the specific task.

* **Methods**: In this mode, you define the method, for example, `GetBalance`, 
that describes the screen navigation path. You also choose the fields on each 
screen that become the method's input and output parameters.

### Unsupported elements

The design tool doesn't support these elements:

* Partial IBM Basic Mapping Support (BMS) maps: If you import a BMS map, 
the design tool ignores partial screen definitions.
* In/Out parameters: You can't define In/Out parameters.
* Menu processing: Not supported during preview
* Array processing: Not supported during preview

<a name="capture-screens"></a>

## Capture screens

In this mode, you mark an item on each 3270 screen that uniquely identifies that screen. 
For example, you might specify a line of text or a more complex set of conditions, 
such as specific text and a non-empty field. You can either record these screens 
over a live connection to the host server, or import this information from an IBM 
Basic Mapping Support (BMS) map. The live connection uses a TN3270 emulator for 
connecting to the host. Each connector action must map to a single task that starts 
with connecting to your session and ends with disconnecting from your session.

1. In the 3270 Design Tool, from the **Recording** menu, 
select **Start Recording**. Or, you can just press the F5 key.

1. From the **Session** menu, select **Connect**.

1. Starting from the first screen in your app, step through 
your app for the specific task that you're recording.

1. After you finish the task, sign out from your session as you usually do.

1. From the **Session** menu, select **Disconnect**.

1. From the **Recording** menu, select **Stop Recording**. 
Or, you can just press the Shift + F5 keys.

   After you capture the screens for a task, the designer tool 
   shows thumbnails that represent those screens. Along with your 
   captured screens, you also have a screen that's named "Empty". 
   When you first connect to the Customer Information Control 
   System (CICS), you must choose **Clear** before you can enter 
   the name for the transaction you want to run. This "clear" screen 
   doesn't have any attributes to recognize. So, by default, this 
   screen is named "Empty". You can use the screen later for 
   representing the screen where you enter the transaction name.

1. Now specify the fields for identifying each screen.

   With the 3270 data stream, screens don't have default identifiers, 
   so you need to select unique text on each screen. For complex scenarios, 
   you can specify multiple conditions, for example, unique text and a 
   field with a specific value.

After you finish selecting the identification fields, 
move to the next mode.

### Conditions for identifying repeated screens

For the connector to navigate and differentiate between screens, 
you usually find unique text on a screen that you can use as an 
identifier among the captured screens. For repeated screens, 
you might need more identification methods. For example, suppose 
you have two screens that look the same except one screen returns 
a valid value, while the other screen returns an error message.

In the design tool, you can add *recognition attributes*, 
for example, a screen title such as "Get Account Balance", 
by using the Screen Recognition editor. If you have a forked 
path and both branches return the same screen but with 
different results, you need other identification attributes. 
At run time, the connector uses these attributes for 
determining the current branch and fork. Here are the 
conditions you can use:

* Specific value: This value matches the specified string 
at the specified location.
* NOT a specific value: This value doesn't match the 
specified string at the specified location.
* NOT empty: This field isn't empty.
* Empty: This field is empty.

To learn more, see the [Example navigation plan](#example-plan) 
later in this topic.

<a name="define-navigation"></a>

## Define navigation plans

In this mode, you define the flow or steps for navigating 
through your mainframe app's screens for your specific task. 
For example, sometimes, you might have more than one path that 
your app can take where one path produces the correct result, 
while the other path produces an error. For each screen, specify the 
keystrokes necessary for moving to the next screen, such as `CICSPROD <enter>`.

> [!TIP]
> If you're automating several tasks that use the same connect and 
> disconnect screens, the design tool provides special Connect and 
> Disconnect plan types. After you define these types, you can add 
> them to the start and end for your navigation plan.

### Guidelines for plan definitions

* Include all screens, starting from connecting 
and ending with disconnecting.

* You can create a standalone plan or use the 
Connect and Disconnect plans, which let you reuse 
a series of screens common to all your transactions.

  * The last screen in your Connect plan must be the 
  same screen as the first screen in your navigation plan.

  * The first screen in your Disconnect plan must be 
  same screen as the last screen in your navigation plan.

* Your captured screens might contain many repeated screens, 
so select and use only one instance of any repeated screens 
in your plan. Here are some examples of repeated screens:

  * The sign in screen, for example, the **MSG-10** screen
  * The welcome screen for the Customer Information Control System (CICS)
  * The "Clear" or **Empty** screen

<a name="create-plans"></a>

### Create plans

1. In the design tool, to start your plan, choose **New Plan**.

1. Drag those thumbnails to the navigation plan surface.

   To represent the blank screen where you enter 
   the transaction name, use the "Empty" screen.

1. Arrange the screens in the order that describes the task you're defining.

1. After arranging the screens, draw arrows between the screens by using the Flow tool. 
The arrows define the flow, including forks and joins, through the screens.

1. For each screen, specify the Automatic Initiate Descriptor (AID) 
key and the static text that moves the flow to the next screen.
You might have just the AID key, or both the AID key and text. 

After you finish your navigation plan, 
you can [define methods in the next mode](#define-method).

<a name="example-plan"></a>

### Example

In this example, suppose you run a CICS 
transaction named "WBGB" that has these steps: 

* On the first screen, you enter a name and an account.
* On the second screen, you get the account balance.
* You exit to the "Empty" screen.
* You sign out from CICS to the "MSG-10" screen.

Also suppose that you repeat these steps, but you enter incorrect 
data so you can capture the screen that shows the error. Here are 
the screens you capture:

* MSG-10
* CICS Welcome
* Empty
* WBGB_1 (input)
* WBGB_2 (error)
* Empty_1
* MSG-10_1

Although many screens here get unique names, some screens are the same screen, 
for example, "MSG-10" and "Empty". For a repeated screen, use only one instance 
for that screen in your plan. Here are examples that show how a standalone plan, 
Connect plan, Disconnect plan, and a combined plan might look:

* Standalone plan

  ![Standalone navigation plan](./media/connectors-create-api-3270/standalone-plan.png)

* Connect plan

  ![Connect plan](./media/connectors-create-api-3270/connect-plan.png)

* Disconnect plan

  ![Disconnect plan](./media/connectors-create-api-3270/disconnect-plan.png)

* Combined plan

  ![Combined plan](./media/connectors-create-api-3270/combined-plan.png)

#### Example - identify repeated screens

For the connector to navigate and differentiate between screens, 
you usually find unique text on a screen that you can use as an 
identifier among the captured screens. For repeated screens, 
you might need more identification methods. The example plan has a 
fork where you can get screens that look similar. One screen returns 
an account balance, while the other screen returns an error message.

In the design tool, you can add *recognition attributes*, 
such as the screen title, "Get Account Balance", by using 
the Screen Recognition editor. In the case with similar screens, 
you need other attributes. At run time, the connector uses 
these attributes for determining the branch and fork.

* In the branch that returns valid input, which is 
the screen with the account balance, you can add an 
attribute with a "not empty" condition.

* In the branch that returns with an error, you can 
add an attribute with an "empty" condition.

<a name="define-method"></a>

## Define methods

In this mode, you define a method that's associated with your navigation plan. 
For each method parameter, you specify the data type, such as a string, integer, 
date or time, and so on. When you're done, you can test your method on the 
live host and confirm that the method works as expected. You then generate 
the metadata file, or Host Integration Designer XML (HIDX) file, which now 
has the method definitions to use for creating and running an action for 
the HIS 3270 connector.

1. In the design tool, to start your method, choose **New**.

1. On the navigation plan surface, select the screen that 
has the input fields you want.

1. To add the first input parameter for your method, 
in the 3270 emulator screen, choose the field you 
want as the first input, and then choose **Input**. 

   To add more parameters, repeat this step for each parameter.

1. To add the first output parameter for your method, 
in the 3270 emulator screen, choose the field you want 
as the first output, and then choose **Output**.

1. After you add all your parameters for your method, 
define the data type for each parameter.

The design tool saves all this information to a file that has a 
RAP (.rap) extension. You can save to this file during any mode. 
Before you can test your method, save to this file after defining 
your method. To view a sample RAP file, from the design tool, 
browse to this folder in the design tool's installation location:

`..\Program Files\Microsoft Host Integration Server - 3270 Design Tool\SDK\WoodgroveBank.rap`

### Test your method

1. In the design tool, choose **Play** or press the F5 key, 
which runs your method definition against the live host.

1. Enter values for your parameters, and choose **OK**.

1. To continue to the next screen, choose **Next**.

1. When you're finished, choose **Done**, which 
displays the value for your output parameter.

## Add metadata file to integration account

When you're done, [add your HIDX file as a map to your integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-maps.md) 
by using the Azure portal. In a later section on this page, 
you learn how to add an HIS 3270 action to your logic app. 
When you add this action for the first time, you're prompted 
to create a connection from your logic app to the host server, 
and provide connection information, such as the names for your 
integration account and host server. After you create the connection, 
you can select your previously added HIDX file, the method to run, 
and the parameters to use.

After you finish all these steps, the action you created is 
ready for connecting to your IBM mainframe, drive screens 
for your app, enter data, return results, and so on. 
You can also continue adding other actions to your logic 
app for integrating with other apps, services, and systems.
