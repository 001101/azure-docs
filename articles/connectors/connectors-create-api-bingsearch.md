# Get started with the Bing Search connector
Connect to Bing Search to search news, search videos, and more. With Bing Search, you can: 

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from your search. 
* Use actions to search images, search the news, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, you can search for a video, and then use Twitter to post that video to a Twitter feed.

You can get started by creating a logic app now, see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).
