# Data security and privacy policies for Google connectors in Azure Logic Apps

Starting May 1, 2020, changes by Google to their [data security and privacy policies](https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/) might affect your logic app workflows that use the [Gmail connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/gmail/). If you use a Gmail consumer account (email address that ends with @gmail.com or @googlemail.com) with the Gmail connector, your logic apps can use only a limited set of [Google-approved triggers, actions, and connectors](#approved-connectors).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a G-Suite business account (email address with a custom domain), 
> your workflows are not affected, and you have no limits on using the Gmail connector.

If you have logic apps that are affected by these changes, we will notify you through email about the affected logic apps.

## Non-compliant logic apps

Starting June 15, 2020, any non-compliant workflows will be disabled. You will have to make sure that your workflow uses only the approved connectors before you can enable your workflow again. Or, you can [follow the steps in this topic to update affected workflows](#affected-workflows), which help you create a Google client app that the Gmail connector can use for authentication.

## Google-approved connectors

Under this policy, when you use a Gmail consumer account, you can use the Gmail connector with a limited set of Google-approved services, which is subject to change. Our engineering teams continue working with Google to add more services to this list. For now, here are the Google-approved triggers, actions, and connectors that you can use with the Gmail connector in the same workflow:

* Logic Apps built-in triggers and actions: Control, Data Operations, Date Time, Liquid, Request, Schedule, Variables, XML

* Google services: Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Contacts, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Tasks

* Approved Microsoft services: Dynamics 365, Excel Online, Microsoft Teams, Office 365, OneDrive, and SharePoint Online

## Steps to take for affected workflows

If you have to use the Gmail connector with a Gmail consumer account and non-approved connectors in a workflow, you have the option to create and use your own Google app for personal or internal use in your enterprise. For this scenario, here are the high-level steps that you need to take:

* Create a Google client app, which you can use for OAuth authentication, by using the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com).

* In your Gmail connector, use the client ID and client secret values from your client app.

### Create Google client app

1. To create this app, use [Google's setup tool](https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=gmail&credential=client_key) and follow the instructions.

   For detailed steps, review the instructions in the [Gmail connector's technical reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/gmail/).

1. Provide these values when required:

   * Gmail scope: `https://mail.google.com`
   * Authorized domain: `azure-apim.net`
   * Redirect URI: `https://global.consent.azure-apim.net/consent`

When you're done, your screen looks like this example except you'll have your own **Client ID** and **Client secret** values, which you later use in your logic app.

### Use client app settings in logic app

To use the client ID and client secret from your Google client app in your Gmail trigger or action, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app in the Logic App Designer.

1. If you're adding a new Gmail trigger or action and creating an entirely new connection, continue to the next step. Otherwise, in the Gmail trigger or action, select **Change connection** > **Add new**, for example:

   ![Select "Change connection" > "Add new"](./media/connectors-google-data-security-privacy-policy/change-gmail-connection.png)

1. Provide your connection information, for example:

   ![Provide connection information](./media/connectors-google-data-security-privacy-policy/authentication-type-bring-your-own-application.png)

   | Property | Value | Description |
   |----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Authentication Type** | **Bring your own application** | Specifies that you'll use your own client app for authentication. |
   | **Client ID** | <*client-ID*> | The client ID from your Google client app |
   | **Client Secret** | <*client-secret*> | The client secret from your Google client app |
   ||||

1. When you're done, select **Sign in**.

   A page appears that shows the client app that you created. If you're using a Gmail consumer account, you might get a page that show your client app isn't verified by Google and prompts you to first allow access to your Google account.

   ![Prompt for access to your Google account](./media/connectors-google-data-security-privacy-policy/allow-access-authorized-domain.png)

1. If necessary, select **Allow**.

   You can now use the Gmail connector without restrictions in your logic app.
