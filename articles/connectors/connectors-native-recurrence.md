# Create, schedule, and run recurring tasks with the recurrence trigger

To repeat tasks based on a schedule, 
create a logic app workflow that starts the **Schedule - Recurrence** trigger. 
That way, your logic app runs and then repeats after each time interval passes. 

For example, you can create logic apps that schedule and run workflows like these tasks:

* Email a summary of all tweets with a specific hashtag within the past week.
* Schedule a workflow that runs a SQL stored procedure every day.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, 
you can [start with a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
Otherwise, you can [sign up for a Pay-As-You-Go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/).

* Basic knowledge about creating logic apps. 
Learn [how to create your first logic app](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md). 

## Add a recurrence trigger that starts your logic app workflow

A [*trigger*](../connectors/connectors-overview.md) is an 
event that you use to start a logic app workflow.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
Create a blank logic app. 

2. After Logic Apps Designer appears, in the search box, 
enter "recurrence" as your filter. From the results, 
select the **Schedule - Recurrence** trigger. 

   ![Schedule - Recurrence trigger](./media/connectors-native-recurrence/add-recurrence-trigger.png)

   Now this trigger is the first step in your logic app.

3. Set the interval and frequency for the recurrence. 
In this example, set these properties to every week. 

   ![Set interval and frequency](./media/connectors-native-recurrence/recurrence-trigger-details.png)

4. For more options, such as a start date and time, specific days, 
hours, or minutes, choose **Show advanced options**. 

   ![More options](./media/connectors-native-recurrence/recurrence-trigger-more-options.png)

   For example, you could specify that your logic app 
   doesn't start running until two weeks from today, 
   supposing that today is September 4, 2017.

   ![Advanced scheduling options](./media/connectors-native-recurrence/recurrence-trigger-more-options-details.png)

   If you set advanced options for days or times, 
   the trigger shows you a preview for your specified recurrence. 
   For example, this trigger runs weekly, on each Monday, at 10:30 AM, 
   12:30 PM, and 2:30 PM.

## Trigger details

You can configure these properties for the recurrence trigger.

| Display name | Property name | Required | Description | 
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ----------- | 
| **Frequency** | frequency | Yes | The unit of time: `Second`, `Minute`, `Hour`, `Day`, `Week`, or `Month` | 
| **Interval** | interval | Yes | The frequency interval for the recurrence | 
| **Time zone** | timeZone | No | If you provide a start time without a UTC offset, this time zone is used. | 
| **Start time** | startTime | No | The start time in [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) | 
| **On these days** | weekDays | No | Select one or more days of the week when you want to run the workflow: `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`, `Sunday` | 
| **At these hours** | hours | No | Select one or more hours for the times of day when you want to run the workflow. For example, "10", "12" and "14" are 10 AM, 12 PM, and 2 PM. | 
| **At these minutes** | minutes | No | Select one or minutes for the times of day when you want to run the workflow. For example, "30" is the half-hour mark. |
