# Create and manage Dynamics 365 records by using Azure Logic Apps

The Dynamics 365 connector is being deprecated and replaced by the [Common Data Service connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/commondataservice/), which has all the Dynamics 365 connector's capabilities plus improvements that increase reliability. [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) helps you securely store and manage data that's used by business apps, such as Dynamics 365.

* For new logic apps, use the Common Data Service connector instead. After deprecation, Dynamics 365 triggers and actions won't be available for you to include in logic apps. For more information about using the Common Data Service connector, see [Create and manage Common Data Service records by using Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/connect-common-data-service.md).

* For existing logic apps, you're not currently required to use the Common Data Service connector or stop using the Dynamics 365 connector, which continues to work at this time.

At some point, the [Common Data Service (*Current Environment*) connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/), which isn't available yet for Azure Logic Apps, will replace both the Dynamics 365 connector and the Common Data Service connector. At that time, both the Dynamics 365 and Common Data Service connectors will be removed. For more information, see the Power Platform blog post, [Dynamics 365 Connector is deprecated](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/important-changes-coming).
