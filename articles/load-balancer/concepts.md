# Azure Load Balancer concepts

Load balancer provides several capabilities for both UDP and TCP applications. 

## Load balancing algorithm
With Azure Load Balancer, you can create a load-balancing rule to distribute traffic that arrives at the frontend to backend pool instances. Load balancer uses a hashing algorithm for distribution of inbound flows (not bytes) and rewrites the headers of flows to backend pool instances. A server is available to receive new flows when a health probe indicates a healthy back-end endpoint.

By default, Load balancer uses a 5-tuple hash.

The hash includes:

- **Source IP address**
- **Source port**
- **Destination IP address**
- **Destination port**
- **IP protocol number to map flows to available servers**

You can create affinity to a source IP address by using a 2- or 3-tuple hash for a given rule. All packets of the same packet flow arrive on the same instance behind the load-balanced front end. When the client starts a new flow from the same source IP, the source port is changed. As a result, the 5-tuple hash might cause the traffic to go to a different backend endpoint.
For more information, see [Configure the distribution mode for Azure Load Balancer](./load-balancer-distribution-mode.md).

The following image displays the hash-based distribution:

## Application independence and transparency

 Load balancer doesn't directly interact with TCP or UDP or the application layer. Any TCP or UDP application scenario can be supported. Load balancer doesn't terminate or originate flows, interact with the payload of the flow, or provide any application layer gateway function. Protocol handshakes always occur directly between the client and the back-end pool instance. A response to an inbound flow is always a response from a virtual machine. When the flow arrives on the virtual machine, the original source IP address is also preserved.

* Every endpoint is only answered by a VM. For example, a TCP handshake always occurs between the client and the selected back-end VM. A response to a request to a front end is a response generated by a back-end VM. When you successfully validate connectivity to a front end, you're validating the end-to-end connectivity to at least one back-end virtual machine.
* Application payloads are transparent to the load balancer. Any UDP or TCP application can be supported.
* Because the load balancer doesn't interact with the TCP payload and provide TLS offload, you can build end-to-end encrypted scenarios. Using load balancer gains large scale-out for TLS applications by ending the TLS connection on the VM itself. For example, your TLS session keying capacity is only limited by the type and number of VMs you add to the back-end pool.

## Outbound connections 
All outbound flows from private IP addresses inside your virtual network to public IP addresses on the internet can be translated to a frontend IP address of the load balancer. When a public front end is tied to a backend VM by way of a load-balancing rule, Azure translates outbound connections to the public frontend IP address. This configuration has the following advantages:

* Easy upgrade and disaster recovery of services, because the front end can be dynamically mapped to another instance of the service.
* Easier access control list (ACL) management. ACLs expressed as front-end IPs don't change as services scale up or down or get redeployed. Translating outbound connections to a smaller number of IP addresses than machines reduces the burden of implementing safe recipient lists.

Standard load balancer utilizes a [robust, scalable, and predictable SNAT algorithm](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md#snat).These are the key tenets to remember when working with Standard load balancer
are outlined [here](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md).

## Availability Zones

Standard load balancer supports additional abilities in regions where Availability Zones are available. These features are incremental to all standard load balancer provides.  Availability Zones configurations are available for both types, public and internal standard load balancer.
 A zone-redundant frontend survives zone failure and is served by dedicated infrastructure in all of the zones simultaneously. 
Additionally, you can guarantee a frontend to a specific zone. A zonal frontend shares fate with the respective zone and is served only by dedicated infrastructure in a single zone.
Cross-zone load balancing is available for the backend pool, and any virtual machine resource in a virtual network can be part of a backend pool.
Basic load balancer does not support zones.
Review [detailed discussion of Availability Zones related abilities](load-balancer-standard-availability-zones.md) and [Availability Zones Overview](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) for more information.

## HA Ports

You can configure load-balancing rules to make your application scale and be highly reliable. When you use an HA ports load-balancing rule, standard load balancer will provide per flow load balancing on every ephemeral port of an internal standard load balancer's frontend IP address.  The feature is useful for other scenarios where it is impractical or undesirable to specify individual ports. An HA ports load-balancing rule allows you to create active-passive or active-active n+1 scenarios for network virtual appliances and any application, which requires large ranges of inbound ports.  A health probe can be used to determine which back-ends should be receiving new flows.  You can use a Network Security Group to emulate a port range scenario. Basic load balancer does not support HA Ports.
Review [detailed discussion of HA Ports](load-balancer-ha-ports-overview.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you are planning to use a network virtual appliance, check with your vendor for guidance on whether their product has been tested with HA Ports and follow their specific guidance for implementation. 

## Multiple frontends

Load Balancer supports multiple rules with multiple frontends.  Standard Load Balancer expands this to outbound scenarios.  Outbound scenarios are essentially the inverse of an inbound load-balancing rule.  The inbound load-balancing rule also creates an associate for outbound connections. Standard Load Balancer uses all frontends associated with a virtual machine resource through a load-balancing rule.  Additionally, a parameter on the load-balancing rule and allows you to suppress a load-balancing rule for the purposes of outbound connectivity, which allows the selection of specific frontends including none.

For comparison, Basic Load Balancer selects a single frontend at random and there is no ability to control which one was selected.

## <a name = "limitations"></a>Limitations

- SKUs are not mutable. You may not change the SKU of an existing resource.
- A standalone virtual machine resource, availability set resource, or virtual machine scale set resource can reference one SKU, never both.
- A load balancer rule cannot span two virtual networks.  Front-ends and their related backend instances must be located in the same virtual network.  
- [Move subscription operations](../azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription.md) are not supported for standard load balancer and public IP resources.
- Web Worker Roles without a virtual network and other Microsoft platform services can be accessible from instances behind only an internal standard load balancer. You must not rely on this as the respective service itself or the underlying platform can change without notice. You must always assume you need to create [outbound connectivity](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md) explicitly if desired when using an internal standard load balancer only.
- Load balancer provides load balancing and port forwarding for specific TCP or UDP protocols. Load-balancing rules and inbound NAT rules support TCP and UDP, but not other IP protocols including ICMP.

  Load Balancer doesn't terminate, respond, or otherwise interact with the payload of a UDP or TCP flow. It's not a proxy. Successful validation of connectivity to a front end must take place in-band with the same protocol used in a load balancing or inbound NAT rule. At least one of your virtual machines must generate a response for a client to see a response from a front end.
  Not receiving an in-band response from the load balancer front end indicates no virtual machines could respond. Nothing can interact with a load balancer front end without a virtual machine able to respond. This principle also applies to outbound connections where port masquerade SNAT is only supported for TCP and UDP. Any other IP protocols, including ICMP, fail. Assign an instance-level public IP address to mitigate this issue. For more information, see [Understanding SNAT and PAT](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md#snat).

- Internal load balancers don't translate outbound originated connections to the front end of an internal Load Balancer because both are in private IP address space. Public load balancers provide [outbound connections](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md) from private IP addresses inside the virtual network to public IP addresses. For internal load balancers, this approach avoids potential SNAT port exhaustion inside a unique internal IP address space, where translation isn't required.

  A side effect is that if an outbound flow from a VM in the back-end pool attempts a flow to front end of the internal Load Balancer in its pool _and_ is mapped back to itself, the two legs of the flow don't match. Because they don't match, the flow fails. The flow succeeds if the flow didn't map back to the same VM in the back-end pool that created the flow to the front end.
  When the flow maps back to itself, the outbound flow appears to originate from the VM to the front end and the corresponding inbound flow appears to originate from the VM to itself. From the guest operating system's point of view, the inbound and outbound parts of the same flow don't match inside the virtual machine. The TCP stack won't recognize these halves of the same flow as being part of the same flow. The source and destination don't match. When the flow maps to any other VM in the back-end pool, the halves of the flow do match and the VM can respond to the flow.
  The symptom for this scenario is intermittent connection timeouts when the flow returns to the same backend that originated the flow. Common workarounds include insertion of a proxy layer behind the internal load balancer and using Direct Server Return (DSR) style rules. For more information, see [Multiple Front ends for Azure Load Balancer](load-balancer-multivip-overview.md).

  You can combine an internal load balancer with any third-party proxy or use internal [Application Gateway](../application-gateway/application-gateway-introduction.md) for proxy scenarios with HTTP/HTTPS. While you could use a public load balancer to mitigate this issue, the resulting scenario is prone to [SNAT exhaustion](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md#snat). Avoid this second approach unless carefully managed.

- In general, forwarding IP fragments isn't supported on load-balancing rules. IP fragmentation of UDP and TCP packets isn't supported on load-balancing rules. HA ports load-balancing rules can be used to forward existing IP fragments. For more information, see [High availability ports overview](load-balancer-ha-ports-overview.md).
