# Azure Load Balancer overview

Azure Load Balancer delivers high availability and network performance to your applications. It is a Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming traffic among healthy instances of services defined in a load-balanced set.

## Why use Load Balancer? 

Azure Load Balancer can be used to:

* Load balance incoming Internet traffic to virtual machines. This configuration is known as [Public load balancing](#publicloadbalancer).
* Load balance traffic between virtual machines in a virtual network or between on-premises computers and virtual machines in a cross-premises virtual network. This configuration is known as [internal load balancing](#internalloadbalancer).
* Forward external traffic to a specific virtual machines.

## Load Balancer features

Load Balancer provides the following capabilities:

* Hash-based distribution

    Azure Load Balancer uses a hash-based distribution algorithm. By default, it uses a 5-tuple hash composed of source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol type to map traffic to available servers. It provides stickiness only *within* a transport session. Packets in the same TCP or UDP session will be directed to the same instance behind the load-balanced endpoint. When the client closes and reopens the connection or starts a new session from the same source IP, the source port changes. This may cause the traffic to go to a different endpoint in a different datacenter.

    For more details, see [Load balancer distribution mode](load-balancer-distribution-mode.md). The following graphic shows the hash-based distribution:

* Port forwarding

    Azure Load Balancer gives you control over how inbound communication is managed. This communication includes traffic initiated from Internet hosts, virtual machines in other cloud services, or virtual networks. This control is represented by an endpoint (also called an input endpoint).

    An input endpoint listens on a public port and forwards traffic to an internal port. You can map the same ports for an internal or external endpoint or use a different port for them. For example, you can have a web server configured to listen to port 81 while the public endpoint mapping is port 80. The creation of a public endpoint triggers the creation of a load balancer instance.

    When created using the Azure portal, the portal automatically creates endpoints to the virtual machine for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and remote Windows PowerShell session traffic. You can use these endpoints to remotely administer the virtual machine over the Internet.

* Automatic reconfiguration

    Azure Load Balancer instantly reconfigures itself when you scale instances up or down. For example, this reconfiguration happens when you increase the instance count for web/worker roles in a cloud service or when you add additional virtual machines into the same load-balanced set.

* Service monitoring

    Azure Load Balancer can probe the health of the various server instances. When a probe fails to respond, the load balancer stops sending new connections to the unhealthy instances. Existing connections are not impacted.

    Three types of probes are supported:

    + **Guest agent probe (on Platform as a Service Virtual Machines only):** The load balancer utilizes the guest agent inside the virtual machine. The guest agent listens and responds with an HTTP 200 OK response only when the instance is in the ready state (i.e. the instance is not in a state like busy, recycling, or stopping). If the agent fails to respond with an HTTP 200 OK, the load balancer marks the instance as unresponsive and stops sending traffic to that instance. The load balancer continues to ping the instance. If the guest agent responds with an HTTP 200, the load balancer will send traffic to that instance again. When you're using a web role, your website code typically runs in w3wp.exe, which is not monitored by the Azure fabric or guest agent. This means that failures in w3wp.exe (e.g. HTTP 500 responses) will not be reported to the guest agent, and the load balancer will not know to take that instance out of rotation.
    + **HTTP custom probe:** This probe overrides the default (guest agent) probe. You can use it to create your own custom logic to determine the health of the role instance. The load balancer will regularly probe your endpoint (every 15 seconds, by default). The instance is considered to be in rotation if it responds with a TCP ACK or HTTP 200 within the timeout period (default of 31 seconds). This is useful for implementing your own logic to remove instances from the load balancer's rotation. For example, you can configure the instance to return a non-200 status if the instance is above 90% CPU. For web roles that use w3wp.exe, you also get automatic monitoring of your website, since failures in your website code return a non-200 status to the probe.
    + **TCP custom probe:** This probe relies on successful TCP session establishment to a defined probe port.

    For more information, see the [LoadBalancerProbe schema](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj151530.aspx).

* Source NAT

    All outbound traffic to the Internet that originates from your service undergoes source NAT (SNAT) by using the same VIP address as the incoming traffic. SNAT provides important benefits:

    + It enables easy upgrade and disaster recovery of services, since the VIP can be dynamically mapped to another instance of the service.
    + It makes access control list (ACL) management easier. ACLs expressed in terms of VIPs do not change as services scale up, down, or get redeployed.

    The load balancer configuration supports full cone NAT for UDP. Full cone NAT is a type of NAT where the port allows inbound connections from any external host (in response to an outbound request).

    For each new outbound connection that a virtual machine initiates, an outbound port is also allocated by the load balancer. The external host sees traffic with a virtual IP (VIP)-allocated port. For scenarios that require a large number of outbound connections, it is recommended to use [instance-level public IP](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-instance-level-public-ip.md) addresses so that the VMs have a dedicated outbound IP address for SNAT. This reduces the risk of port exhaustion.

    Please see [outbound connections](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md) article for more details on this topic.


## Load Balancer SKUs
Azure Load Balancer supports two different SKUs: [Basic](#basicloadbalancer) and [Standard](#standardloadbalancer).

### <a name = "basicloadbalancer"></a>Why use Basic Load Balancer?


### <a name = "standardloadbalancer"></a>Why use Standard Load Balancer?

The Azure Load Balancer Standard SKU and Public IP Standard SKU together enable you to build highly scalable and reliable architectures. Applications that use Load Balancer Standard can take advantage of new capabilities. Low latency, high throughput, and scale are available for millions of flows for all TCP and UDP applications. You can use Load Balancer Standard for the full range of virtual data centers. From small scale deployments to large and complex multi-zone architectures, use Load Balancer Standard to take advantage of the following capabilities:

- Enterprise scale can be achieved with Load Balancer Standard. This feature can be used with any virtual machine (VM) instance within a virtual network, up to 1,000 VM instances.

- New diagnostic insights are available to help you understand, manage, and troubleshoot this vital component of your virtual data center. Use Azure Monitor (preview) to show, filter, and group new multi-dimensional metrics for continuous data path health measurements. Monitor your data from front-end to VM, endpoint health probes, for TCP connection attempts, and to outbound connections.

- Network Security Groups (NSGs) are now required for any VM instance that is associated with Load Balancer Standard SKUs or Public IP Standard SKUs. NSGs provide enhanced security for your scenario.

- High Availability (HA) Ports provide high reliability and scale for network virtual appliances (NVAs) and other application scenarios. HA Ports load balance all ports on an Azure Internal Load Balancer (ILB) front-end to a pool of VM instances.

- Outbound connections now use a new Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) port allocation model that provides greater resiliency and scale.

- Load Balancer Standard with Availability Zones can be used to construct zone-redundant and zonal architectures. Both of these architectures can include cross-zone load balancing. You can achieve zone-redundancy without dependency on DNS records. A single IP address is zone-redundant by default.  A single IP address can reach any VM in a virtual network within a region that is across all Availability Zones.

You can use Load Balancer Standard either in a public or internal configuration to support the following fundamental scenarios:

- Load balance inbound traffic to healthy back-end instances.
- Port forward inbound traffic to a single back-end instance.
- Translate outbound traffic from a private IP address within the virtual network to a Public IP address.

## Load Balancer resources

Load Balancer contains the following child resources that you can configure to address your load balancing requirements:

* **Frontend IP configuration** – a Load balancer can include one or more frontend IP addresses, otherwise known as a virtual IPs (VIPs). These IP addresses serve as ingress for the traffic.
* **Backend address pool** – these are IP addresses associated with the virtual machine Network Interface Card (NIC) to which load is distributed.
* **Load balancing rules** – a rule property maps a given frontend IP and port combination to a set of backend IP addresses and port combination. A single load balancer can have multiple load balancing rules. Each rule is a combination of a frontend IP and port and backend IP and port associated with VMs.
* **Health probes** – probes enable you to keep track of the health of VM instances. If a health probe fails, the VM instance is taken out of rotation automatically.
* **Inbound NAT rules** – NAT rules define the inbound traffic flowing through the frontend IP and distributed to the backend IP.

## Load Balancer types
Azure Load Balancer supports two types of load balancing - public and internal.

### <a name = "publicloadbalancer"></a>Public Load Balancer

Public Load Balancer maps the public IP address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP address and port number of the virtual machine and vice versa for the response traffic from the virtual machine. Load balancing rules allow you to distribute specific types of traffic between multiple virtual machines or services. For example, you can spread the load of web request traffic across multiple web servers.

The following figure shows a load-balanced endpoint for web traffic that is shared among three virtual machines for the public and private TCP port of 80. These three virtual machines are in a load-balanced set.

![public load balancer example](./media/load-balancer-overview/IC727496.png)

**Figure 1: Load balancing web traffic using a public Load Balancer**

When Internet clients send web page requests to the public IP address of a web app on TCP port 80, the Azure Load Balancer distributes the requests between the three virtual machines in the load-balanced set. For more information about load balancer algorithms, see the [load balancer overview page](load-balancer-overview.md#load-balancer-features).

By default, Azure Load Balancer distributes network traffic equally among multiple virtual machine instances. You can also configure session affinity, For more information, see [load balancer distribution mode](load-balancer-distribution-mode.md).

### <a name = "internalloadbalancer"></a> Internal Load Balancer?

Internal Load Balancer only directs traffic to resources that are inside a virtual network or that use a VPN to access Azure infrastructure. In this respect, internal Load Balancer differs from a public Load Balancer. Azure infrastructure restricts access to the load-balanced frontend IP addresses of a virtual network. Frontend IP addresses and virtual networks are never directly exposed to an internet endpoint. Internal line-of-business applications run in Azure and are accessed from within Azure or from on-premises resources.

Internal Load Balancer enables the following types of load balancing:

* Within a virtual network: Load balancing from VMs in the virtual network to a set of VMs that reside within the same virtual network.
* For a cross-premises virtual network: Load balancing from on-premises computers to a set of VMs that reside within the same virtual network. 
* For multi-tier applications: Load balancing for internet-facing multi-tier applications where the back-end tiers are not internet-facing. The back-end tiers require traffic load balancing from the internet-facing tier (see figure 2).
* For line-of-business applications: Load balancing for line-of-business applications that are hosted in Azure without additional load balancer hardware or software. This scenario includes on-premises servers that are in the set of computers whose traffic is load-balanced.
