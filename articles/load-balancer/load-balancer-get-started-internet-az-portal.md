#  Create a zone-redundant Public Load Balancer Standard with the Azure portal

This article steps through creating a Public Load Balancer Standard with a zone-redundant frontend Public IP Standard address. An [availability zone] (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/availability-zones/az-overview) is a physically separate zone in an Azure region.

>[!NOTE]
Load Balancer Standard SKU is currently in Preview. During preview, the feature may not have the same level of availability and reliability as features that are in general availability release. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). Use the Generally Available [Load Balancer Basic SKU](load-balancer-overview.md) for your production services.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Register for Availability Zones, Load Balancer Standard, and Public IP Standard Preview

Availability zones are currently in preview release. Before selecting a zone or zone-redundant option for the frontend Public IP Address for the Load Balancer, you must first complete the steps in [register for the availability zones preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/availability-zones/az-overview).
 
The Standard SKU is in preview release. Before creating a Standard SKU public IP address, you must first complete the steps in [register for the standard SKU preview](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-public-ip-address?branch=pr-en-us-23006#register-for-the-standard-sku-preview) and create the public IP address in a supported location (region). For a list of supported locations, see [Region availability](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) and monitor the [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?product=virtual-network) updates page for additional region support
