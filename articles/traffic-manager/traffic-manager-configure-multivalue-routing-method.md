# Direct traffic to IPv4/IPv6 endpoints using Traffic Manager

This article describes how to configure the multivalue traffic-routing method. The **Multivalue** traffic routing method allows you to direct traffic to traffic to A/AAAA endpoint and helps increase the reliability of your application since clients have multiple healthy endpoint options to retry without having to do another DNS lookup. 
When a query is received for this profile, all healthy endpoints are returned based on the maximum return count specified. 


## Sign in to Azure 

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.
## Create a resource group
Create a resource group for the Traffic Manager profile.
1. On the left pane of the Azure portal, select **Resource groups**.
2. In **Resource groups**, on the top of the page, select **Add**.
3. In **Resource group name**, type a name *myResourceGroupTM1*. For **Resource group location**, select **East US**, and then select **OK**.

## Create a Traffic Manager profile
Create a Traffic Manager profile that directs user traffic by sending them to the endpoint with lowest latency.

1. On the top left-hand side of the screen, select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Traffic Manager profile** > **Create**.
2. In **Create Traffic Manager profile**, enter or select, the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **Create**:
    | Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |
    | Name                   | This name needs to be unique within the trafficmanager.net zone and results in the DNS name, trafficmanager.net that is used to access your Traffic Manager profile.                                   |
    | Routing method          | Select the **Multivalue** routing method.                                       |
    | Subscription            | Select your subscription.                          |
    | Resource group          | Select *myResourceGroupTM1*. |
    | Location                | This setting refers to the location of the resource group, and has no impact on the Traffic Manager profile that will be deployed globally.                              |

## Add Traffic Manager endpoints

Add two IP addresses as external endpoints to the multivalue traffic manager profile that you created in the preceding step.

1. In the portalâ€™s search bar, search for the Traffic Manager profile name that you created in the preceding section and select the profile in the results that the displayed.
2. In **Traffic Manager profile**, in the **Settings** section, click **Endpoints**, and then click **Add**.
3. Enter, or select, the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **OK**:

    | Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |
    | Type                    | External endpoint                                   |
    | Name           | myEndpoint1                                        |
    | Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP           | Type the Public IP address of the endpoint that you want to add to this Traffic Manager profile                         |
    |        |           |

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add another endpoint named *myEndpoint2*, for **Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP**, enter the public IP address of the second endpoint.
5.	When the addition of both endpoints is complete, they are displayed in **Traffic Manager profile** along with their monitoring status as **Online**.
