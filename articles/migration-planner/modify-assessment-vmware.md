# Modify assessment values for VMware VM migration

[Azure Migration Planner](migration-planner-overview.md) runs assessments for migration to Azure using default settings. After running an assessment, follow the instructions in this article if you want to modify those defaults.

Post any comments or questions at the bottom of this article.

## Edit assessment values

1. In **Assessments**, select the assessment, and click **Settings**.
2. In the **Settings** tab, modify the values in accordance with the table below.

## Assessment values

**Value** | **Details** | **Default**
--- | --- | ---
**Target location** | The Azure location to which you migrate. | By default this is the location in which you create the migration project you created.
**Storage redundancy** | The type of storage that the Azure VMs will use after migration. | Only [Locally redundant storage (LRS)](../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md#locally-redundant-storage) is currently available.
**Size** | Azure VM size | This is the size that Migration Planner recommends for the machine in Azure.
**Comfort factor** | Comfort factor to consider during assessment. It accounts for things such as seasonal usage, short performance history, likely increase in future usage.<br/><br/> For example, normally a 10-core VM with 20% utilization will result in a 2-core VM. But if it has a comfort factor of 2.0, the result will be a 4-core VM. | Default setting is 1.3.
**Perfomance history** | Time used in evaluating performance history. | Default is one month.
**Percentile utilization** | Percentile value of perfomance history. | Default used is 95%.
**Software assurance** | Indicates whether you're enrolled in [Azure Hybrid Use Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-use-benefit/). If set to **Yes**, non-Windows Azure prices are considered for Windows VMs. | Set by default to Yes.
**Pricing tier** | VMs are offered on a [tier system](../virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general.md), to meet exact requirements. | By default the [Standard](../virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general.md) tier is used.
**Offer** | Azure offers that apply. | Only [pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) is currently available.
**Currency** | Billing currency | Only US dollars are currently supported.
**Stage** | Indicates whether you want to maintain the assessment status in order to review it with stakeholders. | The default setting is **In progress**. You can move it to **Under review** after you start the review, and then to **Approved** after the review is done.
