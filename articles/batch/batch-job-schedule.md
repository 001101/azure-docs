# Schedule jobs for efficiency

Scheduling Batch jobs enables you to prioritize the jobs you want to run first while taking into account tasks that have dependencies on other tasks. By scheduling your jobs you can make sure you use the least amount of resources. Nodes can be decommissioned when not needed, tasks that are dependent on other tasks are spun up just in time optimizing the workflows.
