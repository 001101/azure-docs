# Run your first Batch job in the portal

This quickstart shows how to use the Azure portal to create a Batch account, a *pool* of compute nodes (virtual machines), and a *job* that runs *tasks* on the pool. The pool in this example contains Windows VMs, but Batch also supports Linux pools to run Linux jobs. Each sample task displays environment variables set by Batch on a compute node. This example is basic but introduces you to key concepts of the Batch service. 

## Log in to Azure 

Log in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

## Create Batch account

Follow these steps to create a sample Batch account for test purposes. You need an account to create Batch pools and Batch jobs. As shown here, you can link an Azure storage account with the Batch account, which is useful to deploy applications and store input and output data.


1. Click **Create a resource** > **Compute** > **Batch Service**. 

  ![Batch in the Marketplace][marketplace_portal]

2. Enter values for **Account name** and **Resource group**. The account name must be unique within the Azure **Location** selected, use only lowercase characters or numbers, and contain 3-24 characters. 

3. In **Storage account**, select an existing general-purpose storage account or create a new one.

4. Keep the defaults for remaining settings, and click **Create** to create the account.

  ![Create a Batch account][account_portal]  


When the **Deployment succeeded** message appears, go to the Batch account in the portal.

## Create a Batch pool

Create a sample pool of Windows VMs for test purposes. The pool for this quick example consists of 2 size A1 nodes running Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter from the Azure Marketplace. 


1. In the Batch account, click **Pools** > **Add**.

2. Enter a **Pool ID**, such as *mypool*. 
3. In **Operating System**, select the following settings (you can explore other options):

  * **Image Type** - Marketplace (Linux/Windows)
  
  * **Publisher** - MicrosoftWindowsServer

  * **Offer** - WindowsServer

  * **Sku** - 2016-Datacenter

  ![Select a pool operating system][pool_os] 

4. Scroll down to add **Node Size** and **Scale** settings:
  * In **Node pricing tier**, select *Standard_A1*. This size offers a good balance of performance versus cost for this quick example.
  * In **Target dedicated nodes**, enter 2. 

  ![Select a pool size][pool_size] 

5. Keep the defaults for remaining settings, and click **OK** to create the pool.

While the compute nodes are starting, you see an **Allocation state** of **Resizing**. You can go ahead and create a job and tasks while the pool is resizing. After a few minutes, the state of the nodes is **Steady**, indicating they are ready to run tasks. 



## Create a Batch job

A Batch job specifies a pool to run tasks on and optional settings such as a priority and schedule for the work. The following example creates a job on the pool you created. Initially the job has no tasks.

1. In the account view, click **Jobs** > **Add**. 

2. Enter a **Job ID**, such as *myjob*. In **Pool**, select the pool you created. Keep the defaults for the remaining settings, and click **OK**.

  ![Create a job][job_create]

After the job is created, the **Tasks** page opens.

## Create tasks

Now create sample tasks to run in the job. Typically you create multiple tasks that Batch queues and distributes to run on the compute nodes. In this example, you create two identical tasks. Each task runs a **Command line** to display the Batch environment variables on a compute node, and then waits 90 seconds. 

When you use Batch, the **Command line** is where you specify your app or script. Batch provides a number of ways to deploy apps and scripts to compute nodes. 

To create the first task:

1. Click **Add**.

2. Enter a **Task ID**, such as *mytask*. 

3. In **Command line**, enter `cmd /c "set AZ_BATCH & timeout /t 90 > NUL"`. Keep the defaults for the remaining settings, and click **OK**.

  ![Create a task][task_create]

After the task is created, it starts running on one of the nodes in the pool.

To create a second task, go back to step 1. Enter a different **Task ID**, but specify an identical command line. If the first task is still running, Batch starts the second task on the other node in the pool.

## View task output

The preceding task examples complete in a couple of minutes. To view the output of one of the tasks, click **Files on node**, and then select the file `stdout.txt`. This file shows the standard output of the task. The contents are similar to the following:


![View task output][task_output]

The contents show the Azure Batch environment variables that are set on the node. When you create your own Batch jobs and tasks, you can reference these environment variables in task command lines, and in the apps and scripts run by the command lines.




## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, Batch account, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group for the Batch account and click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a Batch account, a Batch pool, and a Batch job. The job ran sample tasks, and you viewed output created on one of the nodes. To learn more about Azure Batch, continue to the Batch tutorials.
