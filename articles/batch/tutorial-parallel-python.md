# Process media files in parallel with Azure Batch using the Python API

Azure Batch enables you to run large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs efficiently in Azure. This tutorial covers building a Python sample application step by step to run a parallel workload using Batch. In this tutorial, you convert media files in parallel using the [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) open-source tool. You learn a common Batch application workflow and how to interact programmatically with Batch and Storage resources. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Authenticate with Batch and Storage accounts
> * Upload input data files to Storage
> * Create a Batch pool to run ffmpeg
> * Create a job and tasks to process input files
> * Monitor task execution
> * Retrieve output files

## Prerequisites

* [Python version 2.7 or 3.3 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* An Azure Batch account and a linked general-purpose Azure Storage account. To create these accounts, see the Batch quickstarts using the [Azure portal](quick-create-portal.md) or [Azure CLI](quick-create-cli.md). 

## Download the sample

[Download or clone the sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/batch-python-ffmpeg-tutorial) from GitHub. 

Change to the directory that contains the sample code:

```bash
cd src
```
Install the required packages using `pip`.

```bash
pip install azure-batch
pip install azure-storage
```

[!INCLUDE [batch-common-credentials](../../includes/batch-common-credentials.md)]

Open the file `batch_python_tututorial_ffmpeg.py` in a text editor. Update the Batch and storage account credential strings with the values unique to your accounts. For example:


```Python
_BATCH_ACCOUNT_NAME = 'mybatchaccount'
_BATCH_ACCOUNT_KEY = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxE+yXrRvJAqT9BlXwwo1CwF+SwAYOxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx43pXi/gdiATkvbpLRl3x14pcEQ=='
_BATCH_ACCOUNT_URL = 'https://mybatchaccount.westeurope.batch.azure.com'
_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME = 'mystorageaccount'
_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxy4/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfwpbIC5aAWA8wDu+AFXZB827Mt9lybZB1nUcQbQiUrkPtilK5BQ=='
```

The following sections break down the sample application into the steps that it performs to process a workload in the Batch service. Refer to the Python code while you work your way through the rest of this article, since not every line of code in the sample is discussed.

## Blob and Batch clients

* To interact with the linked storage account, the app uses the [azure-storage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-storage) package to create a [BlockBlobService](/python/api/azure.storage.blob.blockblobservice.blockblobservice) object.

  ```python
  blob_client = azureblob.BlockBlobService(
      account_name=STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME,
      account_key=STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY)
  ```

* The app creates a [BatchServiceClient](/python/api/azure.batch.batchserviceclient) object to create and manage pools, jobs, and tasks in the Batch service. The Batch client in the sample uses shared key authentication. Batch also supports authentication through [Azure Active Directory](batch-aad-auth.md), to authenticate individual users or an unattended application.

  ```python
  credentials = batchauth.SharedKeyCredentials(_BATCH_ACCOUNT_NAME,
     _BATCH_ACCOUNT_KEY)

  batch_client = batch.BatchServiceClient(
        credentials,
        base_url=_BATCH_ACCOUNT_URL)
  ```

## Upload input files


The app uses the `blob_client` reference create a storage container for the input MP4 files and a container for the task output. Then, it calls the `upload-file_to_container` function to upload input MP4 files to the container. The files in storage are defined as Batch [ResourceFile](/python/api/azure.batch.models.resourcefile) objects that Batch can later download to compute nodes.

```python

blob_client.create_container(input_container_name, fail_on_exist=False)
blob_client.create_container(output_container_name, fail_on_exist=False)
input_file_paths = []
    
for folder, subs, files in os.walk('./InputFiles/'):
    for filename in files:
        if filename.endswith(".mp4"):
            input_file_paths.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(folder, filename)))

# Upload the input files. This is the collection of files that are to be processed by the tasks. 
input_files = [
    upload_file_to_container(blob_client, input_container_name, file_path)
    for file_path in input_file_paths]
```


## Create a Batch pool

Next, the sample creates a pool of compute nodes in the Batch account with a call to `create_pool`. This defined function uses the Batch [PoolAddParameter](/python/api/azure.batch.models.pooladdparameter) method to set the number of nodes, VM size, and a pool configuration. Here, a [VirtualMachineConfiguration](/python/api/azure.batch.models.virtualmachineconfiguration) object specifies an [ImageReference](/python/api/azure.batch.models.imagereference) to an Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS image published in the Azure Marketplace. Batch supports a wide range of Linux and Windows Server images in the Azure Marketplace, as well as custom VM images.

The number of nodes and VM size are set using defined constants. Batch supports dedicated nodes and [low-priority nodes](batch-low-pri-vms.md), and you can use either or both in your pools. Dedicated nodes are reserved for your pool. Low-priority nodes are offered at a reduced price from surplus VM capacity in Azure. Low-priority nodes become unavailable if Azure does not have enough capacity. The sample by default creates a pool of 5 low-priority nodes in size *Standard_A1_v2*. 

In addition to physical node properties, this pool configuration includes a [StartTask](/python/api/azure.batch.models.starttask) object. The StartTask executes on each node as that node joins the pool, and each time a node is restarted. In this example, the StartTask runs Bash shell commands to install the ffmpeg package and dependencies on the nodes.

The [pool.add](/python/api/azure.batch.operations.pooloperations#azure_batch_operations_PoolOperations_add) method submits the pool to the Batch service.

```python
new_pool = batch.models.PoolAddParameter(
    id=pool_id,
    virtual_machine_configuration=batchmodels.VirtualMachineConfiguration(
        image_reference=batchmodels.ImageReference(
            publisher="Canonical",
            offer="UbuntuServer",
            sku="16.04.0-LTS",
            version="latest"
            ),
        node_agent_sku_id="batch.node.ubuntu 16.04"),
    vm_size=_POOL_VM_SIZE,
    target_dedicated_nodes=_DEDICATED_POOL_NODE_COUNT,
    target_low_priority_nodes=_LOW_PRIORITY_POOL_NODE_COUNT,
    start_task=batchmodels.StartTask(
        command_line="/bin/bash -c \"add-apt-repository -y ppa:djcj/hybrid && apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg\"",
        wait_for_success=True,
        user_identity=batchmodels.UserIdentity(
            auto_user=batchmodels.AutoUserSpecification(
                scope=batchmodels.AutoUserScope.pool,
                elevation_level=batchmodels.ElevationLevel.admin)),
    )
)
try:
    batch_service_client.pool.add(new_pool)
except batchmodels.batch_error.BatchErrorException as err:
    print_batch_exception(err)
    raise
```

## Create a Batch job

A Batch job specifies a pool to run tasks on and optional settings such as a priority and schedule for the work. The sample creates a job with a call to `create_job`. This defined function uses the [JobAddParameter](/python/api/azure.batch.models.jobaddparameter) method to create a job on your pool. The [job.add](/python/api/azure.batch.operations.joboperations#azure_batch_operations_JobOperations_add) method submits the pool to the Batch service. Initially the job has no tasks.

```python
job = batch.models.JobAddParameter(
    job_id,
    batch.models.PoolInformation(pool_id=pool_id))

try:
    batch_service_client.job.add(job)
except batchmodels.batch_error.BatchErrorException as err:
    print_batch_exception(err)
    raise
```

### Create tasks

The app creates tasks in the job with a call to `add_tasks`. This defined function creates a list of task objects using the [TaskAddParameter](/python/api/azure.batch.models.taskaddparameter) method. Each task runs ffmpeg to process an input `resource_files` object using a `command_line` parameter. ffmpeg was previously installed on each node when the pool was created. Here, the command line runs ffmpeg to convert each input MP4 (video) file to an MP3 (audio) file.

The sample creates an [OutputFile](/python/api/azure.batch.models.outputfile) object for the MP3 file generated by each task. Each task's output files (one, in this case) are uploaded to a container in the linked storage account, using the task's `output_files` property.

Then, the app adds tasks to the job with the [task.add_collection](/python/api/azure.batch.operations.taskoperations#azure_batch_operations_TaskOperations_add_collection) method, which queues them to run on the compute nodes. 

```python
tasks = list()

for idx, input_file in enumerate(input_files): 

    input_file_path=input_file.file_path
    output_file_path="".join((input_file_path).split('.')[:-1]) + '.mp3'
    command = "/bin/bash -c \"ffmpeg -i {} {} \"".format(input_file_path, output_file_path)
    tasks.append(batch.models.TaskAddParameter(
        id='Task{}'.format(idx),
        command_line=command,
        resource_files=[input_file],
        output_files=[batchmodels.OutputFile(output_file_path,
              destination=batchmodels.OutputFileDestination(
                container=batchmodels.OutputFileBlobContainerDestination(output_container_sas_url)),
              upload_options=batchmodels.OutputFileUploadOptions(
                batchmodels.OutputFileUploadCondition.task_success))]
            )
     )
batch_service_client.task.add_collection(job_id, tasks)
```    

## Monitor tasks

When tasks are added to a job, Batch automatically queues and schedules them for execution on compute nodes in the associated pool. Based on the settings you specify, Batch handles all task queuing, scheduling, retrying, and other task administration duties. 

There are many approaches to monitoring task execution. The `wait_for_tasks_to_complete` function in this example uses the [TaskState](/python/api/azure.batch.models.taskstate) object to monitor tasks for a certain state, in this case the completed state.

## Run the app

When you run the sample application, the console output is similar to the following. During execution, you experience a pause at `Awaiting task completion, timeout in 00:30:00...` while the pool's compute nodes are started. 
   
```
Sample start: 12/12/2017 3:20:21 PM

Sample end: 12/12/2017 3:29:36 PM
Elapsed time: 00:09:14.3418742
```

Typical execution time is approximately **5 minutes** when you run the application in its default configuration. Pool creation takes the most time. Go to your Batch account in the Azure portal to monitor the pool, compute nodes, job, and tasks. For example, to see a heat map of the compute nodes in your pool:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **All services** > **Batch accounts** and then click the name of your Batch account.
3. Click **Pools** > *LinuxFFmpegPool*.

When tasks are running, the heat map is similar to the following:

[!INCLUDE [batch-common-tutorial-download](../../includes/batch-common-tutorial-download.md)]

## Clean up resources

After it runs the tasks, the app automatically deletes the input storage container it created, and gives you the option to delete the Batch pool and job. The BatchClient's [JobOperations](/python/api/azure.batch.operations.joboperations) and [PoolOperations](/python/api/azure.batch.operations.pooloperations) classes both have delete methods, which are called if you confirm deletion. Although you're not charged for jobs and tasks themselves, you are charged for compute nodes. Thus, we recommend that you allocate pools only as needed. When you delete the pool, all task output on the nodes is deleted. However, the input and output files remain in the storage account.

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, Batch account, and storage account. To do so in the Azure portal, select the resource group for the Batch account and click **Delete resource group**.
