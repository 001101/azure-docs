# Run your first Batch job using the .NET API

This quickstart runs an Azure Batch job from an application built on the Azure Batch .NET API. The app uploads some input data files to Azure storage and creates a *pool* of Batch compute nodes (virtual machines). Then, it creates a sample *job* that runs *tasks* to process each input file on the pool. 

Each sample task displays the contents of the file downloaded to the compute node. This example is basic but introduces key concepts of the Batch service.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/) or a more recent version. 
* A Batch account and a linked general-purpose storage account. To create these accounts, see the Batch quickstarts using the [Azure portal](quick-create-portal.md) or [Azure CLI](quick-create-cli.md). 

## Download the sample

[Download or clone the sample solution](https://github.com/dlepow/batchmvc) from GitHub.

Change to the directory that contains the Visual Studio solution:

```
cd quickstart_dotnet
```

[!INCLUDE [batch-common-credentials](../../includes/batch-common-credentials.md)]

Open the solution in Visual Studio, and update the following strings in `program.cs`:
```csharp
// Batch account credentials
private const string BatchAccountName = "mybatchaccount";
private const string BatchAccountKey  = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxE+yXrRvJAqT9BlXwwo1CwF+SwAYOxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx43pXi/gdiATkvbpLRl3x14pcEQ==";
private const string BatchAccountUrl  = "https://mybatchaccount.westus2.batch.azure.com";

// Storage account credentials
private const string StorageAccountName = "mystorageaccount";
private const string StorageAccountKey  = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxy4/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfwpbIC5aAWA8wDu+AFXZB827Mt9lybZB1nUcQbQiUrkPtilK5BQ==";
```

## Build and run the app

To see the Batch workflow in action, build and run the application. After running the application, go to the walkthrough to learn what each part of the application does. 


* Right-click the solution in Solution Explorer, and click **Build Solution**. 
* Confirm the restoration of any NuGet packages, if you're prompted. If you need to download missing packages, ensure the [NuGet Package Manager](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/installing-nuget) is installed.

When you run the sample application, the console output is similar to the following. During execution, you experience a pause at `Awaiting task completion, timeout in 00:30:00...` while the pool's compute nodes are started. Tasks are queued to run as soon as the first compute node is running. Go to your Batch account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to monitor the pool, compute nodes, job, and tasks.

```
Sample start: 12/4/2017 4:02:54 PM

Container [input] created.
Uploading file taskdata0.txt to container [input]...
Uploading file taskdata1.txt to container [input]...
Uploading file taskdata2.txt to container [input]...
Creating pool [DotNetQuickstartPool]...
Creating job [DotNetQuickstartJob]...
Adding 3 tasks to job [DotNetQuickstartJob]...
Awaiting task completion, timeout in 00:30:00...
```

After tasks complete, you see output similar to the following for each task:

```
Printing task output.
Task Task0

stdout:
Processing file taskdata0.txt in task Task0:
Batch processing began with mainframe computers and punch cards. Today it still plays a central role in business, engineering, science, and other pursuits that require running lots of automated tasks....
stderr:
...
```

Typical execution time is approximately 5 minutes when you run the application in its default configuration. Initial pool setup takes the most time. To run the job again, delete the job from the previous run and do not delete the pool. On a preconfigured pool, the job completes in a few seconds.



## Walkthrough

The .NET app in this quickstart does the following:

* Uploads three small text files to a blob container in your Azure storage account. These files are inputs for processing by Batch.
* Creates a pool of two compute nodes running Windows Server.
* Creates a job and three tasks to run on the nodes. Each task processes one of the input files using a Windows command line. 
* Displays files returned by each task.


See the file `Program.cs` and the following sections for details. 

### Preliminaries

* To interact with a storage account, the app uses the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET. It creates a reference to the account with [CloudStorageAccount](/dotnet/api/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.cloudstorageaccount), and from that creates a [CloudBlobClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob.cloudblobclient).

  ```csharp
  CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();
  ```

* The app uses the `blobClient` reference to create a container in the storage account and to upload data files to the container. The files in storage are defined as Batch [ResourceFile](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.resourcefile) objects that Batch can later download to compute nodes.

  ```csharp
  List<string> inputFilePaths = new List<string>
  {
      @"..\..\taskdata0.txt",
      @"..\..\taskdata1.txt",
      @"..\..\taskdata2.txt"
  };
  
  List<ResourceFile> inputFiles = new List<ResourceFile>();
    
  foreach (string filePath in inputFilePaths)
  {
      inputFiles.Add(UploadFileToContainer(blobClient, inputContainerName, filePath));
  }
  ```
* The app creates a [BatchClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.batchclient) object to create and manage pools, jobs, and tasks in the Batch service. The Batch client in the sample uses shared key authentication. Batch also supports Azure Active Directory authentication.

  ```csharp
  BatchSharedKeyCredentials cred = new BatchSharedKeyCredentials(BatchAccountUrl, BatchAccountName, BatchAccountKey);

  BatchClient batchClient = BatchClient.Open(cred);
  ```

### Create a Batch pool

To create a Batch pool, the app uses the [BatchClient.PoolOperations.CreatePool](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.pooloperations.createpool) method to set the number of nodes, VM size, and a pool configuration. Here, a [VirtualMachineConfiguration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.virtualmachineconfiguration) object specifies an [ImageReference](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.imagereference) to a Windows Server image published in the Azure Marketplace. Batch supports a wide range of Linux and Windows Server images in the Azure Marketplace, as well as custom VM images.

The number of nodes (`PoolNodeCount`) and VM size (`PoolVMSize`) are defined constants. The sample by default creates a pool of 2 size *Standard_A1_v2* nodes. The size suggested offers a good balance of performance versus cost for this quick example. 

The [Commit](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.cloudpool.commit) method submits the pool to the Batch service.

```csharp
ImageReference imageReference = new ImageReference(
    publisher: "MicrosoftWindowsServer",
    offer: "WindowsServer",
    sku: "2012-R2-Datacenter",
    version: "latest");

VirtualMachineConfiguration virtualMachineConfiguration =
new VirtualMachineConfiguration(
   imageReference: imageReference,
   nodeAgentSkuId: "batch.node.windows amd64"
   );

try
{
    CloudPool pool = batchClient.PoolOperations.CreatePool(
    poolId: PoolId,
    targetDedicatedComputeNodes: PoolNodeCount,
    virtualMachineSize: PoolVMSize,
    virtualMachineConfiguration: virtualMachineConfiguration
    );

    pool.Commit();
}
...

```
### Create a Batch job

A Batch job specifies a pool to run tasks on and optional settings such as a priority and schedule for the work. The app uses the [BatchClient.JobOperations.CreateJob](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.joboperations.createjob) method to create a job on your pool. 

The [Commit](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.cloudjob.commit) method submits the job to the Batch service. Initially the job has no tasks.

```csharp
CloudJob job = batchClient.JobOperations.CreateJob();
    job.Id = JobId;
    job.PoolInformation = new PoolInformation { PoolId = PoolId };

job.Commit();        
```

### Create tasks
The app creates a list of [CloudTask](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.cloudtask) objects. Each task processes an input `ResourceFile` object using a [CommandLine](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.cloudtask.commandline) property. In the sample, the command line runs a command to display the input file. This is a simple example for demonstration purposes. When you use Batch, the command line is where you specify your app or script. Batch provides a number of ways to deploy apps and scripts to compute nodes.

Then, the app adds tasks to the job with the [AddTaskAsync](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.joboperations.addtaskasync) method, which queues them to run on the compute nodes. 

```csharp
foreach (ResourceFile inputFile in inputFiles)
    {
    string taskId = "Task" + inputFiles.IndexOf(inputFile);
    string inputfilename = inputFile.FilePath
    string taskCommandLine = String.Format("cmd /c echo Processing file {0} in task {1} & type {0}", inputfilename, taskId);
    
    CloudTask task = new CloudTask(taskId, taskCommandLine);
    task.ResourceFiles = new List<ResourceFile> { inputFile };
        tasks.Add(task);
    }
batchClient.JobOperations.AddTaskAsync(JobId, tasks).Wait();
```
 
### View task output

The app creates a [TaskStateMonitor](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.taskstatemonitor) to monitor the tasks to make sure they complete. Then, the app uses the [CloudTask.ComputeNodeInformation](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.cloudtask.computenodeinformation) property to display the `stdout.txt` and `stderr.txt` files generated by each completed task. When the task runs successfully, the output of the task command is written to stdout.txt, and stderr.txt is an empty file:

```csharp
foreach (CloudTask task in completedtasks)
{
    string nodeId = String.Format(task.ComputeNodeInformation.ComputeNodeId);
    Console.WriteLine("Task " + task.Id);
    Console.WriteLine("Node " + nodeId);
    Console.WriteLine("stdout:" + Environment.NewLine + task.GetNodeFile(Constants.StandardOutFileName).ReadAsString());
    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.WriteLine("stderr:" + Environment.NewLine + task.GetNodeFile(Constants.StandardErrorFileName).ReadAsString());
}
```

## Clean up resources

The app automatically deletes the storage container it creates, and gives you the option to delete the Batch pool and job. When you delete the pool, all task output on the nodes is deleted.

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, Batch account, and storage account. To do so in the Azure portal, select the resource group for the Batch account and click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you ran a basic Azure Batch job to demonstrate key concepts of the Batch service. To learn more about Azure Batch, and walk through a parallel file processing example with ffmpeg, continue to the Batch .NET tutorial.
