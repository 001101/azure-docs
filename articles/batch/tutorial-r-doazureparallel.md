# Run an Azure Batch in parallel

You can run your R workloads at scale on Azure Batch using doAzureParallel, a lightweight R package that allows you to use Azure Batch directly from your R session. This tutorial details how you can deploy and manage your R jobs in Azure Batch directly within RStudio.  
doAzureParallel is built on top of the popular R package, `foreach`*`. At the most basic level, doAzureParallel takes each iteration of the `foreach` loop and submits it as an Azure Batch task.
