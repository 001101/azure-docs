# What is Azure Cost Management?

﻿Azure Cost Management by Cloudyn is a multi-cloud cost management solution that helps you use Azure and other cloud resources. It helps you track cloud usage and expenditures with straightforward reports. And, you use the reports for cost allocation and showback/chargebacks. Cost Management also helps to optimize cloud costs by identifying underutilized resources and show where you can increase resource utilization.

Dashboard reports make it easy to see all your data to view data for all your cloud resources. Using the dashboards, you can easily reach all your custom reports that allow you to drill into data using grouping and filtering and you can configure display formats.

## Monitor usage and spending

Reports help you monitor spending to analyze and track cloud usage, costs, and trends. Using Over Time reports, you can detect anomalies that differ from normal trends. Inefficiencies in your cloud deployment are visible in optimization reports. You can also notice inefficiencies by analyzing costs.

## Manage costs

You can forecast future spending by reviewing historical data and by analyzing your cost over time trends. Cost Management also includes projected cost reports.

You can use the cost allocation feature to analyze your costs based on your tagging policy. Use custom account, resource, and entity tags add additional cost allocation capabilities. Use Category Manager to better organize your tags and achieve additional governance.

Use Cost Allocation for showback/chargeback to show resource utilization and associated costs to influence consumption behaviors or charge tenant customers.

You can assign teams assess to cost management data by using Azure Role-Based Access Control. You also use entity structure, user management, and scheduled reports with recipient lists to give team members access to cost data.

You can create alerts for unusual spending or overspending. Alerts notify stakeholders automatically for spending anomalies and overspending risks using alerts and reports that support alerts based on budget and cost thresholds.

## Improve efficiency

Determine optimal VM usage and identify idle VMs. Using information in Inefficiency reports, you can create a plan to down-size or remove idle VMs.

If you provisioned AWS Reserved Instances, you can improve your reserved instances utilization with Optimization reports where you can view buying recommendations, modify unused reservations, and plan provisioning.
