# Create sections on your invoice to group your charges

You can create a section on an invoice to group and organize charges for a department, development environment, or anyway you like. Then give others permission to create subscriptions for the section. Any Azure usage charges for that subscription then show on the invoice section. View the total charges for the section on your invoice, in the Azure portal, or review them in Azure cost analysis. For more information, see [Understanding invoice sections](billing-understand-mca-roles.md#manage-invoice-sections-for-billing-account).
