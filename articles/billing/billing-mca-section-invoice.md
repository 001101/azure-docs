# Create sections on your invoice to organize your costs

You can create sections on your invoice to group and organize costs by a department, development environment, or anyway you like. Then give others permission to create Azure subscriptions for the section. Any usage charges or purchases for the subscriptions then show on the invoice section. View the total charges for the section on your invoice, in the Azure portal, or review them in Azure cost analysis. For more information, see [Understanding invoice sections](billing-understand-mca-roles.md#manage-invoice-sections-for-billing-account).

2. Search on **Cost Management + Billing**.
