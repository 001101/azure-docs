# Organize the costs for your Microsoft Customer Agreement billing account

Your billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement provides you flexibility to organize your costs based on your needs whether it by department, project, or development environment. 

This article describes how you can use the Azure portal to organize your costs. It applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

## Billing profile and invoice sections

In the billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you use billing profiles and invoice sections to organize your costs.

### Billing profile

A billing profile represents an invoice and the related billing information such as payment methods and billing address. A monthly invoice is generated at the beginning of the month for each billing profile in your account. The invoice contains charges for Azure subscriptions and other purchases such as Azure marketplace and App source products from the previous month.

A billing profile is automatically created for your billing account. You may create additional billing profiles to set up additional monthly invoices for your account. 

> [!NOTE]
    >
    > Creating additional billing profiles is not supported for customers who sign up through Azure.com.

### Invoice sections 

An invoice section represents a grouping of costs in your invoice. An invoice section is automatically created for each billing profile in your account. You may create additional sections to organize the cost in you invoice. 

When an invoice section is created, you give others permission to create Azure subscriptions and buy other products for the section. Charges for these Azure subscriptions and products are displayed under the section on its billing profile's invoice.
