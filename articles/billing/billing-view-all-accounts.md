# Billing accounts and scopes in the Azure portal

A billing account is created when you sign up to use Azure. You use your billing account to manage your invoices, payments, and track costs. You can have access to multiple billing accounts. For example, you might have signed up for Azure for your personal projects. You could also have access through your organization's Enterprise Agreement or Microsoft Customer Agreement. For each of these scenarios, you would have a separate billing account.

Azure portal supports the following type of billing accounts:

- **Microsoft Online Services Program**: A billing account for a Microsoft Online Services Program is created when you sign up for Azure through the Azure website. For example, when you sign up for an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/), [account with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or as a [Visual studio subscriber](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/).

- **Enterprise Agreement**: A billing account for an Enterprise Agreement is created when your organization signs an [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/) to use Azure.

- **Microsoft Customer Agreement**: A billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement is created when your organization works with a Microsoft representative to sign a Microsoft Customer Agreement. Some customers in select regions, who sign up through the Azure website for an [account with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) may have a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement as well. For more information, see [Get started with your billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement](billing-mca-overview.md).

- **Microsoft Partner Agreement**: A billing account for a Microsoft Partner Agreement is created for Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners to manage their customers in the new commerce experience. Partners need to have at least one customer with an [Azure plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/purchase-azure-plan) to manage their billing account in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Get started with your billing account for Microsoft Partner Agreement](mpa-overview.md).

To determine the type of your billing account, see [Check the type of your billing account](#check-the-type-of-your-billing-account).

## Scopes for billing accounts
A scope is a node within a billing account that you use to view and manage billing. It is where you manage billing data, payments, invoices, and conduct general account management.
