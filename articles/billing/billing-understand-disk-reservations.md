# Understand how your reservation discount is applied to Azure Disk

After you purchase Azure disk reserved capacity, the reservation discount is automatically applied to disk resources that match the terms of your reservation. The reservation discount applies to disk capacity only, disk snapshots are charged at pay-as-you-go rates.

For more information about Azure Disk reservation, see [Save costs with Azure Disks Reservation](../virtual-machines/linux/disks-reserved-capacity.md).
For information about Azure Disk reservation pricing, see [Azure Disk pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## How the reservation discount is applied

The Azure disk reservation discount is a "use-it-or-lose-it" discount and is applied to managed disk resources on an hourly basis. If you don't have any managed disk resources that meet the terms of your reservation for a given hour, then you lose a reservation quantity for that hour. You can't carry forward unused reserved hours.
When you delete a resource, the reservation discount automatically applies to another matching resource in the specified scope. If no matching resources are found in the specified scope, then the reserved hours are lost.

## Discount examples

The following examples show how the Azure Disk reservation discount applies, depending on the deployments.
Suppose that you have purchased 100 P30 (1 TiB) of reserved capacity in the in US West 2 region for a 1-year term.
Assume that the cost of this sample reservation is $140,100‬. You can either choose to pay the full amount up front or to pay fixed monthly installments of $11,675‬ per month for the next twelve months.
For these examples, assume that you have signed up for a monthly reservation payment plan. The following scenarios describe what happens if you under-use or overuse your reserved capacity.

## Underusing your capacity

Suppose that in a given hour within the reservation period, you have deployed only 99 P30 Premium SSD Managed Disks of your 100 P30 disk reservation. The remaining 1 P30 is not applied for that hour and does not carry over.

## Overusing your capacity

Suppose that in a given hour within the reservation period, you are using 101 P30 Premium Managed Disks. The reservation discount applies to 100 P30 disks, and the remaining 1 P30 disk is charged at pay-as-you-go rates for that hour. If in the next hour your usage changes to 100 P30 disks, then all usage is covered by the reservation.
