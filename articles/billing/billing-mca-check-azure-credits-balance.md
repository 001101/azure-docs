# Track Azure credit balance for your Billing profile

You can check the Azure credit balance for your Billing profile in the Azure portal. You use credits to pay for products that are covered by the credits.

You are charged when you use products that aren't covered by the credits or your usage exceeds your credit balance. For more information, see [Products that aren't covered by Azure credits.](#products-that-arent-covered-by-azure-credits)

This article applies to Billing accounts for Microsoft customer agreement. [Check if you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement](../../includes/billing-check-mca.md).

## Check credit balance on the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal]( http://portal.azure.com).

2. Select **Cost Management + Billing** from the lower-left side of the portal.

3. Go to the Billing profile. Depending on your access, you may need to select a Billing account and then   **Billing profiles**.

4. Select **Azure credits**.

   | Term               | Definition                           |
   |--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
   | Estimated balance  | Estimated amount of credits you have after considering all billed and pending transactions |
   | Current balance    | Amount of credits as of your last invoice. It doesn't include any pending transactions |
   | Transactions       | All billing transactions that are applied to your Azure credits |

   When your estimated balance drops to 0, you are charged for all your usage, including for products that are covered by credits.

6. Select **Credits list** to view list of credits for the Billing profile. The credits list provides the following information:

## How credits are used in Microsoft Customer Agreement

In Microsoft customer agreement, you use Billing profiles to customize how you pay your invoices. A Billing profile contains information like billing address and payment methods. A monthly invoice is generated for each Billing profile and you use the payment methods to pay the invoice.

Azure credits are one of the payment methods. You add credit or Microsoft provides you credit. You assign the credit to a Billing profile. When an invoice is generated for the Billing profile, credits are automatically applied to the total billed amount to calculate the amount that you need to pay. You pay the remaining amount with another payment method like check or wire transfer.

## Products that aren't covered by Azure credits
