# Manage access to billing information for Azure

For most subscriptions, you can give billing information access to members of your team from **Subscriptions** in the Azure portal. If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer) and are the Enterprise Administrator, you can give permissions to the Department Admins and Account Owners from **Cost Management + Billing** in the Azure portal.

## Give access to billing for most subscriptions

You can grant access for Azure billing information to members of your team by assigning one of the following user roles to your subscription:

- Account Administrator
- Service Administrator
- Co-administrator
- Owner
- Contributor
- Reader
- Billing Reader

Those roles have access to billing information in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). People that are assigned those roles can also use the [Billing APIs](billing-usage-rate-card-overview.md) to programmatically get invoices and usage details. For more information, see [Roles in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

The following sections describe how you can give members of your organization the ability to download invoices or grant read-only access to billing information.

### <a name="opt-in"></a> Allow users to download invoices

To allow members of your team with with the appropriate roles on the subscription to download invoices, the Account Administrator turns on the assess in the Azure portal. Invoices older than December 2016 are available only to the Account Administrator.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. As the Account Administrator, select your subscription from the [Subscriptions blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) in Azure portal.

1. Select **Invoices** and then **Access to invoices**.

1. Select **On** and save.

The Account Administrator can also configure to have invoices sent via email. To learn more, see [Get your invoice in email](billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md).

### Allow read-only access to billing information

Assign the Billing Reader role to someone that needs read-only access to the subscription billing information but not the ability to manage or create Azure services. This role is appropriate for users in an organization who only perform financial and cost management for Azure subscriptions.

If you're an EA customer and the Enterprise Administrator has enabled **Account Owner can view charges** or **Department Admin can view charges**, you can assign the read-only access to billing role.

The Billing Reader feature is in preview, and does not yet support non-global clouds.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) in Azure portal.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)** and then click **Add**.

1. Choose **Billing Reader** as the **Role**.
1. In the **Select** textbox, type the name or email for the user you add.
1. Select **Save**.
1. The Billing Reader receives an email with a link to sign in.

### Only Account Administrators can access the Account Center

The Account Administrator is the legal owner of the subscription. By default, the person who signed up for or bought the Azure subscription is the Account Administrator, unless the [subscription ownership was transferred](billing-subscription-transfer.md) to somebody else. The Account Administrator can create subscriptions, cancel subscriptions, change the billing address for a subscription, and manage access policies for the subscription from the [Account Center](https://account.azure.com/Subscriptions).

## Grant access to billing for EA customers

The Enterprise Admin can allow the Department Admins and Account Owners to view usage details and costs associated to the Departments and Accounts that they manage.

1. As the Enterprise Admin, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search on **Cost Management + Billing**.

    ![Screenshot that shows Azure portal search](./media/billing-manage-access/portal-cm-billing-search.png)
   
1. Select **Billing account** and the account that you want to manage.
1. Select **Policies**.
1. Select **Account owners can view charges** or **Department admins can view charges** or both.
1. After you select these policies, the Department Admin and/or Account Owners can:

   - View the Usage Summary dashboard in the EA portal for their specific department or account.
   - Download reports from **Download Usage** in the EA portal. The reports include the Usage Detail CSV and Marketplace Charges CSV for their specific department or account.
   - Access the enterpriseâ€™s custom pricing in Azure Calculator.
   - See forecasts at EA price rates in the Azure portal.

For more information, see Understand Azure Enterprise Agreement administrative roles.

## Adding users to other roles

Users in other roles, such as Owner or Contributor, can access not just billing information, but Azure services as well. To manage these roles, see [Manage access using RBAC and the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
