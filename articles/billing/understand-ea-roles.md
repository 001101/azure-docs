# Understand Azure Enterprise Agreement administrative roles in Azure

To help manage your organization's usage and spend, Azure customers with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer) have four distinct administrative roles:

- Enterprise Administrator
- Department Administrator
- Account Owner
- Service Administrator
 
Those roles are specific to managing Enterprise Agreements in the Azure portal. Azure has additional built-in roles to control access to resources. For more information, see [Build-in roles for Azure resources](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

The following sections describe the user limits for each role, the tasks the roles have permissions to do, and what portal and pricing tools those roles have access to. For all the tasks, Enterprise Administrators and Department Administrators may be granted read-only access.

## User limit for admin roles

|Role| User limit|
|---|---|
|Enterprise Administrator|Unlimited|
|Department Administrator|Unlimited|
|Account Owner|1 per account<sup>1</sup>|
|Service Administrator|1-199|

<sup>1</sup> Each account requires a unique Microsoft account, or work or school account.
