# Find an Azure subscription or management group

If youâ€™re having trouble finding a subscription or management group in Azure, you might be looking in the wrong directory. This situation could happen when your account exists in multiple Azure Active Directories. Each [active directory is independent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-directory-independence) and access is not inherited across directories.      

## Switch directories 
You can easily switch directories in the Azure portal.
1.	Sign into the Azure portal, 
2.  Select your name in the top right of the screen.  A menu pops up. 
3.	The bottom of the menu lists all the directories you have access to.
4.	Selecting a different directory changes the directory you are signed in

## Asset not found? 
If you are receiving an error message "Asset not found" when trying to access a subscription or management group, then you do not have the correct role to view this item.  See the [Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure) document for help.  

## Improve your experience 
You can transfer your subscriptions or your management groups into the directory you choose so that everything exists in the same place.  Consolidating subscriptions and management groups into the same directory helps reduce the need to switch directories and allow polices to be inherited.  


### Transfer your subscriptions 
 An option is to move the subscriptions that exist within a directory into the directory with the groups.  To do a transfer, you need to perform a Subscription Ownership Transfer.  
* Have an enterprise portal administrator follow the following link to initiate the transfer.  
    * [Transfer ownership of Azure subscription to another account](https://ea.azure.com/helpdocs/changeAccountOwnerForASubscription)

### Transfer your management groups
 The ability to move the groups within and across enrollments is not available within the Azure portal.  As the management group feature is in preview, the transfer feature is coming soon.
