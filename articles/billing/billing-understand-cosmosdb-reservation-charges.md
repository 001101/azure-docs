# Understand how the reservation discount is applied to Azure Cosmos DB

After you buy an Azure Cosmos DB reserved capacity, the reservation discount is automatically applied to Azure Cosmos DB resources that match the attributes and quantity of the reservation. A reservation covers the throughput provisioned for Azure Cosmos DB resources and it doesnâ€™t cover software, networking, storage or pre-defined container charges.

For reserved Virtual Machine Instances see [Understand Azure Reserved VM Instances discount](../billing/billing-understand-vm-reservation-charges.md).

## Reservation discount applied to Azure Cosmos DB accounts

Reservation discount is applied to provisioned throughput (RU/s) on an hour-by-hour basis. For Azure Cosmos DB resources that don't run the full hour, the reservation discount is automatically applied to other Cosmos DB resources that match the reservation attributes. The discount can apply to Azure Cosmos DB resources that are running concurrently. If you don't have Cosmos DB resources that run for the full hour and that match the reservation attributes, you don't get the full benefit of the reservation discount for that hour.

* The discounts are tiered which means reservations with higher request units provide higher discounts.  
* The reservation purchase will apply discounts to all regions in the ratio equivalent to the regional on-demand pricing. For reservation discount ratio in each region see [reservation discount per region](#reservation-discount-per-region) section of this article.

## Reservation discount per region
The reservation discount applies to meter usage in the following ratio:

## Examples

Consider the following requirements for a reservation:

* Required throughput: 50,000 RU/s  
* Regions used: 2, for reservation discount ratio in each region see [reservation discount per region](#reservation-discount-per-region) section of this article.  
* In this case your total on-demand charges are for 500 quantity of 100 RU/s meter  in these 2 regions, for a total RU/s consumption of 100,000 every hour.  

If your deployments were in the following regions, then a reservation purchase of 100,000 RU/s would completely balance your on-demand charges for RU/s. 


|Meter description | Region |Usage (RU/s) |Reservation discount applied to RU/s |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Azure Cosmos DB - 100 RU/s/Hour - US North Central  |   US North Central  | 50,000  | 50,000  |
|Azure Cosmos DB - 100 RU/s/Hour - US West  |  US West   |  50,000  |  50,000 |

If your deployments were in the following regions, then a reservation purchase of 100,000 RU/s would provide discounts as follows (Assuming that AU Central 2 usage was discounted first):


|Meter description | Region |Usage (RU/s) |Reservation discount applied to RU/s |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Azure Cosmos DB - 100 RU/s/Hour - AU Central 2  |  AU Central 2   |  50,000  |  50,000   |
|Azure Cosmos DB - 100 RU/s/Hour - FR South  |  FR South   |  50,000 |  15,384  |

**Logic behind the calculation** 

* Using the ratios in the first table: 50,000 units of usage in AU Central 2 corresponds to 75,000 (Usage * reservation_discount_ratio for that region) that is: 50,000 * 1.5 = 75,000 normalized usage. For reservation discount ratio in each region see [reservation discount per region](#reservation-discount-per-region) section of this article.  

* 100,000 units of normalized reservation purchase would offset the 75,000 usage and the left over 25,000 units will apply discount to up to 25,000 / 1.625  units of usage in FR South. The Azure billing system will assign the Reservation billing benefit to the first instance that is processed which matches the Reservation configuration
