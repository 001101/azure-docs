# View your organization's Azure pricing

Azure customers with an Enterprise Agreement (EA) or [Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-your-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement) may view and download their pricing from the Azure portal. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement, see [View and download pricing for your billing profile](#View-and-download-pricing-for-your-billing-profile).

## View and download EA pricing

Depending on the policies set for your organization by the Enterprise Admin, only certain administrative roles provide access to your organization's EA pricing information. For more information, see [Understand Azure Enterprise Agreement administrative roles in Azure](billing-understand-ea-roles.md).

1. As an Enterprise Admin, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search on **Cost Management + Billing**.
