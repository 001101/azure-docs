# View your Enterprise's Azure pricing

Azure customers with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customers) may view and download the Enterprise's pricing from the Azure Portal. You may also use your Enterprise’s pricing to estimate costs by using the Azure pricing calculator.

Depending on the policies you have set for a billing account, only certain administrative roles can view your enterprise's pricing information. For more information, see Understand Azure Enterprise Agreement administrative roles in Azure.

## View and download your Enterprise’s pricing

 
1. As the Enterprise Admin, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 
1. Search on **Cost Management + Billing**.
