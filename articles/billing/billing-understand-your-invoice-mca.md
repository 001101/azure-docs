# Understand terms on your Microsoft Customer Agreement invoice

This article applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-your-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

The invoice provides a summary of your charges and provides instructions for payment. Itâ€™s available for download in the Portable Document Format (.pdf) from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or can be sent via email. For more information, see [How to get your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data](billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md).

A few things to note:

-   You are invoiced on a monthly basis. You can find out which day of the month you receive invoices by checking *invoice date* under billing profile properties in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Charges that occur between the end of the billing period and the invoice date are included in the next month's invoice, since they are in the next billing period. The billing period start and end dates for each invoice are listed in the invoice PDF above **Billing Summary**.

-   Charges on invoices for international customers are converted to their local currencies. Exchange rate information is shown at the bottom of the invoice.

## Invoice terms and descriptions

The following sections list important terms that you see on your invoice and descriptions for each term.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Charges|Total number of Microsoft charges for this billing profile since the last billing period |

| Estimated total savings |The estimated total amount you saved from effective discounts. If applicable, effective discount rates are listed beneath the purchase line items in Details by Invoice Section. |

### Invoice sections

For each invoice section under your billing profile, you'll see the charges, the amount of Azure credits applied, tax, and the total amount due.

`Total = Charges - Azure Credit + Tax`

### Details by invoice section

The details show the cost for each invoice section broken down by product order name. Within each product order, cost is broken down by service family.

The total amount due for each service family is calculated by subtracting Azure credits from credits/charges and adding tax:

`Total = Charges/Credits - Azure Credit + Tax`
