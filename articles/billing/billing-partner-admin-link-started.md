# Partner Admin Link
Partner Admin Link allows partners who do consulting work or provide managed services on Microsoft Azure to track and report the impact across all customer engagements. This feature uses partner's existing access to customer's Azure resources.  Partner can link their existing access credentials, which are used for managing customer's Azure resources to their Microsoft Partner Network ID. This method doesn't give any new access to partners. 

Partner Admin Link is available in a public preview. 

## How this works? 
Today as a partner, you use following methods to get access for customerâ€™s Azure resources: 

- **Guest User:** The customer can add with guest users from your organization using Azure AD business-to-business (B2B) collaboration capabilities and assign the role to the Azure resources.    See [Add guest users from another directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b) for information.

- **Directory account:**   The customer can create a new user from your organization in their own directory and assign the role to the Azure resources.

- **Service Principal:**  The customer can add an app or script that can manage customer's Azure resources.  The identity of the app or script is known as a service principal. 

Once you have access to customer resources, you can use PowerShell or CLI to link your Microsoft Partner Network ID (MPN ID) to  user ID or Service Principal. 

## PowerShell
