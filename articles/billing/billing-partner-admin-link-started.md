# Link partner ID to your account
Partners who do consulting work or provide managed services on Microsoft Azure can track their impact across all customer engagements by linking the Partner ID to the accounts used for managing customer's resources.

- **Directory account:**  Customer can create a new user from your organization in their directory and assign any RBAC role. 

- **Service Principal:**  The customer can add an app or script from your orgnization in their directory and assign any RBAC role.The identity of the app or script is known as Service Principal.
