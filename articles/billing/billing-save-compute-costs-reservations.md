# What are Azure reserved instances?

Azure reserved instances helps you save money by pre-paying for one-year or three-years of virtual machine or SQL Database compute capacity. Pre-paying allows you to get a discount on the resources you use. Azure reserved instances can significantly reduce your virtual machine or SQL database compute costs—up to 72 percent on pay-as-you-go prices–with one-year or three-year upfront commitment. Reserved instances provide a billing discount and do not affect the runtime state of your virtual machines or SQL databases.

You can buy a reserved instance in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/reservations). For more information, see the following topics:

- [Prepay for Virtual Machines with Azure Reserved VM Instances](../virtual-machines/windows/prepay-reserved-vm-instances.md)
- [Prepay for SQL Database compute resources with SQL reserved vCores](../sql-database/sql-database-reserved-vcores.md).

## Why should I buy a reserved instance?

If you have virtual machines or SQL databases that run for long periods of time, purchasing a reserved instance gives you the most cost-effective option. For example, if you continuously run four instances of a service without a reserved instance, you are charged at pay-as-you-go rates. If you purchase a reserved instance for those resources, you immediately get the reserved instance discount. The resources are no longer charged at the pay-as-you-go rates.

## What charges does a reserved instance cover?

- Reserved Virtual Machine Instance: A reserved instance only covers the virtual machine compute costs. A reserved instance does not cover additional software, networking, or storage charges.
- SQL Database reserved vCore: Only the compute costs are included with a reserved instance. The license is billed separately.

For Windows virtual machines and SQL Database, you can cover the licensing costs with [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/).

A SQL Reserved Instance covers the infrastructure charges for your SQL database.

## Who’s eligible to purchase a reserved instance?

Azure customers with these subscriptions types can purchase a reserved instance:

- Enterprise agreement subscription offer type (MS-AZR-0017P).
- [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) subscription offer type (MS-AZR-003P). You must have the “Owner” role on the subscription to buy a reserved instance. To purchase reserved instances in an enterprise enrollment, the enterprise administrator must enable reserved instance purchases in the EA portal. By default, this setting is enabled.
- Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners can use Azure portal or [Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-reservations) to purchase reserved instances.

## How is a reserved instance purchase billed?

The reserved instance purchase is charged to the payment method tied to the subscription. If you have an Enterprise subscription, the reserved instance cost is deducted from your monetary commitment balance. If your monetary commitment balance doesn’t cover the cost of the reserved instance, you’re billed the overage. If you have a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, the credit card you have on your account is billed immediately. If you’re billed by invoice, you see the charges on your next invoice.

## How is the purchased reserved instance discount applied?

The reserved instance discount applies to the resource usage that matches the attributes you select when you purchase the reserved instance. The attributes include the scope where the matching VMs, SQL databases, or other resources run. For example, if you want a reserved instance discount for four Standard D2 virtual machines in the West US region, select the subscription where the VMs are running. If the virtual machines are running in different subscriptions within your enrollment/account, then select the scope as shared. Shared scope allows the reserved instance discount to be applied across subscriptions. You can change the scope after you buy a reserved instance. For more information, see [Manage reserved instances in Azure](billing-manage-reserved-vm-instance.md).

The reserved instance discount only applies to virtual machines or SQL databases associated with enterprise or Pay-As-You-Go subscription types. Virtual machines or SQL databases that run in a subscription with other offer types do not receive the reserved instance discount. For enterprise enrollments, enterprise Dev/Test subscriptions aren’t eligible for the reserved instance benefits.

To better understand how reserved instance affects your virtual machine or SQL database billing, see [Understand how the reserved instance discount is applied](billing-understand-vm-reservation-charges.md).

## What happens when the reserved instance term expires?

At the end of the reserved instance term, the billing discount expires, and the virtual machine, SQL database, or other resources are billed at the pay-as-you go price. Azure reserved instances do not auto-renew. To continue getting the billing discount, you must buy a new reserved instance for reservation eligible services.

## Next steps

Start saving on your virtual machines by purchasing a [Reserved VM Instance](../virtual-machines/windows/prepay-reserved-vm-instances.md) or [SQL Database reserved vCore](../sql-database/sql-database-reserved-vcores.md).
