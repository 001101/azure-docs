# Download or view your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data

For most subscriptions, you can download your invoice from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) or have it sent in email. If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer), you can't download your organization's invoices. Invoices are sent to whoever is set up to receive invoices for the enrollment.

If you're an EA customer or have a [Microsoft Customer Agreement](billing-mca-overview.md#check-your-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement), you can download usage in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). For other subscriptions, go to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.azure.com/Subscriptions) to download usage.

Only certain roles have permission to get billing invoice and usage information, like the Account Administrator, or Enterprise Administrator. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you must be an Owner, Contributor, or Invoice manager of a billing profile to view its invoices. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](billing-manage-access.md).

### <a name="noinvoice"></a> If you don't see an invoice for the last billing period

There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:

- It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure.

- The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.

- You don't have permission to view invoices. For MCA billing accounts, you must be the Owner, Contributor, or Invoice manager of the billing profile. For other subscriptions, you might not see old invoices if you aren't the Account Administrator.

- If you don't have an Microsoft Customer Agreement, you won't get an invoice if you have a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed or if you have a Free Trial.

## Download usage

 For most subscriptions, find your  daily usage file in the [Azure Account Center](https://account.azure.com/Subscriptions). If you're an EA customer or have a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you can download usage in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
