# Complete common Enterprise Agreement tasks in your billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement

If your organization has signed a Microsoft Customer Agreement to renew your Enterprise Agreement enrollment, then you must set up the new billing account created for the agreement. Your new billing account provides you enhanced billing and cost management capabilities through a new streamlined, unified management experience. For more information, see [Set up your billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement](billing-mca-setup-account.md)

This article describes how to use your new billing account to complete tasks that you performed in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment.

## Mapping of Enterprise Agreement's billing to the new billing account

The billing in your new account is organized differently than your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. The following table explains the mapping of billing from your Enterprise Agreement enrollment to your new billing account.

| Enterprise Agreement   | Microsoft Customer Agreement    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Enrollment            | You use a billing profile to manage billing for your organization, similar to your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. Enterprise administrators become owners of the billing profile. To learn more about billing profiles, see [Understand billing profiles](billing-mca-overview.md#understand-billing-profiles).
| Department            | You use an invoice section to organize your costs based on your needs, similar to departments in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. Department becomes invoice sections and department administrators become owners of the respective invoice sections. To learn more about invoice sections, see [Understand invoice sections](billing-mca-overview.md#understand-invoice-sections). |
| Account               | The accounts that were created in your Enterprise Agreement arenâ€™t supported in the new billing account. The account's subscriptions belong to the respective invoice section for their department. Account owners can create and manage subscriptions for their invoice sections. |

## Tasks performed by an enterprise administrator

If you are an enterprise administrator on an Enterprise Agreement that got renewed to a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you are assigned the following roles on the new billing account created for the agreement:

**Billing profile owner** - You are assigned this role on the billing profile that was created when the agreement was signed. The role lets you manage the billing for your organization. You can view charges and invoices, organize costs on the invoice, manage payment methods, and control access to your organization's billing.

**Invoice section owner** - You are assigned this role on all invoice sections that are created for the departments in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. The role lets you view and track charges, and control who can create Azure subscriptions and purchase other products.

### View charges and credits balance for your organization

You use your billing profile to track charges and Azure credits balance for your organization similar to your Enterprise Agreement enrollment.
