# Install the Durable Functions extension and samples (Azure Functions)

The [Durable Functions](durable-functions-overview.md) extension for Azure Functions is provided in the NuGet package [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask). This article shows how to install the package and a set of samples for the following development environments:

* Visual Studio 2017 (Recommended) 

* Azure portal

## Visual Studio 2017

Visual Studio currently provides the best experience for developing apps that use Durable Functions.  Your functions can be run locally and can also be published to Azure. You can start with an empty project or with a set of sample functions.

### Prerequisites

* Install the [latest version of Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) (version 15.3 or greater). Include the Azure tools in your setup options.

### Start with sample functions

1. Download the [Sample App .zip file for Visual Studio](https://azure.github.io/azure-functions-durable-extension/files/VSDFSampleApp.zip). You don't need to add the NuGet reference because the sample project already has it.
2. Install and run [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator) version 5.2 or later. Alternatively, you can update the *local.appsettings.json* file with real Azure Storage connection strings.
3. Open the project in Visual Studio 2017. 
4. For instructions on how to run the sample, start with [Function chaining - Hello sequence sample](durable-functions-sequence.md). The sample can be run locally or published to Azure.

### Start with an empty project
 
Follow the same directions as for starting with the sample, but do the following steps instead of downloading the *.zip* file:

1. Create a Function App project.
2. Add the following NuGet package reference to your *.csproj* file:

   ```xml
   <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask" Version="1.0.0-beta" />
   ```
   
## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code provides local development experience covering all major platforms - Windows, Mac and Linux.  Your functions can be run locally and can also be published to Azure. You can start with an empty project or with a set of sample functions.

### Prerequisites

* Install the [latest version of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) 

* Follow the instructions under "Install the Azure Functions Core Tools" at [Code and test Azure Functions locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you already have the Azure Functions Cross Platform Tools, please be sure to update them to the latest available version.

* On Windows install [Azure Storage Emulator](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=717179&clcid=0x409) and for Mac create storage account on Azure 


### Start with sample functions

1. Clone the [Durable Functions repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension.git)
2. Navigate on your machine to the [samples folder](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/csx) 
3. Install Azure Durable Extension by running in command prompt / terminal the following command :

```javascript
https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/csx/E1_HelloSequence   func extensions install -p Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask -v 1.0.0-beta
```
4. Run Azure Storage Emulator on Windows and on Mac update the *local.appsettings.json* file with real Azure Storage connection string
3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code 
5. For instructions on how to run the sample, start with [Function chaining - Hello sequence sample](durable-functions-sequence.md). The sample can be run locally or published to Azure
6. Start the project by running in command prompt / terminal the following command:
```javascript
   func host start
```

### Start with an empty project
 
1. In Command Prompt/Terminal navigate to folder that will host your function app
2. Install Azure Durable Extension by running in command prompt / terminal the following command :

```javascript
   func extensions install -p Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask -v 1.0.0-beta
```
3. Run Azure Storage Emulator on Windows and on Mac update the *local.appsettings.json* file with real Azure Storage connection string
4. Create a Function App project by running the following command:

```javascript
   func init
```
5. Next, create new Function by running the following command and follow the wizard steps:

```javascript
   func new
```
>[!IMPORTANT]
> Currently Durable Function template is not available but you can start with one of the supported options and then modify the code. Please use for reference the samples we have for [Orchestration Client](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/csx/HttpStart), [Orchestration Trigger](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/csx/E1_HelloSequence) and [Activity Trigger](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/csx/E1_HelloSequence)

6. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code and continue for modify the template code 
7. Start the project by running in command prompt / terminal the following command:
```javascript
   func host start
```

## Azure portal

If you prefer, you can use the Azure portal for Durable Functions development.

### Create an orchestrator function

1. Create a new function app at [functions.azure.com](https://functions.azure.com/signin).
2. Configure the function app to [use the 2.0 runtime version](functions-versions.md).
3. Create a new function, and select the **Durable Functions Orchestrator - C#** template.
4. Under **Extensions not installed**, click **Install** to download the extension from NuGet.org.

### Copy sample code to the function app

1. Download the [DFSampleApp.zip](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/raw/master/docfx/files/DFSampleApp.zip) file.
2. Unzip the sample file into `D:\home\site\wwwroot` in the function app, using Kudu or FTP.
