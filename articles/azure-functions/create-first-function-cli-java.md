# Quickstart: Create a function in Azure that responds to HTTP requests

In this article, you use command-line tools to create a Java function that responds to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless environment of Azure Functions. 

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

## Create a local function project

In Azure Functions, a function project is a container for one or more individual functions that each responds to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same local and hosting configurations. In this section, you create a function project that contains a single function.

In an empty folder, run the following command to generate the Functions project from a [Maven archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html). Use `-DjavaVersion=11` if you want to deploy a Java 11 functions.To learn more, see [Java versions](functions-reference-java.md#java-versions). 

# [bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure -DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype -DjavaVersion=8
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
mvn archetype:generate "-DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure" "-DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype" "-DjavaVersion=8" 
```

# [Cmd](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
mvn archetype:generate "-DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure" "-DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype" "-DjavaVersion=8"
```

Maven asks you for values needed to finish generating the project on deployment.   
Provide the following values when prompted:

| Prompt | Value | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| **groupId** | `com.fabrikam` | A value that uniquely identifies your project across all projects, following the [package naming rules](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se6/html/packages.html#7.7) for Java. |
| **artifactId** | `fabrikam-functions` | A value that is the name of the jar, without a version number. |
| **version** | `1.0-SNAPSHOT` | Choose the default value. |
| **package** | `com.fabrikam` | A value that is the Java package for the generated function code. Use the default. |

Type `Y` or press Enter to confirm.

Maven creates the project files in a new folder with a name of _artifactId_, which in this example is `fabrikam-functions`. 

Navigate into the project folder:

```console
cd fabrikam-functions
```

This folder contains various files for the project, including configurations files named [local.settings.json](functions-run-local.md#local-settings-file) and [host.json](functions-host-json.md). Because *local.settings.json* can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the *.gitignore* file.

[!INCLUDE [functions-cli-add-function](../../includes/functions-cli-add-function.md)]

### (Optional) Examine the file contents

If desired, you can skip to [Run the function locally](#run-the-function-locally) and examine the file contents later.

#### Function.java
*Function.java* contains a `run` method that receives request data in the `request` variable is an [HttpRequestMessage](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.httprequestmessage) that's decorated with the [HttpTrigger](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.httptrigger) annotation, which defines the trigger behavior. 

:::code language="java" source="~/azure-functions-samples-java/src/main/java/com/functions/Function.java":::

The response message is generated by the [HttpResponseMessage.Builder](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.httpresponsemessage.builder) API.

#### pom.xml

Settings for the Azure resources created to host your app are defined in the **configuration** element of the plugin with a **groupId** of `com.microsoft.azure` in the generated pom.xml file. For example, the configuration element below instructs a Maven-based deployment to create a function app in the `java-functions-group` resource group in the `westus` region. The function app itself runs on Windows hosted in the `java-functions-app-service-plan` plan, which by default is a serverless Consumption plan.    

:::code language="java" source="~/azure-functions-samples-java/pom.xml" range="62-102":::

You can change these settings to control how resources are created in Azure, such as by changing `runtime.os` from `windows` to `linux` before initial deployment. For a complete list of settings supported by the Maven plug-in, see the [configuration details](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Functions:-Configuration-Details).

If you want to run your function app on Java 11 instead of Java 8, you must manually update the pom.xml file with Java 11 values. To learn more, see [Java versions](functions-reference-java.md#java-versions). When running on Java 11, make sure that  

#### FunctionTest.java

The archetype also generates a unit test for your function. When you change your function to add bindings or add new functions to the project, you'll also need to modify the tests in the *FunctionTest.java* file.

[!INCLUDE [functions-run-function-test-local-cli](../../includes/functions-run-function-test-local-cli.md)]

## Deploy the function project to Azure

A function app and related resources are created in Azure when you first deploy your functions project. Settings for the Azure resources created to host your app are defined in the [pom.xml file](#pomxml). In this article, you'll accept the defaults.

> [!TIP]
> To create a function app running on Linux instead of Windows, change the `runtime.os` element in the pom.xml file from `windows` to `linux`. Running Linux in a consumption plan is supported in [these regions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Linux-Consumption-Regions). You can't have apps that run on Linux and apps that run on Windows in the same resource group.

Before you can deploy, use the [az login](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) Azure CLI command to sign in to your Azure subscription. 

```azurecli
az login
```

Use the following command to deploy your project to a new function app.

```console
mvn azure-functions:deploy
```

This creates the following resources in Azure:

+ Resource group. Named as _java-functions-group_.
+ Storage account. Required by Functions. The name is generated randomly based on Storage account name requirements.
+ Hosting plan. Serverless hosting for your function app in the _westus_ region. The name is _java-functions-app-service-plan_.
+ Function app. A function app is the deployment and execution unit for your functions. The name is randomly generated based on your _artifactId_, appended with a randomly generated number.

The deployment packages the project files and deploys them to the new function app using [zip deployment](functions-deployment-technologies.md#zip-deploy). The code runs from the deployment package in Azure.

## Invoke the function on Azure

Because your function uses an HTTP trigger, you invoke it by making an HTTP request to its URL in the browser or with a tool like curl. In both instances, the `code` URL parameter is your unique [function key](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys) that authorizes the invocation of your function endpoint.

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

Copy the complete **Invoke URL** shown in the output of the publish command into a browser address bar, appending the query parameter `&name=Functions`. The browser should display similar output as when you ran the function locally.

![The output of the function run on Azure in a browser](./media/functions-create-first-azure-function-azure-cli/function-test-cloud-browser.png)

# [curl](#tab/curl)

Run [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) with the **Invoke URL**, appending the parameter `&name=Functions`. The output of the command should be the text, "Hello Functions."

> [!TIP]
> To view near real-time logs for a published function app, use the [Application Insights Live Metrics Stream](functions-monitoring.md#streaming-logs).
>
> Run the following command to open the live metrics stream in a browser.
>
>   ```console
>   func azure functionapp logstream <APP_NAME> --browser
>   ```

## Clean up resources

If you continue to the next step, [Add an Azure Storage queue output binding](functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-cli.md), keep all your resources in place as you'll build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources to avoid incurring further costs.

```azurecli
az group delete --name java-functions-group
```
