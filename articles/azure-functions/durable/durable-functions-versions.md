# Durable Functions versions overview

*Durable Functions* is an extension of [Azure Functions](../functions-overview.md) and [Azure WebJobs](../../app-service/web-sites-create-web-jobs.md) that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless environment. The extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you. If you are not already familiar with Durable Functions, see the [overview documentation](durable-functions-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Durable Functions 1.x is generally available (GA). Durable Functions 2.0 is currently in public preview.

## New features in 2.0

### Durable entities

In Durable Functions 2.0, we introduced a new [entity functions](durable-functions-entities.md) concept.

Entity functions define operations for reading and updating small pieces of state, known as *durable entities*. Like orchestrator functions, entity functions are functions with a special trigger type, *entity trigger*. Unlike orchestrator functions, entity functions do not have any specific code constraints. Entity functions also manage state explicitly rather than implicitly representing state via control flow.

To learn more, see the [durable entities](durable-functions-entities.md) article.

### Durable HTTP

In Durable Functions 2.0, we introduced a new [Durable HTTP](durable-functions-http-features.md#consuming-http-apis) feature that allows you to:

* Call HTTP APIs directly from orchestration functions (with some documented limitations)
* Implement automatic client-side HTTP 202 status polling
* Built-in support for [Azure Managed Identities](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md)

To learn more, see the [HTTP features](durable-functions-http-features.md#consuming-http-apis) article.

## Migrate from 1.x to 2.x

### Durable Functions extension

Install the version of the [Durable Functions bindings extension](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask) that matches the version you want to use. See [Register Azure Functions binding extensions](../functions-bindings-register.md) for more information.

### Update your code

Durable Functions 2.x introduces several breaking changes.

>[!NOTE]  
>Durable Functions 1.x applications are not compatible with Durable Functions 2.x without code changes. 

This section lists some of the changes you must make when upgrading your version 1.x functions to 2.x.

#### Host.json schema

Durable Functions 2.x uses a new host.json schema. The main changes from 1.x include:

* `"storageProvider"` (and the `"azureStorage"` subsection) for storage-specific configuration.
* `"tracking"` for tracking and logging configuration.
* `"notifications"` (and the `"eventGrid"` subsection) for event grid notification configuration.

See the [Durable Functions bindings documentation](durable-functions-bindings.md#durable-functions-2-0-host-json) for details.

#### Public interface changes (.NET only)

In version 1.x, the various _context_ objects supported by Durable Functions have abstract base classes intended for use in unit testing. As part of Durable Functions 2.x, these abstract base classes are replaced with interfaces. Function code that uses the concrete types directly don't need to be updated.

The following table represents the main changes:

| Old type | New type |
|----------|----------|
| `DurableOrchestrationClientBase` | `IDurableOrchestrationClient` |
| `DurableOrchestrationContextBase` | `IDurableOrchestrationContext` |
| `DurableActivityContextBase` | `IDurableActivityContext` |
| `OrchestrationClientAttribute` | `DurableClientAttribute` |

In the case where an abstract base class contained virtual methods, these virtual methods have been replaced by extension methods defined in `DurableContextExtensions`.
