# What is Durable Functions?

*Durable Functions* is an extension of [Azure Functions](../functions-overview.md) that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless environment. The extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you. 

The extension lets you define stateful workflows using an [*orchestrator function*](durable-functions-types-features-overview.md#orchestrator-functions), which can provide the following benefits:

* You can define your workflows in code. No JSON schemas or designers are needed.
* Other functions can be called both synchronously and asynchronously. Output from called functions can be saved to local variables.
* Progress is automatically checkpointed when the function awaits. Local state is never lost when the process recycles or the VM reboots.

The primary use case for Durable Functions is simplifying complex, stateful coordination requirements in serverless applications. The following are some typical application patterns that can benefit from Durable Functions:

* [Chaining](durable-functions-concepts.md#chaining)
* [Fan-out/fan-in](durable-functions-concepts.md#fan-in-out)
* [Async HTTP APIs](durable-functions-concepts.md#async-http)
* [Monitoring](durable-functions-concepts.md#monitoring)
* [Human interaction](durable-functions-concepts.md#human)

Durable Functions currently supports function development in both C# and JavaScript. Like Azure Functions, there are templates to help you develop Durable Functions using [Visual Studio 2017](durable-functions-create-first-csharp.md), [Visual Studio Code](quickstart-js-vscode.md), and the [Azure portal](durable-functions-create-portal.md).

Because Durable Functions is an advanced extension for [Azure Functions](../functions-overview.md), it isn't appropriate for all applications. To learn more about Durable Functions, see [Durable Functions patterns and technical concepts](durable-functions-concepts.md). For a comparison with other Azure orchestration technologies, see [Compare Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps](../functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs.md#compare-azure-functions-and-azure-logic-apps).

Durable Functions are billed the same as Azure Functions. For more information, see [Azure Functions pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/).
