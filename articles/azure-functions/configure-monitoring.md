# How to configure monitoring for Azure Functions

Azure Functions integrates with Application Insights to better enable you to monitor your function apps. Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor, is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service that collects data generated by your function app, including information your app writes to logs. Application Insights integration is typically enabled when your function app is created. 

You can use Application Insights without any custom configuration. The default configuration can result in high volumes of data. If you're using a Visual Studio Azure subscription, you might hit your data cap for Application Insights. Later in this article, you learn how to configure and customize the data that your functions send to Application Insights. For a function app, logging is configured in the [host.json] file.
 
This article shows you how to perform the following tasks:

+ [Configure categories](#configure-categories)
+ [Configure log levels](#configure-log-levels)
+ Configure the aggregator
+ Configure sampling
+ Enable Application Insights integration
+ Disable Application Insights integration

## Configure categories

The Azure Functions logger includes a *category* for every log. The category indicates which part of the runtime code or your function code wrote the log. The following chart describes the main categories of logs that the runtime creates. 

| Category | Description |
| ----- | ----- | 
| Host.Results | These logs show as **requests** in Application Insights. They indicate success or failure of a function. All of these logs are written at `Information` level. If you filter at `Warning` or above, you won't see any of this data. |
| Host.Aggregator | These logs provide counts and averages of function invocations over a [configurable](#configure-the-aggregator) period of time. The default period is 30 seconds or 1,000 results, whichever comes first. The logs are available in the **customMetrics** table in Application Insights. Examples are the number of runs, success rate, and duration. All of these logs are written at `Information` level. If you filter at `Warning` or above, you won't see any of this data. |

All logs for categories other than these are available in the **traces** table in Application Insights.

All logs with categories that begin with `Host` are written by the Functions runtime. The **Function started** and **Function completed** logs have category `Host.Executor`. For successful runs, these logs are `Information` level. Exceptions are logged at `Error` level. The runtime also creates `Warning` level logs, for example: queue messages sent to the poison queue.

The Functions runtime creates logs with a category that begin with "Host." In version 1.x, the `function started`, `function executed`, and `function completed` logs have the category `Host.Executor`. Starting in version 2.x, these logs have the category `Function.<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>`.

If you write logs in your function code, the category is `Function.<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>.User` and can be any log level. In version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the category is `Function`.

## Configure log levels

The Azure Functions logger also includes a *log level* with every log. `LogLevel` is an enumeration, where the integer code value indicates relative importance:

|LogLevel    |Code| Description |
|------------|---|--------------|
|Trace       | 0 |Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data. These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment.|
|Debug       | 1 | Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development. These logs should primarily contain information useful for debugging and have no long-term value. |
|Information | 2 | Logs that track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value. |
|Warning     | 3 | Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but do not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. |
|Error       | 4 | Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. |
|Critical    | 5 | Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. |
|None        | 6 | Not used for writing log messages. Specifies that a logging category should not write any messages. |

The [host.json] file configuration determines how much logging a function app sends to Application Insights. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can use specially configured application settings to represent specific settings in a host.json file for a specific environment. This lets you effectively change host.json settings without having to republish the host.json file in your project. To learn more, see [Override host.json values](functions-host-json.md#override-hostjson-values).

For each category, you indicate the minimum log level to send. The host.json settings vary depending on the [Functions runtime version](functions-versions.md). 

The example below defines logging based on the following rules:

* For logs of `Host.Results` or `Function`, send only `Error` level and above to Application Insights. Logs for `Warning` level and below are ignored.
* For logs of `Host.Aggregator`, send all logs to Application Insights. The `Trace` log level is the same as what some loggers call `Verbose`, but use `Trace` in the [host.json] file.
* For all other logs, send only `Information` level and above to Application Insights.

The `logLevel` values (`categoryLevels` in v1.x) in [host.json] control logging for all categories that begin with the same value. `Host` in [host.json] controls logging for `Host.General`, `Host.Executor`, `Host.Results`, and so on.

# [v2.x+](#tab/v2)

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "fileLoggingMode": "always",
    "logLevel": {
      "default": "Information",
      "Host.Results": "Error",
      "Function": "Error",
      "Host.Aggregator": "Trace"
    }
  }
}
```

# [v1.x](#tab/v1) 

```json
{
  "logger": {
    "categoryFilter": {
      "defaultLevel": "Information",
      "categoryLevels": {
        "Host.Results": "Error",
        "Function": "Error",
        "Host.Aggregator": "Trace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

If [host.json] includes multiple logs that start with the same string, the more defined logs ones are matched first. Consider the following example that logs everything in the runtime (`Host`) at `Error` level, except for `Host.Aggregator`, which is logged at the `Information` level:

# [v2.x+](#tab/v2)

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "fileLoggingMode": "always",
    "logLevel": {
      "default": "Information",
      "Host": "Error",
      "Function": "Error",
      "Host.Aggregator": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

# [v1.x](#tab/v1) 

```json
{
  "logger": {
    "categoryFilter": {
      "defaultLevel": "Information",
      "categoryLevels": {
        "Host": "Error",
        "Function": "Error",
        "Host.Aggregator": "Information"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

To suppress all logs for a category, you can use log level `None`. At this level, no logs are written with that category and there's no log level above it.

## Configure the aggregator

As noted in the previous section, the runtime aggregates data about function executions over a period of time. The default period is 30 seconds or 1,000 runs, whichever comes first. You can configure this setting in the [host.json] file.  Here's an example:

```json
{
    "aggregator": {
      "batchSize": 1000,
      "flushTimeout": "00:00:30"
    }
}
```

## Configure sampling

Application Insights has a [sampling](../azure-monitor/app/sampling.md) feature that can protect you from producing too much telemetry data on completed executions at times of peak load. When the rate of incoming executions exceeds a specified threshold, Application Insights starts to randomly ignore some of the incoming executions. The default setting for maximum number of executions per second is 20 (five in version 1.x). You can configure sampling in [host.json](./functions-host-json.md#applicationinsights).  Here's an example:

# [v2.x+](#tab/v2)

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "maxTelemetryItemsPerSecond" : 20,
        "excludedTypes": "Request"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# [v1.x](#tab/v1)  

```json
{
  "applicationInsights": {
    "sampling": {
      "isEnabled": true,
      "maxTelemetryItemsPerSecond" : 5
    }
  }
}
```

---

In version 2.x, you can exclude certain types of telemetry from sampling. In the previous v2.x+ example, data of type `Request` is excluded from sampling. This makes sure that *all* function executions (requests) are logged while other types of telemetry remain subject to sampling.

## Enable Application Insights integration

For a function app to send data to Application Insights, it needs to know the instrumentation key of an Application Insights resource. The key must be in an app setting named **APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY**.

When you create your function app [in the Azure portal](functions-create-first-azure-function.md), from the command line by using [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-create-first-azure-function-azure-cli.md), or by using [Visual Studio Code](functions-create-first-function-vs-code.md), Application Insights integration is enabled by default. The Application Insights resource has the same name as your function app, and it's created either in the same region or in the nearest region.

### New function app in the portal

To review the Application Insights resource being created, select it to expand the **Application Insights** window. You can change the **New resource name** or choose a different **Location** in an [Azure geography](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/) where you want to store your data.

![Enable Application Insights while creating a function app](media/functions-monitoring/enable-ai-new-function-app.png)

When you choose **Create**, an Application Insights resource is created with your function app, which has the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` set in application settings. Everything is ready to go.

### Add to an existing function app 

When you create a function app using [Visual Studio](functions-create-your-first-function-visual-studio.md), you must create the Application Insights resource. You can then add the instrumentation key from that resource as an [application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) in your function app.

[!INCLUDE [functions-connect-new-app-insights.md](../../includes/functions-connect-new-app-insights.md)]

Early versions of Functions used built-in monitoring, which is no longer recommended. When enabling Application Insights integration for such a function app, you must also [disable built-in logging](#disable-built-in-logging).  

## Disable built-in logging

When you enable Application Insights, disable the built-in logging that uses Azure Storage. The built-in logging is useful for testing with light workloads, but isn't intended for high-load production use. For production monitoring, we recommend Application Insights. If built-in logging is used in production, the logging record might be incomplete because of throttling on Azure Storage.

To disable built-in logging, delete the `AzureWebJobsDashboard` app setting. For information about how to delete app settings in the Azure portal, see the **Application settings** section of [How to manage a function app](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings). Before you delete the app setting, make sure no existing functions in the same function app use the setting for Azure Storage triggers or bindings.
