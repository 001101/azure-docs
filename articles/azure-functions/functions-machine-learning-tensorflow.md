# Tutorial: Make machine learning predictions with TensorFlow and Azure Functions

In this tutorial, you'll learn how Azure Functions allows you to import a machine learning model and use it with TensorFlow to make predictions.

By the end of tutorial, you'll be able to: 

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Initialize a local environment for developing Azure Functions in Python
> * Import a custom TensorFlow machine learning model into a function app
> * Build a serverless HTTP API for predicting whether a photo contains a dog or a cat
> * Consume the API from a web application

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites 

To create Azure Functions in Python, you need to install a few tools.

- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
- A code editor

You may use any editor of your choice. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) extensions.

## Clone the tutorial repository

To begin, open a terminal and clone the following repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial.git
cd functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial
```

The repository contains a few folders.

- *start*:  This is your working folder for the tutorial
- *end*: This is the final result and full implementation for your reference
- *resources*: Contains the machine learning model and helper libraries
- *frontend*: A website that calls the function app

## Create and activate a Python virtual environment

Azure Functions requires Python 3.6.x. Consider creating a virtual environment to ensure you're using the required Python version.

Change the current working directory to the *start* folder and create a virtual environment named *.venv*. Replace `<PYTHON_PATH>` with the path to Python 3.6.x on your machine.

```bash
cd start
<PYTHON_PATH> -m venv .venv
```

Next, activate the virtual environment.

*Linux and macOS*

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

*Windows*

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

The terminal prompt is now prefixed with `(.venv)` which indicates you have successfully activated the virtual environment. Confirm that `python` in the virtual environment is indeed Python 3.6.x.

```bash
python --version
```

> [!NOTE]
> For the remainder of the tutorial, you run commands in the virtual environment. If you need to reactivate the virtual environment in a terminal, execute the appropriate activate command for your operating system.

## Create an Azure Functions project

Use the Azure Functions Core Tools to initialize a Python function app in the folder.

```bash
func init --worker-runtime python
```

A function app can contain one or more Azure Functions. Open the *start* folder in an editor and examine the contents.

- *local.settings.json*: Contains application settings used for local development
- *host.json*: Contains settings for the Azure Functions host and extensions
- *requirements.txt*: Contains Python packages required by this application

## Create an HTTP function

The application requires a single HTTP API endpoint that takes an image URL as the input and returns a prediction of whether the image contains a dog or a cat.

In the terminal, use the Azure Functions Core Tools to scaffold a new HTTP function named *classify*.

```bash
func new --language python --template HttpTrigger --name classify
```

A new folder named *classify* is created, containing two files.

- *\_\_init\_\_.py*: A file for the main function
- *function.json*:  A file describing the function's trigger and its input and output bindings

### Change the function authentication level

By default, the function is configured with an authentication level of `function` that requires an authentication code to be included in every HTTP request. To allow anonymous requests, open *function.json* and change the `authLevel` of the HTTP trigger to `anonymous`.

```json
{
    "authLevel": "anonymous",
    "type": "httpTrigger",
    "direction": "in",
    "name": "req",
    "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
    ]
}
```

### Test the function

In the terminal with the Python virtual environment activated, start the function app.

```bash
func start
```

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/classify?name=Azure`. The function should return *Hello Azure!*

Use `Ctrl-C` to stop the function app.

## Import the TensorFlow model

You'll use a pre-built TensorFlow model that was trained with and exported from Azure Custom Vision Service. If you want to build your own using Custom Vision Service's free tier, you can follow the [instructions in the repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/blob/master/train-custom-vision-model.md).

The model consists of two files in the *<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/resources/model* folder: *model.db* and *labels.txt*. Copy them into the *classify* function's folder.

*Linux and macOS*

```bash
cp ../resources/model/* classify
```

*Windows*

```powershell
copy ..\resources\model\* classify
```

## Add the helper functions and dependencies

Some helper functions for preparing the input image and making a prediction using TensorFlow are in a file named *predict.py* in the *resources* folder. Copy this file into the *classify* function's folder.

*Linux and macOS*

```bash
cp ../resources/predict.py classify
```

*Windows*

```powershell
copy ..\resources\predict.py classify
```

### Install dependencies

The helper library has some dependencies that need to be installed. In the terminal with the virtual environment activated, run the following commands in the function app folder that contains *requirements.txt*.

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install Pillow
pip install requests
```

Save the dependencies in *requirements.txt*.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Caching the model in global variables

In the editor, open *predict.py* and look at the `_initialize` function near the top of the file. Notice that the TensorFlow model is loaded from disk the first time the function is executed and saved to global variables. The loading from disk is skipped in subsequent executions of the `_initialize` function. Caching the model in memory with this technique speeds up later predictions.

## Update function to run predictions

Open *classify/\_\_init\_\_.py* in your editor. Import the *predict* library that you added to the same folder earlier. Add the following `import` statements below the other imports already in the file.

```python
import json
from .predict import predict_image_from_url
```

Replace the function body with the following.

```python
def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    image_url = req.params.get('img')
    results = predict_image_from_url(image_url)

    headers = {
        "Content-type": "application/json",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
    }
    return func.HttpResponse(json.dumps(results), headers = headers)
```

This function receives an image URL in a query string parameter named `img`. It calls `predict_image_from_url` from the helper library that downloads the image and returns a prediction using the TensorFlow model. The function then returns an HTTP response with the results.

Since the HTTP endpoint is called by a web page hosted on another domain, the HTTP response includes an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to satisfy the browser's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> In a production application, consider changing `*` to the web page's specific origin for added security.

### Run the function app

Ensure the Python virtual environment is still activated and start the function app using the following command.

```bash
func start
```

In a browser, open this URL that calls your function with a photo of a cat. Confirm that a valid prediction result is returned.

```
http://localhost:7071/api/classify?img=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/raw/master/resources/assets/samples/image1.jpg
```

Keep the function app running.

### Run the web app

There's a simple web app in the *frontend* folder that consumes the HTTP API in the function app.

Open a *separate* terminal and change to the *frontend* folder. Start an HTTP server with your Python 3.6 executable.

```bash
cd <FRONT_END_FOLDER>
<PYTHON_PATH> -m http.server
```

In a browser, navigate to the HTTP server's URL. A web app should appear. Find a public URL of a dog or cat photo and enter it into the textbox. When you click submit, the function app is called and a prediction is returned and displayed on the page.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to build and customize an HTTP API with Azure Functions to make predictions using a TensorFlow model. You also learned how to call the API from a web application.

You can use the techniques in this tutorial to build out APIs of any complexity, all while running on the serverless compute model provided by Azure Functions.

To deploy the function app to Azure, use the [Azure Functions Core Tools](./functions-run-local.md#publish) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-azure-functions).
