# Shifting from Express.js to Azure Functions

Express.js is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks for web developers and remains an excellent choice for apps not build with serverless architecture.

When migrating code to a serverless architecture, refactoring Express.js endpoints affects the following areas:

- **Middleware**: Express.js features a robust collection of middleware. Some middleware modules are no longer required when moving to Azure Functions. Ensure you can replicate or replace any logic handled by essential middleware before migrating endpoints.

- **Differing APIs**: The API used to process both requests and responses differs among Azure Functions and Express.js. The following example details the required changes.

- **Default route**: By default, Azure Functions endpoints are exposed under the `api` route. Routing rules are configurable.

- **Configuration and conventions**: There are a few configuration and conventions you need to consider as you move to Azure Functions. A Functions app uses the _function.json_ file to define HTTP verbs, define security policies, and can configure the function's [input and output](./azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings.md). Also, by convention, the folder name, which contains the function files defines the endpoint name.

## Example

### Express.js

The following example shows a typical Express.js `GET` endpoint.

```javascript
// server.js
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  try {
    res.send("Success!");
  } catch(error) {
    const err = JSON.stringify(error);
    res.status(500).send(`Request error. ${err}`);
  }
});
```

When a `GET` request is sent `/hello`, then an `HTTP 200` response containing "Success" is returned. If the endpoint returns an error, the response is an `HTTP 500` with the error details.

### Azure Functions

The following example implements the same result as the Express.js endpoint, but with Azure Functions.

```javascript
// hello/index.js
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  try {
    context.res = { body: "Success!" };
  } catch(error) {
    const err = JSON.stringify(error);
    context.res = {
      status: 500,
      body: `Request error. ${err}`
    };
  }
  context.done();
};
```

When moving to Functions, the following changes are made:

- **Module:** The function code is implemented as a JavaScript module that requires you to provide a value for `module.exports`.

- **Context  and response object**: The `context` object holds the `res` object, which allows you to define a response. To complete the function call, you need to call `context.done()`.

- **Naming convention**: The folder name used to contain the Azure Functions files is used as the endpoint name.

- **Configuration**: Rather than defining the HTTP verb in code, the *function.json* file defines allowed HTTP verbs.

The following _function.json_ file holds configuration information for the function.

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": ["get"]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ]
}
```

By defining `get` in the `methods` array, the function is available to HTTP `GET` requests.
