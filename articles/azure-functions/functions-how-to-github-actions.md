# Continuous delivery by using GitHub Action

You can automatically deploy your function to an Azure Functions app by using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). As GitHub Actions still in a closed beta, you'll need to sign up [here](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Create a Workflow

For a Workflow to be executed, you need a `{whatever name you like}.yml` file under the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repo, this file contains the different steps and parameters for that workflow. For Azure Functions, we separate that file in three sections: authentication, build section, and deploy section.

### Authentication

To give the workflow the ability to deploy to your function app, you will need to set up two things: 1- A service principal 2- A secret under your GitHub repo called **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**

**Setting up a service principal**

You can do that by executing the following [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/), this can be done from the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<APP_NAME> --sdk-auth
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is always a good practice to grant minimum access, in this case only for the site not the whole resource group.

**Setting up a GitHub secret**

Using the output of the Azure CLI command, browse your repo webpage.

Click on Secrets

Add the **AZURE_CREDENTIALS** secret with the value from the output from the Azure CLI command

### Build

To build you functionapp, you'll need to: 1- setup the environment, 2- build your app

**Setting up** 

Setting up the environment can be done using one of the publish setup actions.

|Language | Setup Action |
|---------|---------|
|.Net     | actions/setup-dotnet |
|NodeJS     | actions/setup-node |
|Python   | actions/setup-python |
|Java    | actions/setup-java |

A snippet from the yaml file for a Node JS app that uses version 10

```yaml
    - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
          uses: Azure/actions/login@master
          with:
            creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        - name: Setup Node 10.x
          uses: actions/setup-node@v1
          with:
            node-version: '10.x'
```

**Build the app**

This depends on the language and for languages supported by Azure Functions, this section should be the standard build steps of each language.
As an example for Node JS

A snippet from the yaml file for a Node JS app

```yaml
    - name: 'Run npm'
          shell: bash
          run: |
            # If your function app project is not located in your repository's root
            # Please change your directory for npm in pushd
            pushd .
            npm install
            npm run build --if-present
            npm run test --if-present
            popd
```

### Deploy

To deploy your code to a function app, you will need to use the `Azure/functions-action` action, there are two parameters that this action uses:


|Parameter |Explanation  |
|---------|---------|
|app-name | mandatory: that's the name of the azure function app |
|slot-name | optional: that's the name of the slot you want to deploy to, it should already be created under `app-name` |

The following snippet show how to use version 1 of the action

```yaml
    - name: 'Run Azure Functions Action'
          uses: Azure/functions-action@v1
          id: fa
          with:
            app-name: PLEASE_REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_NAME
```

There are a number of samples available under the [Azure GitHub Actions workflow samples repo](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples), you can use these samples a starting point for your workflow.
