#Introduction to workload management

Workload management is the management of system resources to enable prioritization, performance, and predictability of queries in a database system. Workload management controls among other things, the amount of memory each query receives, concurrency, and prioritization of queries. To ensure predictable performance at scale, SQL Data Warehouse allows you to control resource allocations such as memory and CPU prioritization. SQL Data Warehouse workload management is intended to help you support multi-user environments. It is not intended for multi-tenant workloads.

## Workload management in SQL Data Warehouse

Workload management in SQL Data Warehouse is governed by the use of resource classes, concurrency slots, and workload groups. 

*Resource classes* assign a set amount of system resources such as memory to users. 

*Concurrency slots* represent the reservation of total concurrency a particular query will have based on its resource class. 

*Workload groups* assigns *importance* to various resource classes which manages the systems priority in granting resources.

Users should focus on workload management to:

- Ensure queries are prioritized according to business need
- Ensure predictable query performance
- Maximize the number of queries that are handled by the system concurrently
- Maximize query performance
- Optimize index quality
- Prevent system bottlenecks

## Concurrency

SQL Data Warehouse allows up to 1,024 concurrent connections. All 1,024 connections can submit queries concurrently. However, to optimize throughput, SQL Data Warehouse may queue some queries to ensure that each query receives a minimal memory grant. **Queuing occurs at query execution time**. By queuing queries when concurrency limits are reached, SQL Data Warehouse can increase total throughput by ensuring that active queries get access to critically needed memory resources.  

Concurrency limits are governed by two concepts: *concurrent queries* and *concurrency slots*. For a query to execute, it must execute within both the query concurrency limit and the concurrency slot allocation.

- Concurrent queries are the queries executing at the same time. SQL Data Warehouse supports up to 32 concurrent queries on the larger DWU sizes.
- Concurrency slots are allocated based on DWU. Each 100 DWU provides 4 concurrency slots. For example, a DW100 allocates 4 concurrency slots and DW1000 allocates 40. Each query consumes one or more concurrency slots, dependent on the [resource class](#resource-classes) of the query. 

When concurrency limits are met, new queries are queued and executed on a first-in, first-out basis.  As a queries finishes and the number of queries and slots falls below the limits, queued queries are released. 

> [!NOTE]  
> *Select* queries executing exclusively on dynamic management views (DMVs) or catalog views are not governed by any of the concurrency limits. You can monitor the system regardless of the number of queries executing on it.

## Resource class overview

Resource classes help you control memory allocation and CPU cycles given to a query. Resource classes are assigned to individual users. Therefore, each query statement submitted by the user in turn receives all of the resources granted to it by its resource class assignment. The amount of resources granted to a all users' queries in turn dictates the number of queries that may run concurrently. 

### Resource class types

#### Static Resource Classes

Static resource classes (**staticrc10, staticrc20, staticrc30, staticrc40, staticrc50, staticrc60, staticrc70, staticrc80**) allocate the same amount of memory regardless of the current DWU provided that the current DWU has enough memory. This means that on larger DWUs, you can run more queries in each resource class concurrently. **We recommend users to select static resource class assignments for most resource class assignments.**

#### Dynamic Resource Classes

Dynamic resource classes (**smallrc, mediumrc, largerc, xlargerc**) allocate a variable amount of memory depending on the current DWU. This means that when you scale up to a larger DWU, your queries automatically get more memory. 

### Memory allocation

Different resource classes offer benefits and drawbacks for users' queries. A larger resource class gives a user's queries access to more memory, which may mean queries execute faster.  However, higher resource classes also reduce the number of concurrent queries that can run. **This is the trade-off between allocating large amounts of memory to a single query or allowing other queries, which also need memory allocations, to run concurrently**. If one user is given high allocations of memory for a query, other users will not have access to that same memory to run a query.

Users in **smallrc** and **staticrc10** are given a smaller amount of memory and can take advantage of higher concurrency. In contrast, users assigned to **xlargerc** or **staticrc80** are given large amounts of memory, and therefore fewer of their queries can run
concurrently.

For memory mappings of resource classes, visit [memory allocation mappings](workload management mappings).

### Query importance

SQL Data Warehouse implements resource classes by using workload groups. There are a total of eight workload groups that control the behavior of the resource classes across the various DWU sizes. Workload groups control the *importance* of query which affects the priority of resource allocation to queries.. Importance is used for CPU scheduling. Queries run with high importance will get three times more CPU cycles than those with medium importance. Therefore, concurrency slot mappings also determine CPU priority. When a query consumes 16 or more slots, it runs as high importance. By extension, the resource class is mapped directly to the assignment of *importance* to a query.

For workload group assignments to resource classes, visit [workload group mappings]().

### Details on resource class assignment

A few more details on resource class:

- *Alter role* permission is required to change the resource class of a user.
- Although you can add a user to one or more of the higher resource classes, dynamic resource classes take precedence over static resource classes. That is, if a user is assigned to both **mediumrc**(dynamic) and **staticrc80**(static), **mediumrc** is the resource class that is honored.
- When a user is assigned to more than one resource class in a specific resource class type (more than one dynamic resource class or more than one static resource class), the highest resource class is honored. That is, if a user is assigned to both mediumrc and largerc, the higher resource class (largerc) is honored. And if a user is assigned to both **staticrc20** and **statirc80**, **staticrc80** is honored.
- The resource class of the system administrative user **cannot** be changed.

## Queries that honor concurrency limits

Most queries are governed by resource classes. These queries must fit inside both the concurrent query and concurrency slot thresholds. A user cannot choose to exclude a query from the concurrency slot model.

To reiterate, the following statements honor resource classes:

- INSERT-SELECT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- SELECT (when querying user tables)
- ALTER INDEX REBUILD
- ALTER INDEX REORGANIZE
- ALTER TABLE REBUILD
- CREATE INDEX
- CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
- CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS)
- Data loading
- Data movement operations conducted by the Data Movement Service (DMS)

## Query exceptions to concurrency limits

Some queries do not honor the resource class to which the user is assigned. These exceptions to the concurrency limits are made when the memory resources needed for a particular command are low, often because the command is a metadata operation. The goal of these exceptions is to avoid larger memory allocations for queries that will never need them. In these cases, the default small resource class (smallrc) is always used regardless of the actual resource class assigned to the user. For example, `CREATE LOGIN` will always run in smallrc. The resources required to fulfill this operation are very low, so it does not make sense to include the query in the concurrency slot model.  These queries are also not limited by the 32 user concurrency limit, an unlimited number of these queries can run up to the session limit of 1,024 sessions.

The following statements do not honor resource classes:

- CREATE or DROP TABLE
- ALTER TABLE ... SWITCH, SPLIT, or MERGE PARTITION
- ALTER INDEX DISABLE
- DROP INDEX
- CREATE, UPDATE, or DROP STATISTICS
- TRUNCATE TABLE
- ALTER AUTHORIZATION
- CREATE LOGIN
- CREATE, ALTER or DROP USER
- CREATE, ALTER or DROP PROCEDURE
- CREATE or DROP VIEW
- INSERT VALUES
- SELECT from system views and DMVs
- EXPLAIN
- DBCC

## Selecting proper resource class

A good practice is to permanently assign users to a resource class rather than changing their resource classes. For example, loads to clustered columnstore tables create higher-quality indexes when allocated more memory. To ensure that loads have access to higher memory, create a user specifically for loading data and permanently assign this user to a higher resource class.
There are a couple of best practices to follow here. As mentioned above, SQL DW supports two kinds of resource class types: static resource classes and dynamic resource classes.

### Resource classes and loading

1. If the expectations are loads with regular amount of data, a static resource class is a good choice. Later, when scaling up to get more computational power, the data warehouse will be able to run more concurrent queries out-of-the-box, as the load user does not consume more memory.
2. If the expectations are bigger loads in some occasions, a dynamic resource class is a good choice. Later, when scaling up to get more computational power, the load user will get more memory out-of-the-box, hence allowing the load to perform faster.

The memory needed to process loads efficiently depends on the nature of the table loaded and the amount of data processed. For instance, loading data into CCI tables requires some memory to let CCI rowgroups reach optimality. For more details, see the Columnstore indexes - data loading guidance.

As a best practice, we advise you to use at least 200MB of memory for loads.

### Resource classes and querying

Queries have different requirements depending on their complexity. Increasing memory per query or increasing the concurrency are both valid ways to augment overall throughput depending on the query needs.

1. If the expectations are regular, complex queries (for instance, to generate daily and weekly reports) and do not need to take advantage of concurrency, a dynamic resource class is a good choice. If the system has more data to process, scaling up the data warehouse will therefore automatically provide more memory to the user running the query.
2. If the expectations are variable or diurnal concurrency patterns (for instance if the database is queried through a web UI broadly accessible), a static resource class is a good choice. Later, when scaling up to data warehouse, the user associated with the static resource class will automatically be able to run more concurrent queries.

Selecting proper memory grant depending on the need of your query is non-trivial, as it depends on many factors, such as the amount of data queried, the nature of the table schemas, and various join, selection, and group predicates. From a general standpoint, allocating more memory will allow queries to complete faster, but would reduce the overall concurrency. If concurrency is not an issue, over-allocating memory does not harm. To fine-tune throughput, trying various flavors of resource classes may be required.

### Identifying proper resource classes

You can use the following stored procedure to figure out concurrency and memory grant per resource class at a given SLO and the closest best resource class for memory intensive CCI operations on non-partitioned CCI table at a given resource class.

This stored procedure will:

1. To help user figure out concurrency and memory grant per resource class at a given SLO. User needs to provide NULL for both schema and table name for this as shown in the example below.  
2. To help user figure out the closest best resource class for the memory intensed CCI operations (load, copy table, rebuild index, etc.) on non partitioned CCI table at a given resource class. The stored proc uses table schema to find out the required memory grant for this.

#### Dependencies & Restrictions

- This stored proc is not designed to calculate memory requirement for partitioned-cci table.    
- This stored proc doesn't take memory requirement into account for the SELECT part of CTAS/INSERT-SELECT and assumes it to be a simple SELECT.
- This stored proc uses a temp table so this can be used in the session where this stored proc was created.    
- This stored proc depends on the current offerings (e.g. hardware configuration, DMS config) and if any of that changes then this stored proc would not work correctly.  
- This stored proc depends on existing offered concurrency limit and if that changes then this stored proc would not work correctly.  
- This stored proc depends on existing resource class offerings and if that changes then this stored proc wuold not work correctly.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are not getting output after executing stored procedure with parameters provided then there could be two cases. <br />1. Either DW Parameter contains invalid SLO value <br />2. OR there are no matching resource class for CCI operation if table name was provided. <br />For example, at DW100, highest memory grant available is 400MB and if table schema is wide enough to cross the requirement of 400MB.

#### Usage example

Syntax:  
`EXEC dbo.prc_workload_management_by_DWU @DWU VARCHAR(7), @SCHEMA_NAME VARCHAR(128), @TABLE_NAME VARCHAR(128)`  

1. @DWU: Either provide a NULL parameter to extract the current DWU from the DW DB or provide any supported DWU in the form of 'DW100'
2. @SCHEMA_NAME: Provide a schema name of the table
3. @TABLE_NAME: Provide a table name of the interest

Examples executing this stored proc:  

```sql  
EXEC dbo.prc_workload_management_by_DWU 'DW2000', 'dbo', 'Table1';  
EXEC dbo.prc_workload_management_by_DWU NULL, 'dbo', 'Table1';  
EXEC dbo.prc_workload_management_by_DWU 'DW6000', NULL, NULL;  
EXEC dbo.prc_workload_management_by_DWU NULL, NULL, NULL;  
```

Table1 used in the above examples could be created as below:  
`CREATE TABLE Table1 (a int, b varchar(50), c decimal (18,10), d char(10), e varbinary(15), f float, g datetime, h date);`

### Detecting queued queries and other DMVs

You can use the `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests` DMV to identify queries that are waiting in a concurrency queue. Queries waiting for a concurrency slot will have a status of **suspended**.

```sql
SELECT      r.[request_id]                 AS Request_ID
        ,r.[status]                 AS Request_Status
        ,r.[submit_time]             AS Request_SubmitTime
        ,r.[start_time]                 AS Request_StartTime
        ,DATEDIFF(ms,[submit_time],[start_time]) AS Request_InitiateDuration_ms
        ,r.resource_class                         AS Request_resource_class
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r;
```

Workload management roles can be viewed with `sys.database_principals`.

```sql
SELECT  ro.[name]           AS [db_role_name]
FROM    sys.database_principals ro
WHERE   ro.[type_desc]      = 'DATABASE_ROLE'
AND     ro.[is_fixed_role]  = 0;
```

The following query shows which role each user is assigned to.

```sql
SELECT     r.name AS role_principal_name
        ,m.name AS member_principal_name
FROM    sys.database_role_members rm
JOIN    sys.database_principals AS r            ON rm.role_principal_id        = r.principal_id
JOIN    sys.database_principals AS m            ON rm.member_principal_id    = m.principal_id
WHERE    r.name IN ('mediumrc','largerc', 'xlargerc');
```

SQL Data Warehouse has the following wait types:

- **LocalQueriesConcurrencyResourceType**: Queries that sit outside of the concurrency slot framework. DMV queries and system functions such as `SELECT @@VERSION` are examples of local queries.
- **UserConcurrencyResourceType**: Queries that sit inside the concurrency slot framework. Queries against end-user tables represent examples that would use this resource type.
- **DmsConcurrencyResourceType**: Waits resulting from data movement operations.
- **BackupConcurrencyResourceType**: This wait indicates that a database is being backed up. The maximum value for this resource type is 1. If multiple backups have been requested at the same time, the others will queue.

The `sys.dm_pdw_waits` DMV can be used to see which resources a request is waiting for.

```sql
SELECT  w.[wait_id]
,       w.[session_id]
,       w.[type]            AS Wait_type
,       w.[object_type]
,       w.[object_name]
,       w.[request_id]
,       w.[request_time]
,       w.[acquire_time]
,       w.[state]
,       w.[priority]
,    SESSION_ID()            AS Current_session
,    s.[status]            AS Session_status
,    s.[login_name]
,    s.[query_count]
,    s.[client_id]
,    s.[sql_spid]
,    r.[command]            AS Request_command
,    r.[label]
,    r.[status]            AS Request_status
,    r.[submit_time]
,    r.[start_time]
,    r.[end_compile_time]
,    r.[end_time]
,    DATEDIFF(ms,r.[submit_time],r.[start_time])        AS Request_queue_time_ms
,    DATEDIFF(ms,r.[start_time],r.[end_compile_time])    AS Request_compile_time_ms
,    DATEDIFF(ms,r.[end_compile_time],r.[end_time])        AS Request_execution_time_ms
,    r.[total_elapsed_time]
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_waits w
JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions s  ON w.[session_id] = s.[session_id]
JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r  ON w.[request_id] = r.[request_id]
WHERE    w.[session_id] <> SESSION_ID();
```

The `sys.dm_pdw_resource_waits` DMV shows only the resource waits consumed by a given query. Resource wait time only measures the time waiting for resources to be provided, as opposed to signal wait time, which is the time it takes for the underlying SQL servers to schedule the query onto the CPU.

```sql
SELECT  [session_id]
,       [type]
,       [object_type]
,       [object_name]
,       [request_id]
,       [request_time]
,       [acquire_time]
,       DATEDIFF(ms,[request_time],[acquire_time])  AS acquire_duration_ms
,       [concurrency_slots_used]                    AS concurrency_slots_reserved
,       [resource_class]
,       [wait_id]                                   AS queue_position
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_resource_waits
WHERE    [session_id] <> SESSION_ID();
```

The `sys.dm_pdw_wait_stats` DMV can be used for historic trend analysis of waits.

```sql
SELECT    w.[pdw_node_id]
,        w.[wait_name]
,        w.[max_wait_time]
,        w.[request_count]
,        w.[signal_time]
,        w.[completed_count]
,        w.[wait_time]
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_wait_stats w;
```
