# Release Notes May 2018
The following new features, enhancements, and changes have been introduced this month.

## Gen 2 Instances

## GDPR Compliance
## ALTER VIEW
[ALTER VIEW](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-view-transact-sql) allows a user to modify a previously created view withouth having to DELETE/CREATE the view and reapply permissions. 

### Examples
The following example modifies a previously created view.
```sql
ALTER VIEW test_view AS SELECT 1 [data];
```

## CONCAT_WS
[The CONCAT_WS()](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/concat-ws-transact-sql) function resturns a string resulting from the concatenation of two or more values in an end-to-end manner. It separates the concatenated values with the delimiter specified in the first argument. The `CONCAT_WS` function is useful for generating Comma Separated Value (CSV) output.

### Examples
The following example shows concatenating a set of int values with a comma.
```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(',', 1, 2, 3);
```
The following example shows concatenating a set of mixed data type values with a comma.
```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(',', 1, 2, 'String', GETDATE())
```

## Rejected Row Support

## SP_DATATYPE_INFO
The [sp_datatype_info](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-datatype-info-transact-sql) system stored procedure returns information about the data types supported by the current environment. It is commonly used by tools connecting through ODBC connections for data type investigation.

### Examples
The following example retrieves details for all data types supported by SQL Data Warehouse.

```sql
EXEC sp_datatype_info
```

# Behavior Changes
## SELECT INTO with ORDER BY
SQL Data Warehouse will now block `SELECT INTO` queries that contain an `ORDER BY` clause. Previously, this operation would succeed by first ordering the data in memory and then inserting into the target table reordering the data to match the table shape.

### Previous Behavior
The following statement would succeed with additional processing overhead.
```sql
SELECT * INTO table2 FROM table1 ORDER BY 1;
```

### Current Behavior
The following statement will throw an error indicating the `ORDER BY` clause is not supported in a `SELECT INTO` statement.
```sql
SELECT * INTO table2 FROM table1 ORDER BY 1;
```
The error statement returned:
```
Msg 104381, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
The ORDER BY clause is invalid in views, CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, INSERT SELECT, SELECT INTO, inline functions, derived tables, subqueries, and common table expressions, unless TOP or FOR XML is also specified.
```

## SET PARSEONLY ON query status
Using the `SET PARSEONLY ON` syntax allows a user to have the SQL Data Warehouse engine examine the syntax of each T-SQL statement and return any error messages without compiling or executing the statement. Previously, in the [sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-pdw-exec-requests-transact-sql) system view, the status for these statements would remain in the `Running` state. The `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests` view will now return the status as `Complete`.
