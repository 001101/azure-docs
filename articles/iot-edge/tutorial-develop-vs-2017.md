# Tutorial: Develop an IoT Edge module in Visual Studio 2017

In the quickstart articles, you created an IoT Edge device and deployed a pre-built module from the Azure Marketplace. This tutorial walks through what it takes to develop and deploy your own code to an IoT Edge device. This tutorial is a useful prerequisite for all the other tutorials, which will go into more detail about specific programming languages or Azure services. 

This tutorial uses the example of deploying a **C module to a Linux device**. This example was chosen because it has the fewest prerequisites, so that you can learn about the development tools without worrying about whether you have the right libraries installed. Once you understand the development concepts, then you can choose your preferred language or Azure service to dive into the details. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up your development machine.
> * Use the IoT Edge tools for Visual Studio Code to create a new project.
> * Build your project as a container and store it in an Azure container registry.
> * Deploy your code to an IoT Edge device.

## Choose your scenario 

IoT Edge has created development tools for both Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2017. Each tool supports different scenarios, so we have tutorials to help you get started with either. Before you begin this tutorial, make sure that you're using the right tool for your goals. 

If you don't have a specific scenario in mind, or an existing tools preference, but are just interested in learning about IoT Edge, then we recommend that you develop with Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is easy to get started with, and has a wide variety of supported scenarios for IoT Edge. 

Use **Visual Studio 2017** if you...
* Want to develop using C or C#
* Are developing primarily for Windows IoT devices (although you can develop for Linux devices, too)
* Are developing for AMD64 devices
* Or, see [Azure IoT Edge Tools for Visual Studio 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsc-iot.vsiotedgetools) for the full list of supported features

Use **Visual Studio Code** if you...
* Want to develop in Java, Node.js, or Python (although you can use C or C#, too)
* Want to develop solutions with services like Azure Functions, Azure Machine Learning, or Azure Stream Analytics
* Are developing primarily for Linux IoT devices (although you can develop for Windows devices, too)
* Are developing for either AMD64 or ARM32 devices
* Or, see [Azure IoT Edge for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-edge) for the full list of supported features

This tutorial teaches the development steps for Visual Studio 2017. If you would rather use Visual Studio Code, switch to [Develop an IoT Edge module in Visual Studio Code](tutorial-develop-vs-code.md)

## Prerequisites

A development machine:

* You can use your own computer or a virtual machine, depending on your development preferences.
* Most operating systems that can run a container engine can be used for IoT Edge development. This tutorial uses a Windows computer, but points out known differences on MacOS or Linux. 

An Azure IoT Edge device:

* We recommend that you don't run IoT Edge on your development machine, but instead use a separate device. This distinction between development machine and IoT Edge device more accurately mirrors a true deployment scenario, and helps to keep the different concepts straight.
* If you don't have a second device available, use the quickstart article to create an IoT Edge device in Azure with a [Linux virtual machine](quickstart-linux.md). This tutorial uses a Linux IoT Edge device, but points out differences for Windows devices. 

Cloud resources:

* Along with your working IoT Edge device, you should also have a free or standard-tier [IoT hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in Azure. 

## Key concepts

This tutorial walks through the development of an IoT Edge module. An *IoT Edge module*, or sometimes just *module* for short, is a container that contains executable code. You can deploy one or more modules to an IoT Edge device. Modules perform specific tasks like ingesting data from sensors, performing data analytics or data cleaning operations, or sending messages to an IoT hub. For more information, see [Understand Azure IoT Edge modules](iot-edge-modules.md).

When developing IoT Edge modules, it's important to understand the difference between the development machine and the target IoT Edge device where the module will eventually be deployed. The container that you build to hold your module code must match the operating system (OS) of the target device. For example, the most common scenario is someone developing a module on a Windows computer intending to target a Linux IoT Edge device. In that case, the container operating system would be Linux. This tutorial demonstrates that scenario and tries to explicitly call out when a step applies to the *development machine OS* or the *container OS*.

## Install container engine

IoT Edge modules are packaged as containers, so you need a container engine on your development machine to build and manage the containers. We recommend using Docker Desktop for development because of its many features and popularity as a container engine. With Docker Desktop on a Windows device, you can switch between Linux containers and Windows containers so that you can easily develop modules for different types of IoT Edge devices. 

Use the Docker documentation to install on your development machine: 

* [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

  * When you install Docker Desktop for Windows, you're asked whether you want to use Linux or Windows containers. This decision can be changed at any time using an easy switch. For this tutorial, we assume Linux containers. For more information, see [Switch between Windows and Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).

* [Install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

* Read [About Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for installation information on several Linux platforms

## Install VS Code and tools

If you're familiar with container development, you can use your preferred editors and tools to develop IoT Edge modules. If not, we recommend using the IoT extensions for Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2017 that were built specifically to assist with IoT Edge development. These extensions provide project templates, automate the creation of the deployment manifest, and allow you to monitor and manage IoT Edge devices. 

Visual Studio 2017 currently supports the following development options:
* Languages: C and C#
* Device architecture: AMD64

Visual Studio Code currently supports the following development options:
* Languages: C, C#, Java, Node.js, and Python
* Device architecture: AMD64, ARM32v7
* Cloud services: Azure Functions (C#), Azure Machine Learning, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Marketplace

## Create a container registry

In this tutorial, you use the Azure IoT Tools for Visual Studio Code to build a module and create a **container image** from the files. Then you push this image to a **registry** that stores and manages your images. Finally, you deploy your image from your registry to run on your IoT Edge device.

You can use any Docker-compatible registry to hold your container images. Two popular Docker registry services are [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) and [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#viewing-repository-tags). This tutorial uses Azure Container Registry.

If you don't already have a container registry, follow these steps to create a new one in Azure:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create a resource** > **Containers** > **Container Registry**.

2. Provide the following values to create your container registry:

   | Field | Value |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | Registry name | Provide a unique name. |
   | Subscription | Select a subscription from the drop-down list. |
   | Resource group | We recommend that you use the same resource group for all of the test resources that you create during the IoT Edge quickstarts and tutorials. For example, **IoTEdgeResources**. |
   | Location | Choose a location close to you. |
   | Admin user | Set to **Enable**. |
   | SKU | Select **Basic**. |

5. Select **Create**.

6. After your container registry is created, browse to it, and then select **Access keys**.

7. Copy the values for **Login server**, **Username**, and **Password** and save them somewhere convenient. You use these values throughout this tutorial to provide access to the container registry.

   ![Copy login server, username, and password for container registry](./media/tutorial-develop-vs-code/registry-access-key.png)

## Create a new module project

The Azure IoT Tools extension provides project templates for all supported IoT Edge module languages in Visual Studio Code. These templates have all the files and code that you need to deploy a working module to test IoT Edge, or give you a starting point to customize the template with your own business logic. 

## Build and push your solution

You've reviewed the module code and the deployment template to understand some key deployment concepts. Now, you're ready to build the SampleModule container image and push it to your container registry. With the IoT tools extension for Visual Studio Code, this step also generates the deployment manifest based on the information in the template file and the module information from the solution files. 

## Deploy solution to a device

You verified that the built container images are stored in your container registry, so it's time to deploy them to a device. Make sure that your IoT Edge device is up and running. 

## View messages from device

The SampleModule code receives messages through its input queue and passes them along through its output queue. The deployment manifest declared routes that passed messages to SampleModule from tempSensor, and then forwarded messages from SampleModule to IoT Hub. The Azure IoT tools for Visual Studio Code allow you to see messages as they arrive at IoT Hub from your individual devices. 

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you set up Visual Studio 2017 on your development machine and deployed your first IoT Edge module from it. Now that you know the basic concepts, try adding functionality to a module so that it can analyze the data passing through it. Choose your preferred language:
