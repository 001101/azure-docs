# Develop and deploy a Python IoT Edge module to your simulated device - preview

You can use IoT Edge modules to deploy code that implements your business logic directly to your IoT Edge devices. This tutorial walks you through creating and deploying an IoT Edge module that filters sensor data. You'll use the simulated IoT Edge device that you created in the Deploy Azure IoT Edge on a simulated device in [Windows][lnk-tutorial1-win] or [Linux][lnk-tutorial1-lin] tutorials. In this tutorial, you learn how to:    

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use Visual Studio Code to create an IoT Edge Python module
> * Use Visual Studio Code and Docker to create a docker image and publish it to your registry 
> * Deploy the module to your IoT Edge device
> * View generated data


The IoT Edge module that you create in this tutorial filters the temperature data generated by your device. It only sends messages upstream if the temperature is above a specified threshold. This type of analysis at the edge is useful for reducing the amount of data communicated to and stored in the cloud. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently the Python module can only be run in amd64 Linux containers; it cannot run in Windows containers or ARM-based containers. 

## Prerequisites

* The Azure IoT Edge device that you created in the quickstart or first tutorial.
* The primary key connection string for the IoT Edge device.  
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
* [Azure IoT Edge extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-edge). 
* [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). 
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on the same computer that has Visual Studio Code. The Community Edition (CE) is sufficient for this tutorial. 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installation) for installing Python packages (typically included with your Python installation).

## Create a container registry
In this tutorial, you use the Azure IoT Edge extension for VS Code to build a module and create a **container image** from the files. Then you push this image to a **registry** that stores and manages your images. Finally, you deploy your image from your registry to run on your IoT Edge device.  

You can use any Docker-compatible registry for this tutorial. Two popular Docker registry services available in the cloud are [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) and [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#viewing-repository-tags). This tutorial uses Azure Container Registry. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create a resource** > **Containers** > **Azure Container Registry**.
2. Give your registry a name, choose a subscription, choose a resource group, and set the SKU to **Basic**. 
3. Select **Create**.
4. Once your container registry is created, navigate to it and select **Access keys**. 
5. Toggle **Admin user** to **Enable**.
6. Copy the values for **Login server**, **Username**, and **Password**. You'll use these values later in the tutorial. 

## Create an IoT Edge module project
The following steps show you how to create an IoT Edge Python module using Visual Studio Code and the Azure IoT Edge extension.
1. In Visual Studio Code, select **View** > **Integrated Terminal** to open the VS Code integrated terminal.
2. In the integrated terminal, enter the following command to install (or update) **cookiecutter** (we suggest doing this either into a virtual environment or as a user install as shown below):

    ```cmd/sh
    pip install --upgrade --user cookiecutter
    ```

3. In VS Code command palette, type and run the command **Azure IoT Edge: New IoT Edge solution**. Then select your workspace folder, provide the solution name (The default name is **EdgeSolution**), and create a Python Module (**FilterModule**) as the first user module in this solution. You also need to specify the Docker image repository for your first module. The default image repository is based on a local Docker registry (`localhost:5000/filtermodule`). You need to replace the `localhost:5000` with the **Login server** (the registry address) of the Azure Container Registry you created.
 
4. The VS Code window will load your IoT Edge solution workspace. There is a **modules** folder, a **.vscode** folder and a deployment manifest template file in the workspace folder. Browse to the **FilterModule**  folder in the **modules** folder, and click **main.py** to open it.

5. At the top of the **FilterModule** namespace, import the `json` library:

    ```python
    import json
    ```

6. Add the `TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD`, `RECEIVE_CALLBACKS`, and `TWIN_CALLBACKS` under the global counters. The temperature threshold sets the value that the measured temperature must exceed in order for the data to be sent to IoT Hub.

    ```python
    TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = 25
    TWIN_CALLBACKS = RECEIVE_CALLBACKS = 0
    ```

7. Update the function `receive_message_callback` with below content.

    ```python
    # receive_message_callback is invoked when an incoming message arrives on the specified 
    # input queue (in the case of this sample, "input1").  Because this is a filter module, 
    # we will forward this message onto the "output1" queue.
    def receive_message_callback(message, hubManager):
        global RECEIVE_CALLBACKS
        global TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD
        message_buffer = message.get_bytearray()
        size = len(message_buffer)
        message_text = message_buffer[:size].decode('utf-8')
        print("    Data: <<<{}>>> & Size={:d}".format(message_text, size))
        map_properties = message.properties()
        key_value_pair = map_properties.get_internals()
        print("    Properties: {}".format(key_value_pair))
        RECEIVE_CALLBACKS += 1
        print("    Total calls received: {:d}".format(RECEIVE_CALLBACKS))
        data = json.loads(message_text)
        if "machine" in data and "temperature" in data["machine"] and data["machine"]["temperature"] > TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD:
            map_properties.add("MessageType", "Alert")
            print("Machine temperature {} exceeds threshold {}".format(data["machine"]["temperature"], TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD))
        hubManager.forward_event_to_output("output1", message, 0)
        return IoTHubMessageDispositionResult.ACCEPTED
    ```

8. Add a new function `device_twin_callback`. This function will be invoked when the desired properties are updated.

    ```python
    # device_twin_callback is invoked when twin's desired properties are updated.
    def device_twin_callback(update_state, payload, user_context):
        global TWIN_CALLBACKS
        global TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD
        print("\nTwin callback called with:\nupdateStatus = {}\npayload = {}\ncontext = {}".format(update_state, payload, user_context))
        data = json.loads(payload)
        if "desired" in data and "TemperatureThreshold" in data["desired"]:
            TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = data["desired"]["TemperatureThreshold"]
        if "TemperatureThreshold" in data:
            TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = data["TemperatureThreshold"]
        TWIN_CALLBACKS += 1
        print("Total calls confirmed: {:d}\n".format(TWIN_CALLBACKS))
    ```

9. In class `HubManager`, add a new line to the `__init__` method to initialize the `device_twin_callback` function you just added.

    ```python
    # sets the callback when a twin's desired properties are updated.
    self.client.set_device_twin_callback(device_twin_callback, self)
    ```

10. Save this file.

## Build your IoT Edge solution

1. Sign in to Docker by entering the following command in the VS Code integrated terminal: 
     
   ```csh/sh
   docker login -u <ACR username> -p <ACR password> <ACR login server>
   ```
   To find the user name, password and login server to use in this command, go to the [Azure portal] (https://portal.azure.com). From **All resources**, click the tile for your Azure container registry to open its properties, then click **Access keys**. Copy the values in the **Username**, **password**, and **Login server** fields. 

2. In VS Code explorer, click **deployment.template.json** to open it. This file describes the modules and routes for your IoT Edge solution. There are two modules will be deployed, one is the `tempSensor` and the other is `FilterModule`. In `FilterModule` section, the image URL is parsed from the `module.json` file in the **FilterModule** folder. In `routes` section under `$edgeHub`, you can see a `sensorToFilterModule` route, which routes the message from `tempSensor` to `FilterModule`.

3. Add below JSON content at the bottom of **deployment.template.json** for the `FilterModule` module twin and save this file: 
    ```json
        "FilterModule": {
            "properties.desired":{
                "TemperatureThreshold":25
            }
        }
    ```

4. Right-click the **deployment.template.json** file and click **Build IoT Edge solution**. VS Code then generates the actual `deployment.json` into **config** folder, builds your code, containerizes the Python codes and pushes it to the container registry you specified. You can get the full container image address with tag in the VS Code integrated terminal. For more information about the build and push definition, you can refer to the `module.json` file.

## Add registry credentials to Edge runtime
Add the credentials for your registry to the Edge runtime on the computer where you are running your Edge device. These credentials give the runtime access to pull the container. In VS Code command palette, type and run the command **Azure IoT Edge: Log in to Container Registry**. And then enter your ACR registry address, usename and password.

> [!NOTE]
> You can see actual command line in VS Code integrated terminal. For example, the command **Azure IoT Edge: Log in to Container Registry** will trigger below iotedgectl CLI to login. You can also run this command directly in VS Code integrated terminal.
> - For Windows, the login command is:
>     
>     ```cmd/sh
>     iotedgectl login --address <your container registry address> --username <username> --password <password> 
>     ```
> 
> - For Linux, the login command is:
>     
>     ```cmd/sh
>     sudo iotedgectl login --address <your container registry address> --username <username> --password <password> 
>     ```

## Deploy and run the solution

1. Configure the Azure IoT Toolkit extension with connection string for your IoT hub: 
    1. Open the VS Code explorer by selecting **View** > **Explorer**. 
    2. In the explorer, click **IOT HUB DEVICES** and then click **...**. Click **Select IoT Hub**. Follow the instructions to log in you Azure account and choose your IoT hub.

       > [!NOTE]
       > You can also setup by clicking **Set IoT Hub Connection String**. Enter the connection string for the IoT hub that your IoT Edge device connects to in the pop-up window. 

2. In Azure IoT Hub Devices explorer, right-click your IoT Edge device, then click **Setup IoT Edge**. Then run command **Azure IoT Edge: Start IoT Edge** in VS Code command palette.

3. In Azure IoT Hub Devices explorer, right-click your IoT Edge device, then click **Create Deployment for IoT Edge device**. Select the **deployment.json** file in the **config** folder and then click **Select Edge Deployment Manifest**.

4. Click the refresh button. You should see the new **FilterModule** running along with the **TempSensor** module and the **$edgeAgent** and **$edgeHub**. 

## View generated data

1. To monitor data arriving at the IoT hub, click **...**, and select **Start Monitoring D2C Messages**.
2. To monitor the D2C message for a specific device, right-click the device in the list, and select **Start Monitoring D2C Messages**.
3. To stop monitoring data, run the command **Azure IoT Hub: Stop monitoring D2C message** in command palette. 

## Next steps
