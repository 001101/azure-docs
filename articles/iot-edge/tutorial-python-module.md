# Develop and deploy a Python IoT Edge module to your simulated device - preview

You can use IoT Edge modules to deploy code that implements your business logic directly to your IoT Edge devices. This tutorial walks you through creating and deploying an IoT Edge module that filters sensor data. You'll use the simulated IoT Edge device that you created in the Deploy Azure IoT Edge on a simulated device in [Windows][lnk-tutorial1-win] or [Linux][lnk-tutorial1-lin] tutorials. In this tutorial, you learn how to:    

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use Visual Studio Code to create an IoT Edge Python module
> * Use Visual Studio Code and Docker to create a docker image and publish it to your registry 
> * Deploy the module to your IoT Edge device
> * View generated data


The IoT Edge module that you create in this tutorial filters the temperature data generated by your device. It only sends messages upstream if the temperature is above a specified threshold. This type of analysis at the edge is useful for reducing the amount of data communicated to and stored in the cloud. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bugbash-only** You can develop the Python module on your Windows or Mac machine, but can only deploy to Linux-AMD64 IoT Edge devices.

## Prerequisites

* The Azure IoT Edge device that you created in the quickstart or first tutorial.
* The primary key connection string for the IoT Edge device.  
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
* [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). 
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on the same computer that has Visual Studio Code. The Community Edition (CE) is sufficient for this tutorial. 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installation) for installing Python packages (typically included with your Python installation).

## Bugbash-only Prerequisites
* [Azure IoT Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit)
* [Azure IoT Edge extension for Visual Studio Code - 0.5.0-private2](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-iot-edge/releases/download/v0.5.0-private2/azure-iot-edge-0.5.0-private2.vsix).
    Download and save the VSIX file locally using the link provided. In VS Code, go to the **Extensions** view. Click the **...** then select **Install from VSIX...**. Reload the VS Code window to enable the extension.

## Create a container registry
In this tutorial, you use the Azure IoT Edge extension for VS Code to build a module and create a **container image** from the files. Then you push this image to a **registry** that stores and manages your images. Finally, you deploy your image from your registry to run on your IoT Edge device.  

You can use any Docker-compatible registry for this tutorial. Two popular Docker registry services available in the cloud are [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) and [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#viewing-repository-tags). This tutorial uses Azure Container Registry. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create a resource** > **Containers** > **Azure Container Registry**.
2. Give your registry a name, choose a subscription, choose a resource group, and set the SKU to **Basic**. 
3. Select **Create**.
4. Once your container registry is created, navigate to it and select **Access keys**. 
5. Toggle **Admin user** to **Enable**.
6. Copy the values for **Login server**, **Username**, and **Password**. You'll use these values later in the tutorial. 

## Create an IoT Edge module project
The following steps show you how to create an IoT Edge Python module using Visual Studio Code and the Azure IoT Edge extension.
1. In Visual Studio Code, select **View** > **Integrated Terminal** to open the VS Code integrated terminal.
2. In the integrated terminal, enter the following command to install (or update) **cookiecutter** (we suggest doing this either into a virtual environment or as a user install as shown below):

    ```cmd/sh
    pip install --upgrade --user cookiecutter
    ```

3. Select **View** > **Command Palette** to open the VS Code command palette. 
4. In the command palette, type and run the command **Azure IoT Edge: New IoT Edge solution**. In the command palette, provide the following information to create your solution: 
   1. Select the folder where you want to create the solution. 
   2. Provide a name for your solution or accept the default **EdgeSolution**.
   3. Choose **Python Module** as the module template. 
   4. Name your module **PythonModule**. 
   5. Specify the Azure Container Registry that you created in the previous section as the image repository for your first module. Replace **localhost:5000** with the login server value that you copied. The final string looks like **\<registry name\>.azurecr.io/pythonmodule**.
 
4. The VS Code window loads your IoT Edge solution workspace. There is a **modules** folder, a **.vscode** folder and a deployment manifest template file. Open **modules** > **PythonModule** > **main.py**.

5. At the top of the **main.py**, import the `json` library:

    ```python
    import json
    ```

6. Add the `TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD` and `TWIN_CALLBACKS` under the global counters. The temperature threshold sets the value that the measured temperature must exceed in order for the data to be sent to IoT Hub.

    ```python
    TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = 25
    TWIN_CALLBACKS = 0
    ```

7. Update the function `receive_message_callback` with below content.

    ```python
    # receive_message_callback is invoked when an incoming message arrives on the specified 
    # input queue (in the case of this sample, "input1").  Because this is a filter module, 
    # we will forward this message onto the "output1" queue.
    def receive_message_callback(message, hubManager):
        global RECEIVE_CALLBACKS
        global TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD
        message_buffer = message.get_bytearray()
        size = len(message_buffer)
        message_text = message_buffer[:size].decode('utf-8')
        print ( "    Data: <<<%s>>> & Size=%d" % (message_text, size) )
        map_properties = message.properties()
        key_value_pair = map_properties.get_internals()
        print ( "    Properties: %s" % key_value_pair )
        RECEIVE_CALLBACKS += 1
        print ( "    Total calls received: %d" % RECEIVE_CALLBACKS )
        data = json.loads(message_text)
        if "machine" in data and "temperature" in data["machine"] and data["machine"]["temperature"] > TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD:
            map_properties.add("MessageType", "Alert")
            print("Machine temperature %s exceeds threshold %s" % (data["machine"]["temperature"], TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD))
        hubManager.forward_event_to_output("output1", message, 0)
        return IoTHubMessageDispositionResult.ACCEPTED
    ```

8. Add a new function `module_twin_callback`. This function will be invoked when the desired properties are updated.

    ```python
    # module_twin_callback is invoked when twin's desired properties are updated.
    def module_twin_callback(update_state, payload, user_context):
        global TWIN_CALLBACKS
        global TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD
        print ( "\nTwin callback called with:\nupdateStatus = %s\npayload = %s\ncontext = %s" % (update_state, payload, user_context) )
        data = json.loads(payload)
        if "desired" in data and "TemperatureThreshold" in data["desired"]:
            TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = data["desired"]["TemperatureThreshold"]
        if "TemperatureThreshold" in data:
            TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = data["TemperatureThreshold"]
        TWIN_CALLBACKS += 1
        print ( "Total calls confirmed: %d\n" % TWIN_CALLBACKS )
    ```

9. In class `HubManager`, add a new line to the `__init__` method to initialize the `module_twin_callback` function you just added.

    ```python
    # sets the callback when a twin's desired properties are updated.
    self.client.set_module_twin_callback(module_twin_callback, self)
    ```

10. Save this file.

## Build your IoT Edge solution

In the previous section you created an IoT Edge solution and added code to the PythonModule that will filter out messages where the reported machine temperature is below the acceptable threshold. Now you need to build the solution as a container image and push it to your container registry. 

1. Sign in to Docker by entering the following command in the Visual Studio Code integrated terminal, so you can push your module image to the ACR: 
     
   ```csh/sh
   docker login -u <ACR username> -p <ACR password> <ACR login server>
   ```
   Use the username, password, and login server that you copied from your Azure Container Registry in the first section. Or retrieve them again from the **Access keys** section of your registry in the Azure portal.

2. In the VS Code explorer, open the **deployment.template.json** file in your IoT Edge solution workspace. This file tells the `$edgeAgent` to deploy two modules: **tempSensor** and **PythonModule**. The `PythonModule.image` value is set to a Linux amd64 version of the image. To learn more about deployment manifests, see [Understand how IoT Edge modules can be used, configured, and reused](module-composition.md).

3. Add the PythonModule module twin to the deployment manifest. Insert the following JSON content at the bottom of the `moduleContent` section, after the `$edgeHub` module twin: 
    ```json
        "PythonModule": {
            "properties.desired":{
                "TemperatureThreshold":25
            }
        }
    ```

4. Add the container repository credentials in the edgeAgent desired properties. **Bugbash-only** - The first credential is for the system module. The next credential is for your own ACR. Find the **EdgeShared** property under **registryCredentials**. Update the password field, then add your own registry information so that it looks like the following example: 

    ```json
        "EdgeShared": {
            "username":"EdgeShared",
            "password":"WPruG6Zt4OBs4hZySY9VQAp2dKEM/pDn",
            "address":"edgeshared.azurecr.io"
        },
        "YourACR": {
            "username":"[Username]",
            "password":"[Password]",
            "address":"[Login server]"
        }
    ```


5. Save this file.
6. In the VS Code explorer, right-click the **deployment.template.json** file and select **Build IoT Edge solution**. 

When you tell Visual Studio Code to build your solution, it first takes the information in the deployment template and generates a `deployment.json` file in a new **config** folder. Then it runs two commands in the integrated terminal: `docker build` and `docker push`. These two commands build your code, containerize the your Python code, and the push it to the container registry that you specified when you initialized the solution. 

You can see the full container image address with tag in the VS Code integrated terminal. The image address is built from information in the `module.json` file, with the format **\<repository\>:\<version\>-\<platform\>**. For this tutorial, it should look like **registryname.azurecr.io/pythonmodule:0.0.1-amd64**.

## Deploy and run the solution

1. Configure the Azure IoT Toolkit extension with connection string for your IoT hub: 
    1. Open the VS Code explorer by selecting **View** > **Explorer**. 
    2. In the explorer, click **AZURE IOT HUB DEVICES** and then click **...**. Click **Select IoT Hub**. Follow the instructions to log in you Azure account and choose your IoT hub.

       > [!NOTE]
       > You can also setup by clicking **Set IoT Hub Connection String**. Enter the connection string for the IoT hub that your IoT Edge device connects to in the pop-up window. 

2. In Azure IoT Hub Devices explorer, right-click your IoT Edge device, then click **Create Deployment for IoT Edge device**. Select the **deployment.json** file in the **config** folder and then click **Select Edge Deployment Manifest**.

3. Click the refresh button. You should see the new **PythonModule** running along with the **TempSensor** module and the **$edgeAgent** and **$edgeHub**. 

       > [!NOTE]
       > **Bugbash-only** The Python Device SDK is a wrapper of the C SDK and C SDK domain sockets aren’t present yet. This means in your config.yaml on your IoT Edge device, you’ll need to tell edgelet lo listen on HTTP. In the sample below, replace the IP’s with the IP of the device itself.  (It needs to be IP – just using the device name WILL NOT WORK because of the way that docker & /etc/hosts interact).
       > ```yaml
       > connect:
       >   management_uri: "http://10.91.136.196:8080"
       >   workload_uri: http://10.91.136.196:8081
       > listen:
       >   management_uri: "http://0.0.0.0:8080"
       >   workload_uri: "http://0.0.0.0:8081"
       > ```


## View generated data

1. To monitor data arriving at the IoT hub, click **...**, and select **Start Monitoring D2C Messages**.
2. To monitor the D2C message for a specific device, right-click the device in the list, and select **Start Monitoring D2C Messages**.
3. To stop monitoring data, run the command **Azure IoT Hub: Stop monitoring D2C message** in command palette. 

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an IoT Edge module that contains code to filter raw data generated by your IoT Edge device. You can continue on to either of the following tutorials to learn about other ways that Azure IoT Edge can help you turn data into business insights at the edge.
