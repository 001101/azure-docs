# Common issues and resolutions for Azure IoT Edge

If you experience issues running Azure IoT Edge in your environment, use this article as a guide for troubleshooting and resolution. 

## Standard diagnostic steps 

When you encounter an issue, learn more about the state of your IoT Edge device by reviewing the container logs and messages that pass to and from the device. Use the commands and tools in this section to gather information. 

* Look at the logs of the docker containers to detect issues. Start with your deployed containers, then look at the containers that make up the IoT Edge runtime: Edge Agent and Edge Hub. The Edge Agent logs typically provide info on the lifecycle of each container. The Edge Hub logs provide info on messaging and routing. 

   ```cmd
   docker logs <container name>
   ```

* View the messages going through the Edge Hub, and gather insights on device properties updates with verbose logs from the runtime containers.

   ```cmd
   iotedgectl setup --connection-string "{device connection string}" --runtime-log-level debug
   ```
   
* View verbose logs from iotedgectl commands:

   ```cmd
   iotedgectl --verbose DEBUG <command>
   ```

* If you experience connectivity issues, inspect your edge device environment variables like your device connection string:

   ```cmd
   docker exec edgeAgent printenv
   ```

You can also check the messages being sent between IoT Hub and the IoT Edge devices. View these messages by using the [Azure IoT Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit) extension for Visual Studio Code. For more guidance, see [Handy tool when you develop with Azure IoT](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/iotdev/2017/09/01/handy-tool-when-you-develop-with-azure-iot/).

After investigating the logs and messages for information, you can also try restarting the Azure IoT Edge runtime:

   ```cmd
   iotedgectl restart
   ```

## Edge Agent stops after about a minute

The Edge Agent starts and runs successfully for about a minute, then stops. The logs indicate that the Edge Agent is attempting to connect to IoT Hub over AMQP, and then approximately 30 seconds later attempt to connect using AMQP over websocket. When that fails, the Edge Agent exits. 

Example Edge Agent logs:

```output
2017-11-28 18:46:19 [INF] - Starting module management agent. 
2017-11-28 18:46:19 [INF] - Version - 1.0.7516610 (03c94f85d0833a861a43c669842f0817924911d5) 
2017-11-28 18:46:19 [INF] - Edge agent attempting to connect to IoT Hub via AMQP... 
2017-11-28 18:46:49 [INF] - Edge agent attempting to connect to IoT Hub via AMQP over WebSocket... 
```

### Root cause
A networking configuration on the host network is preventing the Edge Agent from reaching the network. The agent attempts to connect over AMQP (port 5671) first. If this fails, it tries websockets (port 443).

The IoT Edge runtime sets up a network for each of the modules to communicate on. On Linux, this network is a bridge network. On Windows, it uses NAT. This issue is more common on Windows devices using Windows containers that use the NAT network. 

### Resolution
Ensure that there is a route to the internet for the IP addresses assigned to this bridge/NAT network. Sometimes a VPN configuration on the host overrides the IoT Edge network. 

## Edge Hub fails to start

The Edge Hub fails to start, and prints the following message to the logs: 

```output
One or more errors occurred. 
(Docker API responded with status code=InternalServerError, response=
{\"message\":\"driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint edgeHub (6a82e5e994bab5187939049684fb64efe07606d2bb8a4cc5655b2a9bad5f8c80): 
Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:443 failed: port is already allocated\"}\n) 
```

### Root cause
Some other process on the host machine has bound port 443. The Edge Hub maps ports 5671 and 443 for use in gateway scenarios. This port mapping fails if another process has already bound this port. 

### Resolution
Find and stop the process that is using port 443. This process is usually a web server.

## Edge Agent can't access a module's image (403)
A container fails to run, and the Edge Agent logs show a 403 error. 

### Root cause
The Edge Agent doesn't have permissions to access a module's image. 

### Resolution
Try running the `iotedgectl login` command again.

## iotedgectl can't find Docker
iotedgectl fails to execute the setup or start command and prints the following message to the logs:
```output
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/edgectl/host/dockerclient.py", line 98, in get_os_type
  info = self._client.info()
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/client.py", line 174, in info
  return self.api.info(*args, **kwargs)
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/api/daemon.py", line 88, in info
  return self._result(self._get(self._url("/info")), True)
```

### Root cause
iotedgectl can't find Docker, which is a pre-requisite.

### Resolution
Install Docker, make sure that it is running and retry.

## Firewall and Port configuration rules for IoT Edge deployment
Azure IoT Edge allows communication from an on-premise Edge server to Azure cloud using supported IoT Hub protocols, see [choosing a communication protocol](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-protocols.md). For enhanced security, communication channels between Azure IoT Edge and Azure IoT Hub are always configured to be Outbound; this is based on the [Services Assisted Communication pattern](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/clemensv/2014/02/09/service-assisted-communication-for-connected-devices/) which minimizes the attack surface for a malicious entity to explore. Inbound communication is only required for specific scenarios where Azure IoT Hub need to push messages down to the Azure IoT Edge server (e.g., Cloud To Device messaging), these are again protected using secure TLS channels and can be further secured using X.509 certificates and TPM device modules. The Azure IoT Edge Security Manager governs how this communication can be established, see [IoT Edge Security Manager](../iot-edge/iot-edge-security-manager.md).

While IoT Edge provides enhanced configuration for securing Azure IoT Edge runtime and deployed modules, it is still dependant on the underlying machine and network configuration. Hence, it is imperative to ensure proper network and firewall rules are set up for secure Edge to Cloud communication. The following can be used as a guideline when configuration firewall rules for the underlying servers where Azure IoT Edge runtime is hosted:

|Protocol|Port|Incoming|Outgoing|Guidance|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|MQTT|8883|BLOCKED (Default)|BLOCKED (Default)|<ul> <li>Configure Outgoing (Outbound) to be Open when using MQTT as the communication protocol.<li>1883 for MQTT is not supported by IoT Edge. <li>Incoming (Inbound) connections should be blocked.</ul>|
|AMQP|5671|BLOCKED (Default)|OPEN (Default)|<ul> <li>Default communication protocol for IoT Edge. <li> Must be configured to be Open if Azure IoT Edge is not configured for other supported protocols or AMQP is the desired communication protocol.<li>5672 for AMQP is not supported by IoT Edge.<li>Block this port when Azure IoT Edge use a different IoT Hub supported protocol.<li>Incoming (Inbound) connections should be blocked.</ul></ul>|
|HTTPS|443|BLOCKED (Default)|OPEN (Default)|<ul> <li>Configure Outgoing (Outbound) to be Open on 443 for IoT Edge provisioning, this is required when using manual scripts or Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service (DPS). <li>Incoming (Inbound) connection should be Open only for specific scenarios: <ul> <li>  If you have a transparent gateway with leaf devices that may send method requests. In this case, Port 443 does not need to be open to external networks to connect to IoTHub or provide IoTHub services through Azure IoT Edge. Thus the incoming rule could be restricted to only open Incoming (Inbound) from the internal network. <li> For Client to Device (C2D) scenarios.</ul><li>80 for HTTP is not supported by IoT Edge.<li>If non HTTP protocols (e.g. AMQP, MQTT) cannot be configured in the enterprise; the messages can be sent over WebSockets. Port 443 will be used for WebSocket communication in that case.</ul>|
