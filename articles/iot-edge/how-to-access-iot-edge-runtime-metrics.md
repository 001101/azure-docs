# Remote access to IoT Edge runtime metrics

The IoT Edge runtime components, IoT Edge Hub and IoT Edge Agent, produce metrics in the [Prometheus exposition format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). Access these metrics remotely to monitor and understand the health of an IoT Edge device.

## Metrics exposure

As of release 1.0.10, metrics are automatically exposed by default on **port 9600** of the **edgeHub** and **edgeAgent** modules (`http://edgeHub:9600/metrics` and `http://edgeAgent:9600/metics`). They aren't port mapped to the host by default.

For mapping to host, expose the port from the edgeHub module's `createOptions`:

```
{
  "ExposedPorts": {
    "9600/tcp": {},
  }
  <other options, if any>
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to disable metrics, set the `MetricsEnabled` environment variable to `false` for **edgeAgent**.

## Metrics collection

A **metrics collector module** is required to gather metrics exposed by the IoT Edge runtime and send them to the cloud. You can create your own or use the public sample module provided at `azureiotedge/azureiotedge-metrics-collector-sample:0.1`. To view the code for the sample module, see the [MetricsCollector project](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/tree/master/edge-modules/MetricsCollector).

This module collects metrics and sends them to an [Azure Log Analytics Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace). It uses the **settings.json** file to target a workspace:

```json
    {
       "LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId": "",
       "LogAnalyticsSharedKey": "",
       "LogAnalyticsLogType": "IoTEdgeMetrics",
       "MetricsEndpointsCSV": "http://edgeHub:9600/metrics,http://edgeAgent:9600/metrics",
       "ScrapeFrequencyInSecs": 300,
       "UploadTarget": "AzureLogAnalytics",
       "MessageIdentifier": "IoTEdgeMetrics"
    }
```

To test the sample metrics collector module, you will need an **IoT Edge device**. The following steps will help you configure the rest of the resources you need:

1. Create an **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**:
    1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    2. In the left pane, select **Create a resource**, and then search for **Log Analytics Workspace**.  

    3. Select **Create**. Select your **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and **Region**. Provide a unique name for your workspace.

    4. Select **Review + create** and then, once validation passes, **Create**.

    5. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.

    6. In the left-hand panel, under **Settings**, select **Agents management**. Note the **Workspace ID** and **Primary key**.

    ![Note the workspace ID and key for your Log Analytics Workspace](./media/how-to-access-iot-edge-runtime-metrics/log-analytics-workspace-id-and-key.png)

2. Navigate to your **IoT Edge device** and create your deployment:

    1. Select **Set modules**.

    2. Add a **SimulatedTemperatureSensor** from the **Azure Marketplace** to the deployment.

    3. Add the **MetricsCollector** using an **IoT Edge Module** and enter `azureiotedge/azureiotedge-metrics-collector-sample:0.1` for the **Image URI**.

    4. Set the **MetricsCollector** module's environment variables to the following name-value pairs:

        | Name | Value |
        |-|-|
        | LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId | {Workspace ID} |
        | LogAnalyticsSharedKey | {Primary key} |
        | Log AnalyticsLogType | `promMetrics` |
        | MetricsEndpointsCSV | http://edgeHub:9600/metrics,http://edgeAgent:9600/metrics (add metrics URLs from additional modules exposing Prometheus endpoints using this comma-separated list) |
        | ScrapeFrequencyInSecs | 300 (use this value to increase or decrease collection frequency) |
        | UploadTarget | AzureLogAnalytics |

    5. Select **Review + create** and, once validation passes, **Create**.

    ![Configure the MetricsCollector module with the environment variables](./media/how-to-access-iot-edge-runtime-metrics/create-deployment-for-metrics.png)

3. Once your modules successfully deploy, it may take up to 20 minutes for metrics data to appear in your workspace. It will normally take 5-10 minutes. Navigate to your **Azure Log Analytics Workspace** and view your device's metrics:

    1. In the left-hand panel, under **General**, select **Logs**.

    2. Type the query `promMetrics_CL` and select **Run**.

    ![Use the promMetrics_CL query to view your device's metrics](./media/how-to-access-iot-edge-runtime-metrics/logs-query.png)

Expand a metric entry to view the details of the collected metric. For each metric, you will see a **TimeGenerated**, a **Name**, a **Value**, and its corresponding **Tags**.

See the following section for what metrics are exposed and their components.

## Available metrics

Metrics contain tags to help identify the nature of the metric being collected. All metrics contain the following tags:

| Tag | Description |
|-|-|
| iothub | The hub the device is talking to |
| edge_device | The ID of the current device |
| instance_number | A GUID representing the current runtime. On restart, all metrics will be reset. This GUID makes it easier to reconcile restarts. |

In the Prometheus exposition format, there are four core metric types: counter, gauge, histogram, and summary. For more information about the different metric types, see the [Prometheus metric types documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/).

The **edgeHub** module produces the following metrics:
