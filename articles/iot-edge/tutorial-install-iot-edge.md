# Deploy Azure IoT Edge on a simulated device - Public preview

Azure IoT Edge moves the power of the cloud to your Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This tutorial walks you through creating a simulated IoT Edge device that generates sensor data. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an IoT hub
> * Register an IoT Edge device
> * Start the IoT Edge runtime
> * Deploy a module
> * View generated data

The simulated device that you create in this tutorial is a monitor on a wind turbine that generates temperature, humidity, and pressure data. You're interested in this data because your turbines perform at different levels of efficiency depending on the weather conditions. The other Azure IoT Edge tutorials build upon the work you do here by deploying modules that analyze the data for business insights. 

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you're using a computer or virtual machine to simulate an Internet of Things device. The following services are required to successfully deploy an IoT Edge device:

- Docker
   - [Install Docker on Windows][lnk-docker-windows] and make sure it's running.
   - [Install Docker on Linux][lnk-docker-ubuntu] and make sure it's running. 
- Python 2.7
   - [Install Python 2.7 on Windows][lnk-python-windows].
   - Most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, already have Python 2.7 installed. Use the following command to make sure that pip is installed: `sudo apt-get install python-pip`.

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-create-hub.md)]

## Register an IoT Edge device

Create a device identity for your simulated device so that it can communicate with your IoT hub. Since IoT Edge devices behave and can be managed differently than typical IoT devices, you declare this to be an IoT Edge device from the beginning. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your IoT hub.
1. Select **IoT Edge Explorer**.
1. Select **Add Edge device**.
1. Give your simulated device a unique device ID.
1. Confirm that the value of **Azure IoT Edge device** is set to **Yes**.
1. Select **Save** to add your device.
1. Select your new device from the list of devices. 
1. Copy the value for **Connection string--primary key** and save it. You'll use this value to configure the IoT Edge runtime in the next section. 

## Install and start the IoT Edge runtime

The IoT Edge runtime is deployed on all IoT Edge devices. It comprises two modules. First, the IoT Edge agent facilitates deployment and monitoring of modules on the IoT Edge device. Second, the IoT Edge hub manages communications between modules on the IoT Edge device, and between the device and IoT Hub. 

>[!TIP]
>This section gives the Python 2.7 commands for Windows. If you're running this tutorial on Linux, add `sudo` in front of each command. 

Use the following steps to install and start the IoT Edge runtime:

> [!NOTE]
> Remove before merging. During bug bash: Instead of step 1, run the following code:
>
> (linux):
> `wget https://azureiotedgepreview.blob.core.windows.net/shared/azure-iot-edge-ctl.tar.gz`
> `tar xvzf azure-iot-edge-ctl-1.0.0rc6.dev6995193.tar.gz`
> `cd azure-iot-edge-ctl-1.0.0rc6.dev6995193`
> `sudo pip install -U .`
>
> (windows):
>
> Download [scripts](https://azureiotedgepreview.blob.core.windows.net/shared/azure-iot-edge-ctl.zip)
>
> Extract all
>
> Open cmd in extracted dir
>
> `pip install -U .[win32]`



1. On the machine where you'll run the IoT Edge device, download the IoT Edge control script.

   ```
   pip install -U azure-iot-edge-runtime-ctl
   ```

1. Configure the runtime with your IoT Edge device connection string from the previous section.

   ```
   iotedgectl setup --connection-string "{device connection string}" --auto-cert-gen-force-no-passwords
   ```

1. Start the runtime.

   ```
   iotedgectl start
   ```

1. Check Docker to see that the IoT Edge agent is running as a module.

   ```
   docker ps
   ```

## Deploy a module

One of the key capabilities of Azure IoT Edge is being able to deploy modules to your IoT Edge devices from the cloud. An IoT Edge module is an executable package implemented as a container. In this section, you deploy a module that generates telemetry for your simulated device. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your IoT hub.
1. Go to **IoT Edge Explorer** and select your IoT Edge device.
1. Select **Deploy modules**.
1. Select **Add custom IoT Edge module**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter `tempSensor`. 
1. In the **Image** field, enter `edgepreview.azurecr.io/azureiotedge/simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0-preview`. 
1. Leave the other settings unchanged, and select **Save**.
1. Back in the **Add modules** step, select **Next**.
1. In the **Specify routes** step, select **Next**.
1. In the **Review template** step, select **Submit**.
1. Return to the device details page and select **Refresh**. You should see the new tempSensor module running along the IoT Edge runtime. 

   ![View tempSensor in list of deployed modules][1]

## View generated data

You can monitor your new IoT Edge device's status by clicking on it in IoT Edge Explorer page of your IoT hub. 

You can view the telemetry the device is sending by using the [IoT Hub explorer tool][lnk-iothub-explorer].

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a new IoT Edge device and used the Azure IoT Edge cloud interface to deploy code onto the device. Now, you have a simulated device generating raw data about its environment. 

This tutorial is the prerequisite for all of the other IoT Edge tutorials. You can continue on to any of the other tutorials to learn how Azure IoT Edge can help you turn this data into business insights at the edge.
