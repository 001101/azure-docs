# Quickstart: Deploy your first IoT Edge module from the Azure portal to a Windows device - preview

In this quickstart, use the Azure IoT Edge cloud interface to deploy prebuilt code remotely to an IoT Edge device. To accomplish this task, first use your Windows device to simulate an IoT Edge device, then you can deploy a module to it.

In this quickstart you learn how to:

1. Create an IoT Hub.
2. Register an IoT Edge device to your IoT hub.
3. Start the IoT Edge runtime.
4. Remotely deploy a module to an IoT Edge device.

![Tutorial architecture][2]

The module that you deploy in this quickstart is a simulated sensor that generates temperature, humidity, and pressure data. The other Azure IoT Edge tutorials build upon the work you do here by deploying modules that analyze the simulated data for business insights. 

If you don't have an active Azure subscription, create a [free account][lnk-account] before you begin.

## Prerequisites

This quickstart assumes that you're using a computer or virtual machine running Windows to simulate an Internet of Things device. If you're running Windows in a virtual machine, enable [nested virtualization][lnk-nested] and allocate at least 2GB memory. 

1. Make sure you're using a supported Windows version:
   * Windows 10 
   * Windows Server
2. Install [Docker for Windows][lnk-docker] and make sure it's running.
3. Install [Python on Windows][lnk-python] and make sure you can use the pip command. This quickstart was tested with Python versions >=2.7.9 and >=3.5.4.  
4. Run the following command to download the IoT Edge control script.

   ```cmd
   pip install -U azure-iot-edge-runtime-ctl
   ```

5. You use the Azure CLI to complete many of the steps in this quickstart, and Azure IoT has an extension to enable additional functionality. You can complete these steps in the cloud shell in the Azure portal.
    * Sign in to the [Azure portal][lnk-portal]. 
    * Select the **Cloud Shell** button. 

       ![Cloud Shell button][1]

    * Run the following command in the cloud shell:

       ```azurecli
       az extension show --name azure-cli-iot-ext
       ```

> [!NOTE]
> Azure IoT Edge can run either Windows containers or Linux containers. To use Windows containers, you have to run:
>    * Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, or
>    * Windows Server 1709 (Build 16299), or
>    * Windows IoT Core (Build 16299) on a x64-based device
>
> For Windows IoT Core, follow the instructions in [Install the IoT Edge runtime on Windows IoT Core][lnk-install-iotcore]. Otherwise, simply [configure Docker to use Windows containers][lnk-docker-containers], and optionally validate your prerequisites with the following powershell command:
>    ```powershell
>    Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -useb https://aka.ms/iotedgewin)
>    ```

## Create an IoT hub with Azure CLI

Start the quickstart by creating your IoT Hub in the Azure portal.
![Create IoT Hub][3]

The free level of IoT Hub works for this quickstart. If you've used IoT Hub in the past and already have a free hub created, you can skip this section and go on to [Register an IoT Edge device][anchor-register]. Each subscription can only have one free IoT hub. 

1. Use the Azure cloud shell to create a resource group. The following code creates a resource group called **IoTEdge** in the **West US** region:

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name IoTEdge --location westus
   ```

1. Create an IoT hub in your new resource group. The following code creates a free **F1** hub called **MyIotHub** in the resource group **IoTEdge**:

   ```azurecli
   az iot hub create --resource-group IoTEdge --name MyIotHub --sku F1 
   ```

## Register an IoT Edge device

Register an IoT Edge device with your newly created IoT Hub.
![Register a device][4]

Create a device identity for your simulated device so that it can communicate with your IoT hub. Since IoT Edge devices behave and can be managed differently than typical IoT devices, you declare this to be an IoT Edge device from the beginning. 

1. In the Azure cloud shell, enter the following command to create a device named **myEdgeDevice** in your hub **MyIoTHub**

   ```azurecli
   az iot hub device-identity create --device-id myEdgeDevice --hub-name MyIoTHub --edge-enabled
   ```

1. Retrieve the connection string for your device, which links your physical device with its identity in IoT Hub. 

   ```azurecli
   az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --device-id myEdgeDevice --hub-name MyIoTHub
   ```

1. Copy the connection string and save it. You'll use this value to configure the IoT Edge runtime in the next section. 

## Install and start the IoT Edge runtime

Install and start the Azure IoT Edge runtime on your device. 
![Register a device][5]

The IoT Edge runtime is deployed on all IoT Edge devices. It comprises two modules. First, the IoT Edge agent facilitates deployment and monitoring of modules on the IoT Edge device. Second, the IoT Edge hub manages communications between modules on the IoT Edge device, and between the device and IoT Hub. 

Configure the runtime with your IoT Edge device connection string from the previous section.

```cmd
iotedgectl setup --connection-string "{device connection string}" --nopass
```

Start the runtime.

```cmd
iotedgectl start
```

Check Docker to see that the IoT Edge agent is running as a module.

```cmd
docker ps
```

![See edgeAgent in Docker](./media/tutorial-simulate-device-windows/docker-ps.png)

## Deploy a module

Manage your Azure IoT Edge device from the cloud to deploy a module that will send telemetry data to IoT Hub.
![Register a device][6]

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-deploy-module](../../includes/iot-edge-deploy-module.md)]

## View generated data

In this quickstart, you created a new IoT Edge device and installed the IoT Edge runtime on it. Then, you used the Azure portal to push an IoT Edge module to run on the device without having to make changes to the device itself. In this case, the module that you pushed creates environmental data that you can use for the tutorials. 

Open the command prompt on the computer running your simulated device again. Confirm that the module deployed from the cloud is running on your IoT Edge device. 

```cmd
docker ps
```

![View three modules on your device](./media/tutorial-simulate-device-windows/docker-ps2.png)

View the messages being sent from the tempSensor module to the cloud. 

```cmd
docker logs -f tempSensor
```

![View the data from your module](./media/tutorial-simulate-device-windows/docker-logs.png)

You can also view the telemetry the device is sending by using the [IoT Hub explorer tool][lnk-iothub-explorer]. 
## Clean up resources

If you want to remove the simulated device that you created, along with the Docker containers that were started for each module, use the following command: 

```cmd
iotedgectl uninstall
```

When you no longer need the IoT Hub you created, you can use the [az iot hub delete][lnk-delete] command to remove the resource and any devices associated with it:

```azurecli
az iot hub delete --name MyIoTHub --resource-group IoTEdge
```

## Next steps

This quickstart is the prerequisite for all of the IoT Edge tutorials. You can continue on to any of the other tutorials to learn how Azure IoT Edge can help you turn this data into business insights at the edge.
