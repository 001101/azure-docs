# Deploy and monitor IoT Edge modules at scale using Visual Studio Code

Create an **IoT Edge automatic deployment** using Visual Studio Code to manage ongoing deployments for many devices at once. Automatic deployments for IoT Edge are part of the [automatic device management](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-automatic-device-management) feature of IoT Hub. Deployments are dynamic processes that enable you to deploy multiple modules to multiple devices, track the status and health of the modules, and make changes when necessary. 

For more information, see [Understand IoT Edge automatic deployments for single devices or at scale](module-deployment-monitoring.md).

In this article, you set up Visual Studio Code and the IoT extension. You then learn how to deploy modules to a set of IoT Edge devices and monitor the progress using Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

* An [IoT hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in your Azure subscription.
* An [IoT Edge device](how-to-register-device.md#register-with-visual-studio-code) with the IoT Edge runtime installed.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* [Azure IoT Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools#overview) for Visual Studio Code.

## Configure a deployment manifest

A deployment manifest is a JSON document that describes which modules to deploy, how data flows between the modules, and desired properties of the module twins. For more information, see [Learn how to deploy modules and establish routes in IoT Edge](module-composition.md).

To deploy modules using Visual Studio Code, save the deployment manifest locally as a .JSON file. You use the file path in the next section when you run the command to apply the configuration to your device. 

Here's a basic deployment manifest with one module as an example:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "modulesContent": {
      "$edgeAgent": {
        "properties.desired": {
          "schemaVersion": "1.0",
          "runtime": {
            "type": "docker",
            "settings": {
              "minDockerVersion": "v1.25",
              "loggingOptions": "",
              "registryCredentials": {}
            }
          },
          "systemModules": {
            "edgeAgent": {
              "type": "docker",
              "settings": {
                "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-agent:1.0",
                "createOptions": "{}"
              }
            },
            "edgeHub": {
              "type": "docker",
              "status": "running",
              "restartPolicy": "always",
              "settings": {
                "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-hub:1.0",
                "createOptions": "{\"HostConfig\":{\"PortBindings\":{\"5671/tcp\":[{\"HostPort\":\"5671\"}],\"8883/tcp\":[{\"HostPort\":\"8883\"}],\"443/tcp\":[{\"HostPort\":\"443\"}]}}}"
              }
            }
          },
          "modules": {
            "SimulatedTemperatureSensor": {
              "version": "1.0",
              "type": "docker",
              "status": "running",
              "restartPolicy": "always",
              "settings": {
                "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0",
                "createOptions": "{}"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "$edgeHub": {
        "properties.desired": {
          "schemaVersion": "1.0",
          "routes": {
            "upstream": "FROM /messages/* INTO $upstream"
          },
          "storeAndForwardConfiguration": {
            "timeToLiveSecs": 7200
          }
        }
      },
      "SimulatedTemperatureSensor": {
        "properties.desired": {
          "SendData": true,
          "SendInterval": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Sign in to access your IoT hub

You can use the Azure IoT extensions for Visual Studio Code to perform operations with your IoT hub. For these operations to work, you need to sign in to your Azure account and select the IoT hub that you are working on.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **Explorer** view.

1. At the bottom of the Explorer, expand the **Azure IoT Hub** section.

1. Click on the **...** in the **Azure IoT Hub** section header. If you don't see the ellipsis, hover over the header.

1. Choose **Select IoT Hub**.

1. If you are not signed in to your Azure account, follow the prompts to do so.

1. Select your Azure subscription.

1. Select your IoT hub.

## Create deployment for single device

You deploy modules to your target devices by creating a deployment that consists of the deployment manifest as well as other parameters.

You deploy modules to your device by applying the deployment manifest that you configured with the module information.

1. In the Visual Studio Code explorer view, expand the **Azure IoT Hub** section, and then expand the **Devices** node.

1. Right-click on the IoT Edge device that you want to configure with the deployment manifest.

    > [!TIP]
    > To confirm that the device you've chosen is an IoT Edge device, select it to expand the list of modules and verify the presence of **$edgeHub** and **$edgeAgent**. Every IoT Edge device includes these two modules.

1. Select **Create Deployment for Single Device**.

1. Navigate to the deployment manifest JSON file that you want to use, and click **Select Edge Deployment Manifest**.

   ![Select Edge Deployment Manifest](./media/how-to-deploy-modules-vscode/select-deployment-manifest.png)

The results of your deployment are printed in the VS Code output. Successful deployments are applied within a few minutes if the target device is running and connected to the internet.

## Create deployment for multiple devices

## View modules on your device

Once you've deployed modules to your device, you can view all of them in the **Azure IoT Hub** section. Select the arrow next to your IoT Edge device to expand it. All the currently running modules are displayed.

If you recently deployed new modules to a device, hover over the **Azure IoT Hub Devices** section header and select the refresh icon to update the view.

Right-click the name of a module to view and edit the module twin.
