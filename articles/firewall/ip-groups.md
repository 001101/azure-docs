# IP Groups (preview) in Azure Firewall

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This public preview is provided without a service level agreement and should not be used for production workloads. Certain features may not be supported, may have constrained capabilities, or may not be available in all Azure locations. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for details.

IP Groups allow you to group and manage IP addresses for Azure Firewall rules in the following ways:

- As a source or destination address in network rules
- As a source address in application rules
- As a source address in DNAT rules

An IP Group can have a single IP address, a group of IP addresses, or one or more IP address ranges.

## Creating IP groups

An IP Group can be created using the Azure portal . For more information, see xxx.

## Using an IP Group

When you create an Azure Firewall rule, you can now select **IP Group** as a **Source type** for the IP address.
