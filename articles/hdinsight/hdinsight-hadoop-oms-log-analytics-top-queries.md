#  Queries for monitoring Azure HDInsight clusters using Log Analytics

This article lists the Log Analytics queries that you can use to monitor Azure HDInsight cluster. These queries help you collect data about the cluster, jobs running on the cluster, as well as logs generated on the cluster.

## Queries for cluster health

* List the unhealthy nodes in a cluster for all cluster types

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_clustermetrics_CL) |measure max(NumUnhealthyNMs_d) by ClusterName_s

* List the unhealthy nodes in a cluster for a specific cluster type. As an example, the following query lists the unhealthy nodes across all clusters only for Hadoop clusters. 

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_clustermetrics_CL)( ClusterType_s=hadoop) |measure max(NumUnhealthyNMs_d) by ClusterName_s

* List all the information for a specific cluster. Replace <cluster_name> with the name of an HDInsight cluster.

        ClusterName_s=<cluster name>

## Queries for cluster jobs

* List all the jobs currently running on all HDInsight clusters

* List all the jobs submitted to any HDInsight cluster

* List all the completed jobs that were submitted to any HDInsight cluster

* List all the jobs that are pending to run on any HDInsight cluster

* 


## Queries for cluster logs
