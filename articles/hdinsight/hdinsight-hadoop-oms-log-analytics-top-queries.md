#  Queries for monitoring Azure HDInsight clusters using Log Analytics

This article lists the Log Analytics queries that you can use to monitor Azure HDInsight cluster. These queries help you collect data about the cluster, jobs running on the cluster, as well as logs generated on the cluster.

## Queries for cluster health

* List the unhealthy nodes in a cluster for all cluster types

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_clustermetrics_CL) |measure max(NumUnhealthyNMs_d) by ClusterName_s

* List the unhealthy nodes in a cluster for a specific cluster type. As an example, the following query lists the unhealthy nodes across all clusters only for Hadoop clusters. 

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_clustermetrics_CL)( ClusterType_s=hadoop) |measure max(NumUnhealthyNMs_d) by ClusterName_s

* List all the information for a specific cluster. Replace <cluster_name> with the name of an HDInsight cluster.

        ClusterName_s=<cluster name>

## Queries for cluster jobs

* List all the jobs currently running on all HDInsight clusters

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_queue_root_CL) |measure max(AppsRunning_d) as AppsRunning by ClusterName_s interval 1HOUR

* List all the jobs submitted to any HDInsight cluster

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_queue_root_CL) |measure max(AppsSubmitted_d) as AppsSubmitted by ClusterName_s interval 1HOUR

* List all the completed jobs that were submitted to any HDInsight cluster

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_queue_root_CL) |measure max(AppsCompleted_d) as AppsCompleted by ClusterName_s interval 1HOUR

* List all the jobs that are pending to run on any HDInsight cluster

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_queue_root_CL) |measure max(AppsPending_d) as AppsPending by ClusterName_s interval 1HOUR

* List all the jobs that failed to complete successfully on any HDInsight clusters

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_queue_root_CL) |measure max(AppsFailed_d) as AppsFailed by ClusterName_s interval 1HOUR

* List all the jobs that were forcefully terminated on any HDInsight cluster

        (Type=metrics_resourcemanager_queue_root_CL) |measure max(AppsKilled_d) as AppsKilled by ClusterName_s interval 1HOUR 

## Queries related to Spark clusters

* Query the overall memory usage.

        (TimeGenerated>NOW-12hour) Type = log_sparkappsdriver_metrics_CL jvm "total.used" | measure avg(Value_d) by ClusterName_s interval 1minute

* Query the number of tasks running in Executors.

        (TimeGenerated>NOW-12hour) Type = log_sparkappsdriver_metrics_CL "threadpool.activeTasks" |measure sum(Value_d) by ClusterName_s interval 1minute

* Query the processing latency of Spark streaming jobs. Replace <application name> with the name of your Spark streaming application.

        Type=log_sparkappsdriver_metrics_CL Source_s="<application_name>.StreamingMetrics" "streaming.lastCompletedBatch_processingDelay" | measure avg(Value_d) by Source_s interval 1minute

    `streaming.lastReceivedBatch_records` and `streaming.waitingBatches` are the other two important parameters that you can use to get more data on Spark streaming applications.
