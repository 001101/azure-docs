# End to End Extract Transform and Load (ETL) Pipeline using Azure HDInsight 

Consider this: you're a large company with stores all across the world that sells many products in different departments. You have large amounts of sales data from the different stores and would like to see revenue trends and other business insights from it. After looking into Microsoftâ€™s Azure HDInsight, you think it might be a great tool to understanding data associated with the company. 

You decide to build an ETL pipeline using Azure services. This pipeline combines the data from all your different stores, removes any unwanted data, appends new data, and loads this back to your storage to visualize business insights. Read more about ETL pipelines [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hadoop/apache-hadoop-etl-at-scale). 

You also see that you can build out this entire pipeline using Azure products, with HDInsight being the primary mode for data transformations. Given the large volume of data associated with the multitudes of stores, a big data product like HDInsight provides the perfect solution to transforming and analyzing this data quickly and at scale.

### Overview

In this tutorial you will build an end to end ETL pipeline. The pipeline will use an ADLS Gen2 Storage account, a Spark HDInsight cluster to apply transformations, an Interactive Query HDInsight cluster for quick querying and business insight visualization on Power BI. 

### Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

Download [Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45331) to visualize business insights at the end of this tutorial. 

#### Sign into Azure

Through the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell from the top menu bar. Log into your Azure account and set the subscription. Set up the resource group for the project. 

#### Set relevant variables for easy use
Pick a unique resource group name. 

```azurecli-interactive 
resourceGroup="<RESOURCE GROUP NAME>"
subscriptionID="<SUBSCRIPTION ID>" 

az login
az account set --subscription $subscriptionID
az group create --name $resourceGroup --location westus
```
#### Download relevant files for this project

Clone this [git hub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-sales-insights-etl) and `cd` into the folder.  

- `/salesdata/`
- `resourcestemplate.json`, `resourcesparameters.json`
- `adftemplate.json`, `adfparameters.json`
- `sparktransform.py` 
- `adlsgen2script.sh`

Navigate to this directory on your Azure CLI. 

## Deploy Azure resources needed for the pipeline 

This section will deploy the following resources: 
1. Azure Blob Storage - to mimic your company's storage of raw data
2. ADLS Gen2 Storage - the storage account for both HDInsight clusters. Read more about HDInsight and ADLS Gen 2 storage [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-hdinsight-integration-with-data-lake-storage-gen-2-preview-acl-and-security-update/).
3. Managed Identity - to give clusters access to the storage account
4. Spark Cluster - to clean up and transform the raw data
5. Interactive Query Cluster - to allow quick querying and data visualization on Power BI
6. VNET supported by NSG rules - to provide security to your clusters 

### Deploy the Resource Manager Template

The `resourcestemplate.json` Resource Manager Template configures all the above resources. The default password used for ssh access to the clusters is `Thisisapassword1`. If you'd like to change the password navigate to `resourcesparameters.json` file and change the password for the `sparksshPassword`, `sparkClusterLoginPassword`, `llapClusterLoginPassword`, `llapsshPassword` parameters. 

```azurecli-interactive 
az group deployment create --name ResourcesDeployment \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --template-file resourcestemplate.json \
    --parameters "@resourceparameters.json"
```
Note: Cluster creation can take around 20 minutes. 

If you'd like to check on the status of your deployment, navigate to the resource group on the Azure portal and look where it says `Deployments` and click the link. Then select the name of your deployment. Here you can see the resources that have successfully deployed and those that are still being worked on.
 
#### Upload the sales data files by executing the command 

```
az storage blob upload-batch -d rawdata \
    --account-name <BLOB STORAGE NAME> -s ./ --pattern *.csv
```
This blob storage account will mimic the company's own data storage. 

To verify this step worked correctly, go to the resource group on the azure portal and check all the outlined resources were deployed. You can also check that the data is uploaded to the Blob Storage account. 

## Create an Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Factory is a tool that helps automate Azure Pipelines. It's not the only way to accomplish these tasks, but it's a great way to automate these processes. Read more about it [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/). 

This Azure Data Factory will have two pipelines: 

1. The first pipeline will copy the data from the Azure Blob Storage to the ADLS Gen 2 Storage Account to mimic data ingestion. 
2. The second pipeline will transform the data in the Spark cluster. The script transforms the data by removing unwanted columns as well as appending a new column that calculates the revenue generated by a single transaction.
   

In `sparktransform.py`, fill in the ADLS Gen2 storage account name within the angle brackets. 

In `adfparameters.json` fill out the values of the account keys of both the blob and ADLS Gen2 storage accounts. The keys can be found by navigating to them on the portal and selecting `account keys` or by using the following command for both the blob and the ADLS Gen2 storage account

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account keys list \
    --account-name <STORAGE NAME> \
    --resource-group $rg \
    --output table
```

In `adlsgen2script.sh` fill in your subscription id, resource group name, and ADLS Gen2 Storage Account Name in the angle brackets. Then run the script. This creates a service principal with  Storage Blob Data Contributor permissions on the ADLS Gen2 storage account. It then obtains an authentication token to authorize POST requests to the [ADLS Gen2 FileSystem REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/datalakestoragegen2/filesystem/create)

```
./adlsgen2script.sh
```
Deploy the ADF using the following command: 

```azurecli-interactive 
az group deployment create --name ADFDeployment \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --template-file adftemplate.json \
    --parameters "@adfparameters.json"
```

### Trigger the Pipelines
To trigger the pipelines you can either:
1.  Run the following commands to trigger the ADF pipelines in PowerShell mode. 

This pipeline moves the data from blob storage to ADLS Gen2 Storage
```powershell
Invoke-AzDataFactoryV2Pipeline -DataFactory $df -PipelineName "CopyPipeline_k8z" 
```
This pipeline applies the spark transformations on the data and may take a few minutes. 
```powershell
Invoke-AzDataFactoryV2Pipeline -DataFactory $df -PipelineName "sparkTransformPipeline"
```
2. You can also open the Data Factory, select Author & Monitor, and trigger the copy pipeline, then the spark pipeline from the portal. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-adf#trigger-a-pipeline) is a tutorial that shows you how to trigger pipelines from the portal. 

To verify that the pipelines executed you can either 
1. Navigate to the monitor section on ADF through the portal. 
2. Go to your ADLS Gen 2 storage account storage explorer, go to the `files` FileSystem, and navigate to the `transformed` folder and check its contents to see if the pipeline succeeded.

For other ways to transform data using HDInsight check out this article on using [Jupyter notebook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-load-data-run-query)

## Create a table on the Interactive Query cluster to view data on Power BI

Now, SSH into the LLAP cluster using the following command and then enter your password. If you have not altered the `resourcesparameters.json` file this should be `Thisisapassword1`. 

```
ssh sshuser@<clustername>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
```

Next, create a file that will contain the Hive query to create a table. 
```
nano query.hql
```
Copy the contents below into `query.hql` and substitute your storage account name in the angle brackets. 
```
DROP TABLE sales_raw;
-- Creates an external table over the csv file
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE sales_raw(
  REGION STRING,
  STORE STRING,
  SALEDATE STRING,
  DEP STRING,
  ITEM STRING,
  UNITSOLD INT,
  UNITPRICE INT,
  REVENUE INT,
  CUSTOMERID INT, 
  LOYALTY BOOLEAN, 
  FIRSTPURCHASE STRING,
  FREQ INT)
--Format and location of the file
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION 'abfs://files@<ADLS GEN2 STORAGE NAME>.dfs.core.windows.net/transformed';
--Drop table sales if exists
DROP TABLE sales;
--Create sales table and populate with data\
--pulled in from csv file (via external table defined previously)
CREATE TABLE sales AS
SELECT REGION AS region,
	STORE as store,
	CAST(SALEDATE as DATE) as saledate, 
	DEP as dep,
	ITEM as item,
	UNITSOLD as unitsold,
	UNITPRICE as unitprice,
	REVENUE as revenue,
	CUSTOMERID as customerID,
	LOYALTY as loyalty,
	FIRSTPURCHASE as firstpurchase,
	FREQ as freq
FROM sales_raw;
```
Run the following command to execute the script
```
beeline -u 'jdbc:hive2://localhost:10001/;transportMode=http' -f query.hql
```

This script will create a table on the Interactive Query cluster that you can access from Power BI. 

Open up Power BI Desktop and select Get Data. Search for HDInsight Interactive Query cluster and paste the URI for your cluster there. It should be in the format `https://<LLAP CLUSTER NAME>.azurehdinsight.net` Type `default` for the database. 

Once the data is loaded, you can experiment with the dashboard you would like to create. Here is an example dashboard with the given data.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete all resources with the following steps so that you are not charged for them. 

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete -n $resourceGroup
```
