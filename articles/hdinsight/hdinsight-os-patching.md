# Configure the OS patching schedule for Linux-based HDInsight clusters 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ubuntu images become available for new HDInsight cluster creation within three months of being published. As of January 2019, running clusters aren't auto-patched. Customers must use script actions or other mechanisms to patch a running cluster. Newly created clusters will always include the latest available updates, including the most recent security patches.

## How to configure the OS patching schedule
The virtual machines (VMs) in an HDInsight cluster must be restarted on occasion to install important security patches.

Using the script actions described in this article, you can modify the OS patching schedule by doing the following steps:

1. Install all updates, only kernel + security updates, or only kernel updates.
2. Do an immediate restart, or schedule a restart on the VM.

> [!NOTE]  
> These script actions will work only with Linux-based HDInsight clusters created after August 1, 2016. Patches will be effective only when VMs are restarted.
> These scripts will not automatically apply updates for all future update cycles. Run the scripts each time new updates must be applied to install the updates and restart the VM.

## How to use the script

Using this script requires the following information:
1. The install-updates-schedule-restarts script location: https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxospatchingrestartconfigv02/install-updates-schedule-restarts.sh.
 	
   HDInsight uses this URI to find and run the script on all the VMs in the cluster. This script provides options to install updates and restart the VM.
  
2. The schedule-restarts script location: https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxospatchingrestartconfigv02/schedule-restarts.sh.
 	
   HDInsight uses this URI to find and run the script on all the VMs in the cluster. This script restarts the VM.
  
3. The cluster node types that the script is applied to includes headnode, workernode, and zookeeper. This script must be applied to all node types in the cluster. If it isn't applied to a node type, then the VMs for that node type will not be updated or restarted.

4. Parameter: The install-updates-schedule-restarts script accepts two numeric parameters:

    | Parameter | Definition |
    | --- | --- |
    | Install kernel updates only/Install all updates/Install kernel + security updates only |0,  1, or 2. A value of 0 installs kernel updates only, while 1 installs all updates, and 2 installs kernel + security updates only. If no parameter is provided, the default is 0. |
    | No restart/Enable schedule restart/Enables immediate restart |0, 1, or 2. A value of 0 disables restart, while 1 enables schedule restart and 2 enables immediate restart. If no parameter is given, the default is 0. The user must input parameter 1 to input parameter 2. |
   
 5. Parameter: The schedule-restarts script accepts one numeric parameter:

    | Parameter | Definition |
    | --- | --- |
    | Enable schedule restart/Enable immediate restart |1 or 2. A value of 1 enables schedule restart (this restart is scheduled in 12-24 hours) while 2 enables immediate restart (in 5 minutes). If no parameter is given, the default is 1. |  

> [!NOTE]
> You must mark the script as persisted when applying to an existing cluster. Otherwise, any new nodes created through scaling operations will use the default patching schedule.  If you apply the script as part of the cluster creation process, it's persisted automatically.
