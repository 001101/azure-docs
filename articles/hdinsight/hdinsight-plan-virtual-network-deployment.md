# Plan a virtual network deployment for Azure HDInsight clusters

Learn how to use HDInsight with an [Azure Virtual Network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). Using an Azure Virtual Network enables the following scenarios:

* Connecting to HDInsight directly from an on-premises network.

* Connecting HDInsight to data stores in an Azure Virtual network.

* Directly accessing [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) services that are not available publicly over the internet. For example, [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) APIs or the [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) Java API.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After Feb 28, 2019, the networking resources (such as NICs, LBs, etc) for NEW clusters created in a VNET will be provisioned in the same HDInsight cluster resource group. Previously, these resources were provisioned in the VNET resource group. There is no change to the current running clusters and those clusters created without a VNET.

## Planning

The following are the questions that you must answer when planning to install HDInsight in a virtual network:

* Do you need to install HDInsight into an existing virtual network? Or are you creating a new network?

    If you are using an existing virtual network, you may need to modify the network configuration before you can install HDInsight. For more information, see the [add HDInsight to an existing virtual network](#existingvnet) section.

* Do you want to connect the virtual network containing HDInsight to another virtual network or your on-premises network?

    To easily work with resources across networks, you may need to create a custom DNS and configure DNS forwarding. For more information, see the [connecting multiple networks](#multinet) section.

* Do you want to restrict/redirect inbound or outbound traffic to HDInsight?

    HDInsight must have unrestricted communication with specific IP addresses in the Azure data center. There are also several ports that must be allowed through firewalls for client communication. For more information, see the [controlling network traffic](#networktraffic) section.

## <a id="existingvnet"></a>Add HDInsight to an existing virtual network

Use the steps in this section to discover how to add a new HDInsight to an existing Azure Virtual Network.

> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot add an existing HDInsight cluster into a virtual network.

1. Are you using a classic or Resource Manager deployment model for the virtual network?

    HDInsight 3.4 and greater requires a Resource Manager virtual network. Earlier versions of HDInsight required a classic virtual network.

    If your existing network is a classic virtual network, then you must create a Resource Manager virtual network and then connect the two. [Connecting classic VNets to new VNets](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-connect-different-deployment-models-portal.md).

    Once joined, HDInsight installed in the Resource Manager network can interact with resources in the classic network.

2. Do you use forced tunneling? Forced tunneling is a subnet setting that forces outbound Internet traffic to a device for inspection and logging. HDInsight does not support forced tunneling. Either remove forced tunneling before deploying HDInsight into an existing subnet, or create a new subnet with no forced tunneling for HDInsight.

3. Do you use network security groups, user-defined routes, or Virtual Network Appliances to restrict traffic into or out of the virtual network?

    As a managed service, HDInsight requires unrestricted access to several IP addresses in the Azure data center. To allow communication with these IP addresses, update any existing network security groups or user-defined routes.
    
    HDInsight  hosts multiple services, which use a variety of ports. Do not block traffic to these ports. For a list of ports to allow through virtual appliance firewalls, see the Security section.
    
    To find your existing security configuration, use the following Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI commands:

    * Network security groups

        Replace `RESOURCEGROUP` with the name of the resource group that contains the virtual network, and then enter the command:
    
        ```powershell
        Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName  "RESOURCEGROUP"
        ```
    
        ```azurecli
        az network nsg list --resource-group RESOURCEGROUP
        ```

        For more information, see the [Troubleshoot network security groups](../virtual-network/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem.md) document.

        > [!IMPORTANT]  
        > Network security group rules are applied in order based on rule priority. The first rule that matches the traffic pattern is applied, and no others are applied for that traffic. Order rules from most permissive to least permissive. For more information, see the [Filter network traffic with network security groups](../virtual-network/security-overview.md) document.

    * User-defined routes

        Replace `RESOURCEGROUP` with the name of the resource group that contains the virtual network, and then enter the command:

        ```powershell
        Get-AzRouteTable -ResourceGroupName "RESOURCEGROUP"
        ```

        ```azurecli
        az network route-table list --resource-group RESOURCEGROUP
        ```

        For more information, see the [Troubleshoot routes](../virtual-network/diagnose-network-routing-problem.md) document.

4. Create an HDInsight cluster and select the Azure Virtual Network during configuration. Use the steps in the following documents to understand the cluster creation process:

    * [Create HDInsight using the Azure portal](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md)
    * [Create HDInsight using Azure PowerShell](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-azure-powershell.md)
    * [Create HDInsight using Azure Classic CLI](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-azure-cli.md)
    * [Create HDInsight using an Azure Resource Manager template](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-arm-templates.md)

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > Adding HDInsight to a virtual network is an optional configuration step. Be sure to select the virtual network when configuring the cluster.

## <a id="multinet"></a>Connecting multiple networks

The biggest challenge with a multi-network configuration is name resolution between the networks.

Azure provides name resolution for Azure services that are installed in a virtual network. This built-in name resolution allows HDInsight to connect to the following resources by using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN):

* Any resource that is available on the internet. For example, microsoft.com, windowsupdate.com.

* Any resource that is in the same Azure Virtual Network, by using the __internal DNS name__ of the resource. For example, when using the default name resolution, the following are example internal DNS names assigned to HDInsight worker nodes:

  * wn0-hdinsi.0owcbllr5hze3hxdja3mqlrhhe.ex.internal.cloudapp.net
  * wn2-hdinsi.0owcbllr5hze3hxdja3mqlrhhe.ex.internal.cloudapp.net

    Both these nodes can communicate directly with each other, and other nodes in HDInsight, by using internal DNS names.

The default name resolution does __not__ allow HDInsight to resolve the names of resources in networks that are joined to the virtual network. For example, it is common to join your on-premises network to the virtual network. With only the default name resolution, HDInsight cannot access resources in the on-premises network by name. The opposite is also true, resources in your on-premises network cannot access resources in the virtual network by name.

> [!WARNING]  
> You must create the custom DNS server and configure the virtual network to use it before creating the HDInsight cluster.

To enable name resolution between the virtual network and resources in joined networks, you must perform the following actions:

1. Create a custom DNS server in the Azure Virtual Network where you plan to install HDInsight.

2. Configure the virtual network to use the custom DNS server.

3. Find the Azure assigned DNS suffix for your virtual network. This value is similar to `0owcbllr5hze3hxdja3mqlrhhe.ex.internal.cloudapp.net`. For information on finding the DNS suffix, see the [Example: Custom DNS](#example-dns) section.

4. Configure forwarding between the DNS servers. The configuration depends on the type of remote network.

   * If the remote network is an on-premises network, configure DNS as follows:
        
     * __Custom DNS__ (in the virtual network):

         * Forward requests for the DNS suffix of the virtual network to the Azure recursive resolver (168.63.129.16). Azure handles requests for resources in the virtual network

         * Forward all other requests to the on-premises DNS server. The on-premises DNS handles all other name resolution requests, even requests for internet resources such as Microsoft.com.

     * __On-premises DNS__: Forward requests for the virtual network DNS suffix to the custom DNS server. The custom DNS server then forwards to the Azure recursive resolver.

       This configuration routes requests for fully qualified domain names that contain the DNS suffix of the virtual network to the custom DNS server. All other requests (even for public internet addresses) are handled by the on-premises DNS server.

   * If the remote network is another Azure Virtual Network, configure DNS as follows:

     * __Custom DNS__ (in each virtual network):

         * Requests for the DNS suffix of the virtual networks are forwarded to the custom DNS servers. The DNS in each virtual network is responsible for resolving resources within its network.

         * Forward all other requests to the Azure recursive resolver. The recursive resolver is responsible for resolving local and internet resources.

       The DNS server for each network forwards requests to the other, based on DNS suffix. Other requests are resolved using the Azure recursive resolver.

     For an example of each configuration, see the [Example: Custom DNS](#example-dns) section.

For more information, see the [Name Resolution for VMs and Role Instances](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md) document.

## Directly connect to Apache Hadoop services

You can connect to the cluster at `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net`. This address uses a public IP, which may not be reachable if you have used NSGs to restrict incoming traffic from the internet. Additionally, when you deploy the cluster in a VNet you can access it using the private endpoint `https://CLUSTERNAME-int.azurehdinsight.net`. This endpoint resolves to a private IP inside the VNet for cluster access.

To connect to Apache Ambari and other web pages through the virtual network, use the following steps:

1. To discover the internal fully qualified domain names (FQDN) of the HDInsight cluster nodes, use one of the following methods:

    Replace `RESOURCEGROUP` with the name of the resource group that contains the virtual network, and then enter the command:

	```powershell
	$clusterNICs = Get-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName "RESOURCEGROUP" | where-object {$_.Name -like "*node*"}

	$nodes = @()
	foreach($nic in $clusterNICs) {
		$node = new-object System.Object
		$node | add-member -MemberType NoteProperty -name "Type" -value $nic.Name.Split('-')[1]
		$node | add-member -MemberType NoteProperty -name "InternalIP" -value $nic.IpConfigurations.PrivateIpAddress
		$node | add-member -MemberType NoteProperty -name "InternalFQDN" -value $nic.DnsSettings.InternalFqdn
		$nodes += $node
	}
	$nodes | sort-object Type
    ```

	```azurecli
	az network nic list --resource-group RESOURCEGROUP --output table --query "[?contains(name,'node')].{NICname:name,InternalIP:ipConfigurations[0].privateIpAddress,InternalFQDN:dnsSettings.internalFqdn}"
    ```

    In the list of nodes returned, find the FQDN for the head nodes and use the FQDNs to connect to Ambari and other web services. For example, use `http://<headnode-fqdn>:8080` to access Ambari.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > Some services hosted on the head nodes are only active on one node at a time. If you try accessing a service on one head node and it returns a 404 error, switch to the other head node.

2. To determine the node and port that a service is available on, see the [Ports used by Hadoop services on HDInsight](./hdinsight-hadoop-port-settings-for-services.md) document.

## <a id="networktraffic"></a> Controlling network traffic

### Controlling inbound traffic to HDInsight clusters

Network traffic in an Azure Virtual Networks can be controlled using the following methods:

* **Network security groups** (NSG) allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to the network. For more information, see the [Filter network traffic with network security groups](../virtual-network/security-overview.md) document.

* **Network virtual appliances** replicate the functionality of devices such as firewalls and routers. For more information, see the [Network Appliances](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/network-appliances) document.

As a managed service, HDInsight requires unrestricted access to the HDInsight health and management services both for incoming and outgoing traffic from the VNET. When using NSGs, you must ensure that these services can still communicate with HDInsight cluster.

![Diagram of HDInsight entities created in Azure custom VNET](./media/hdinsight-virtual-network-architecture/vnet-diagram.png)

### HDInsight with network security groups

If you plan on using **network security groups** to control network traffic, perform the following actions before installing HDInsight:

1. Identify the Azure region that you plan to use for HDInsight.

2. Identify the IP addresses required by HDInsight. For more information, see the [IP Addresses required by HDInsight](#hdinsight-ip) section.

3. Create or modify the network security groups for the subnet that you plan to install HDInsight into.

    * __Network security groups__: allow __inbound__ traffic on port __443__ from the IP addresses. This will ensure that HDInsight management services can reach the cluster from outside the virtual network.

For more information on network security groups, see the [overview of network security groups](../virtual-network/security-overview.md).

### Controlling outbound traffic from HDInsight clusters

For more information on controlling outbound traffic from HDInsight clusters, see [Configure outbound network traffic restriction for Azure HDInsight clusters](hdinsight-restrict-outbound-traffic.md).

#### Forced tunneling to on-premise

Forced tunneling is a user-defined routing configuration where all traffic from a subnet is forced to a specific network or location, such as your on-premises network. HDInsight does __not__ support forced tunneling of traffic to on-premises networks. 

## <a id="hdinsight-ip"></a> Required IP addresses

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Azure health and management services must be able to communicate with HDInsight. If you use network security groups or user-defined routes, allow traffic from the IP addresses for these services to reach HDInsight.
>
> If you do not use network security groups or user-defined routes to control traffic, you can ignore this section.

If you use network security groups, you must allow traffic from the Azure health and management services to reach HDInsight clusters on port 443. You must also allow traffic between VMs inside the subnet. Use the following steps to find the IP addresses that must be allowed:

1. You must always allow traffic from the following IP addresses:

    | Source IP address | Destination  | Direction |
    | ---- | ----- | ----- |
    | 168.61.49.99 | \*:443 | Inbound |
    | 23.99.5.239 | \*:443 | Inbound |
    | 168.61.48.131 | \*:443 | Inbound |
    | 138.91.141.162 | \*:443 | Inbound |

2. If your HDInsight cluster is in one of the following regions, then you must allow traffic from the IP addresses listed for the region:

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If the Azure region you are using is not listed, then only use the four IP addresses from step 1.

    | Country | Region | Allowed Source IP addresses | Allowed Destination | Direction |

    For information on the IP addresses to use for Azure Government, see the [Azure Government Intelligence + Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-services-intelligenceandanalytics) document.

3. You must also allow access from __168.63.129.16__. This address is Azure's recursive resolver. For more information, see the [Name resolution for VMs and Role instances](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md) document.

For more information, see the [Controlling network traffic](#networktraffic) section.

If you are using user-defined routes(UDRs), you should specify a route and allow outbound traffic from the VNET to the above IPs with the next hop set to "Internet".
    
## <a id="hdinsight-ports"></a> Required ports

If you plan on using a **firewall** and access the cluster from outside on certain ports, you might need to allow traffic on those ports needed for your scenario. By default, no special whitelisting of ports is needed as long as the azure management traffic explained in the previous section is allowed to reach cluster on port 443.

For a list of ports for specific services, see the [Ports used by Apache Hadoop services on HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-port-settings-for-services.md) document.

For more information on firewall rules for virtual appliances, see the [virtual appliance scenario](../virtual-network/virtual-network-scenario-udr-gw-nva.md) document.
