# Migrate on-premises Hadoop clusters to Azure HDInsight

This article is a best-practices guide for migrating on-premises Apache Hadoop eco-system deployments to Azure HDInsight. It describes the migration process and provides guidance on rearchitecting the on-premises Hadoop system to take advantage of the benefits of Azure HDInsight that is optimized for cloud computing. It also discusses questions designed to gather information critical to the success of the migration.

The following process is recommended for planning a migration of on-premises Hadoop clusters to Azure HDInsight:

1. Understand the current on-premises deployment and topologies.
2. Understand the current project scope, timelines, and team expertise.
3. Understand the Azure requirements.
4. Build out a detailed plan, together with best practices.

The main sections of the paper focus on migration best practices and processes. The questionnaires that capture information about the on-premises deployment and migration requirements are included in the appendix.

## Audience and scope

This guide is for people who are responsible for the design, deployment, and migration of Apache Hadoop solutions in Azure HDInsight. The roles that may benefit from this article include cloud architects, Hadoop administrators, and DevOps engineers. Software developers, data engineers, and data scientists should also benefit from the explanation of how different types of clusters work in the cloud.

## Why to migrate to Azure HDInsight

Azure HDInsight is a cloud distribution of the Hadoop components from the [Hortonworks Data Platform(HDP)](https://hortonworks.com/products/data-center/hdp/). Azure HDInsight makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. HDInsight includes the most popular open-source frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache LLAP, Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, Apache HBase, and R.

## Advantages that Azure HDInsight offers over on-premises Hadoop

- **Low cost** - Costs can be reduced by [creating clusters on demand](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-adf.md) and paying only for what you use. Decoupled compute and storage provides flexibility keep the data volume independent of the cluster size.
- **Automated cluster creation** - Automated cluster creation requires minimal setup and configuration. Automation can be used for on-demand clusters.
- **Managed hardware and configuration** - There's no need to worry about the physical hardware or infrastructure with an HDInsight cluster. Just specify the configuration of the cluster, and Azure sets it up.
- **Easily Scalable** - HDInsight enables you to [scale](../hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux.md) workloads up or down. Azure takes care of data redistribution and workload rebalancing without interrupting the jobs.
- **Global availability** -  HDInsight is available in more [regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/)than any other big data analytics offering. Azure HDInsight is also available in Azure Government, China, and Germany, which allows you to meet your enterprise needs in key sovereign areas.
- **Secure and compliant** - HDInsight enables you to protect your enterprise data assets with [Azure Virtual Network](../hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network.md), [encryption](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-with-secure-transfer-storage.md), and integration with [Azure Active Directory](../domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-introduction.md).
HDInsight also meets the most popular industry and government [compliance standards](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/trusted-cloud).
- **Simplified version management** - Azure HDInsight manages the version of Hadoop eco-system components and keeps them up-to-date. Software updates are usually a complex process for on-premises deployments.
- **Smaller clusters optimized for specific workloads with fewer dependencies between components** -  A typical on-premises Hadoop setup uses a single cluster that serves many purposes. With Azure HDInsight, workload-specific clusters can be created. Creating clusters for specific workloads removes the complexity of maintaining a single cluster with growing complexity.
- **Productivity** - You can use various tools for Hadoop and Spark in your preferred development environment.
- **Extensibility with custom tools or third-party Applications** - HDInsight clusters can be extended with installed components and can also be integrated with the other big data solutions by using [one-click](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/partner-ecosystem/) deployments from the Azure Market place.
- **Easy Management, Administration, and Monitoring** - Azure HDInsight integrates with [Azure Log Analytics](../hdinsight-hadoop-oms-log-analytics-tutorial.md) to provide a single interface with which you can monitor all your clusters.
- **Integration with other Azure services** - HDInsight can easily be integrated with other popular Azure services such as Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Blob, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Analysis Services.
- **Self-healing processes and components** - HDInsight constantly checks the infrastructure and open-source components using its own monitoring infrastructure. It also automatically recovers critical failures such as unavailability of open-source components and nodes. Alerts are triggered in Ambari if any OSS component is failed.

For more information, see the article [What is Azure HDInsight and the Hadoop technology stack](../hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction.md).

## Proposed Azure HDInsight architecture and migration best practices

A typical on-premises Hadoop infrastructure consists of a single large cluster that supports many workloads. This single cluster is often complex and may require compromises to the individual services to make everything work together. Migrating to Azure HDInsight requires a change in approach.

The following sections present some recommendations for an Azure HDInsight architecture.

### Use multiple workload-optimized clusters rather than using a single large cluster

Azure HDInsight clusters are designed for a specific type of compute usage. Because storage can be shared across multiple clusters, it is a good practice to create multiple workload-optimized compute clusters to meet the needs of different jobs. Each cluster type is tuned with the optimized configuration for the best performance for specific workloads. The following table lists the supported cluster types in HDInsight and the corresponding workloads.

|**Workload**|**HDInsight Cluster type**|
|---|---|
|Batch processing (ETL / ELT)|Hadoop, Spark|
|Data warehousing|Hadoop, Spark, Interactive Query|
|IoT / Streaming|Kafka, Storm, Spark|
|NoSQL Transactional processing|HBase|
|Interactive and Faster queries with in-memory caching|Interactive Query|
|Data Science|ML Services, Spark|

The following table shows the different methods that can be used to create HDInsight cluster.

|**Tool**|**Browser based**|**Command Line**|**REST API**|**SDK**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|[Azure portal](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md)|X||||
|[Azure Data Factory](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-adf.md)|X|X|X|X|
|[Azure CLI (ver 1.0)](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-azure-cli.md)||X|||

|Java SDK||||X|
|[Azure Resource Manager templates](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-arm-templates.md)||X|||

For more information, see the article [Cluster types in HDInsight](../hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction.md)

### Use transient on-demand clusters

Many HDInsight clusters may go unused for long periods of time. To help save on resource costs, HDInsight supports on-demand transient clusters, which can be deleted once the workload has been successfully completed.

When you delete a cluster, the associated storage account and external metadata are not removed. The cluster can later be re-created using the same storage accounts and meta-stores.

Azure Data Factory can be used to schedule creation of on-demand HDInsight clusters.

For more information, see the article [Create on-demand Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using Azure Data Factory](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-adf.md)

### Decouple storage from compute

Typical on-premises Hadoop deployments colocate storage and compute. Because they are linked, compute and storage must be scaled together. The cluster must also be to access the data.

On HDInsight clusters, storage does not need to be colocated with compute and can either be in Azure storage, Azure Data Lake Storage or both. Decoupling storage from compute has the following benefits.

- Data sharing across clusters
- Use of transient clusters since the data isn't dependent on cluster
- Reduced storage cost
- Scaling storage and compute separately
- Data replication across Regions

Compute clusters are created close to storage account resources in the Azure region to mitigate performance cost of not colocating compute and storage. High-speed networks make it efficient for the compute nodes to access the data inside Azure storage.

### Choose the right storage system for HDInsight clusters

The on-premises Hadoop File System (HDFS) directory structure can be re-created on one Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage. You can then safely delete HDInsight clusters that are used for computation without losing user data. They can be used as both the default file system and an additional file system. The HDInsight cluster and the storage account must be hosted in the same region.

#### Azure storage

HDInsight clusters can use the blob container in Azure Storage as either the default file system or an additional file system. The Standard tier storage account is supported for use with HDInsight clusters. The Premier tier is not supported. The default Blob container stores cluster-specific information such as job history and logs. Sharing one blob container as the default file system for multiple clusters is not supported.

The storage accounts that are defined in the creation process and their respective keys are stored in `%HADOOP_HOME%/conf/core-site.xml` on the cluster nodes. They can also be accessed under the "custom core site"
section in HDFS configuration in the Ambari UI. The storage account key is encrypted by default and a custom decryption script is used to decrypt the keys before being passed on to Hadoop daemons. The jobs including Hive, MapReduce, Hadoop streaming, and Pig, carry a description of storage accounts and metadata with them.

Azure storage can be geo-replicated. Although geo-replication gives geographic recovery and data redundancy, a failover to the geo-replicated location severely impacts the performance, and it may incur additional costs. The recommendation is to choose the geo-replication wisely and only if the value of the data is worth the additional cost.

One of the following formats can be used to access data that is stored in Azure Storage

- `wasb:///`: Access default storage using unencrypted communication.
- `wasbs:///`: Access default storage using encrypted communication.
- `wasb://<container-name>@<account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/`:    Used when communicating with a non-default storage account. 

[Azure Storage Scalability and Performance Targets](../../storage/common/storage-scalability-targets.md) lists the current limits on the Azure storage accounts. If the needs of the application exceed the scalability targets of a single storage account, the application can be built to use multiple storage accounts and then partition data objects across those storage accounts.

[Azure Storage Analytics](../../storage/storage-analytics.md) provides metrics for all storage services and Azure portal can be configured collect metrics to be visualized through charts. Alerts can be created to notify when thresholds have been reached for storage resource metrics.

Azure Storage offers [soft delete for blob objects](../../storage/blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete.md) so as to easily recover data when it is erroneously modified or deleted by an application or other storage account user.

The [snapshot](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/creating-a-snapshot-of-a-blob) of a blob can be created. A snapshot is a read-only version of a blob that's taken at a point in time. Once a snapshot has been created, it can be read, copied, or deleted, but not modified. Snapshots provide a way to back up a blob as it appears at a moment in time.

> [!Note]
> For older version of on-premises on-premises Hadoop Distributions that does not have the "wasbs" certificate, it needs to be imported to the Java trust store. The following commands can be used to import certificates into the Java trust store:

- Download the Azure Blob ssl cert to a file

```bash
echo -n | openssl s_client -connect <storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > Azure_Storage.cer
```

- Import the above file to the Java trust store on all the nodes

```bash
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore /path/to/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -alias blobtrust -file Azure_Storage.cer
```

- Verify that the added cert is in the trust store

`keytool -list -v -keystore /path/to/jre/lib/security/cacerts`

#### Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1

Azure Data Lake Storage implements HDFS and POSIX style access control model. It provides first class integration with AAD for fine grained access control. There are no limits to the size of data that it can store, or its ability to run massively parallel analytics.

The following formats can be used to access data that is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen1

- `adl:///`: Access the default Data Lake Store for the cluster.
- `adl://<storage-name>.azuredatalakestore.net/`: Used when communicating with a non-default Data Lake Store.

When HDInsight is deployed with Data Lake Store as default storage, the cluster-related files are stored in Data Lake Store in the following location:
- `adl://mydatalakestore/<cluster_root_path>` where `<cluster_root_path>` is the name of a folder you create in Data Lake Store. By specifying a root path for each cluster, the same Data Lake Store account can be used for more than one cluster.

To be able to use a Data Lake Store as default storage, an Azure Active directory service principal must be granted with access to the following paths:

- The Data Lake Store account root. For example: `adl://mydatalakestore/`
- The folder for all cluster folders. For example: `adl://mydatalakestore/clusters`
- The folder for the cluster. For example: `adl://mydatalakestore/clusters/cluster1storage`

Only an Azure AD administrator can create an AAD service principal. The service principal must be created with a certificate. More than one Data Lake Store accounts could be added to an HDInsight cluster by giving permission to the service principal to the Data Lake Store accounts.

> [!Note]
> Adding Azure Data Lake Storage as **additional** storage to an **existing** HDInsight cluster is not a supported scenario.

ADLS Gen1 is currently available in the following Regions

- East US 2
- Central US
- North Europe
- West Europe

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Create HDInsight clusters with Data Lake Store by using the Azure portal](../../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal.md)
- [Use Data Lake Store with Azure HDInsight clusters](../hdinsight-hadoop-use-data-lake-store.md)

#### Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (preview)

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the latest storage offering and is in Preview at the time of writing of this paper. It unifies the core capabilities from the first generation of Azure Data Lake Storage with a Hadoop compatible file system endpoint directly integrated into Azure Blob Storage. This enhancement combines the scale and cost benefits of object storage with the reliability and performance typically associated only with on-premises file systems.

ADLS Gen 2 is built on top of [Azure Blob storage](../../storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction.md) and allows you to interface with data using both file system and object storage paradigms. Features from [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](../../data-lake-store/index.md), such as file system semantics, file-level security, and scale are combined with low-cost, tiered storage, high availability/disaster recovery capabilities, and a large SDK/tooling ecosystem from [Azure Blob storage](../../storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction.md). In Data Lake Storage Gen2, all the qualities of object storage remain while adding the advantages of a file system interface optimized for analytics workloads.

A fundamental feature of Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the addition of a [hierarchical namespace](../../storage/data-lake-storage/namespace.md) to the Blob storage service, which organizes objects/files into a hierarchy of directories for performant data access. The hierarchical structure enables operations such as renaming or deleting a directory to be single atomic metadata operations on the directory rather than enumerating and processing all objects that share the name prefix of the directory.

In the past, cloud-based analytics had to compromise in areas of performance, management, and security. The Key features of Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 are as follows:

- **Hadoop compatible access**: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 allows you to manage and access data just as you would with a [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html). The new [ABFS driver](../../storage/data-lake-storage/abfs-driver.md) is available within all Apache Hadoop environments that are included in [Azure HDInsight](../index.yml). This driver allows you to access data stored in Data Lake Storage Gen2.

- **A superset of POSIX permissions**: The security model for Data Lake Gen2 fully supports ACL and POSIX permissions along with some extra granularity specific to Data Lake Storage Gen2. Settings may be configured through admin tools or through frameworks like Hive and Spark.

- **Cost effective**: Data Lake Storage Gen2 features low-cost storage capacity and transactions. As data transitions through its complete life-cycle, billing rates change to minimize costs via built-in features such as [Azure Blob storage life cycle](../../storage/common/storage-lifecycle-managment-concepts.md).

- **Works with Blob storage tools, frameworks, and apps**: Data Lake Storage Gen2 continues to work with a wide array of tools, frameworks, and applications that exist today for Blob storage.

- **Optimized driver**: The Azure Blob Filesystem driver (ABFS) is [optimized specifically](../../storage/data-lake-storage/abfs-driver.md) for big data analytics. The corresponding REST APIs are surfaced through the dfs endpoint, dfs.core.windows.net.

One of the following formats can be used to access data that is stored in ADLS Gen2:
- `abfs:///`: Access the default Data Lake Store for the cluster.
- `abfs[s]://file_system@account_name.dfs.core.windows.net`: Used when communicating with a non-default Data Lake Storage.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Introduction to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Preview](../../storage/data-lake-storage/introduction.md)
- [The Azure Blob Filesystem driver (ABFS.md)](../../storage/data-lake-storage/abfs-driver.md)

### Protect Azure Storage key visibility within the on-premises Hadoop cluster configuration

The Azure storage keys that are added to the Hadoop configuration files, establish connectivity between on premises HDFS and Azure Blob storage. These keys can be protected by encrypting them with the Hadoop credential provider framework. Once encrypted, they can be stored and accessed securely.

**To provision the credentials:**

```bash
hadoop credential create fs.azure.account.key.account.blob.core.windows.net -value <storage key> -provider jceks://hdfs@headnode.xx.internal.cloudapp.net/path/to/jceks/file
```

**To add the above provider path to the core-site.xml or to the Ambari configuration under custom core-site:**

```xml
<property>
    <name>hadoop.security.credential.provider.path</name>
        <value>
        jceks://hdfs@headnode.xx.internal.cloudapp.net/path/to/jceks
        </value>
    <description>Path to interrogate for protected credentials.</description>
</property>
```

> [!Note]
> The provider path property can also be added to the distcp command line instead of storing key at cluster level at core-site.xml as follows:

```bash
hadoop distcp -D hadoop.security.credential.provider.path=jceks://hdfs@headnode.xx.internal.cloudapp.net/path/to/jceks /user/user1/ wasb:<//yourcontainer@youraccount.blob.core.windows.net/>user1
```

### Restrict access to Azure storage data using SAS signatures

HDInsight by default has full access to data in the Azure Storage accounts associated with the cluster. Shared Access Signatures (SAS) on the blob container can be used to restrict access to the data, such as provide users with read-only access to the data.

#### Using the SAS token created with python

1. Open the
    [SASToken.py](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-dotnet-python-azure-storage-shared-access-signature/blob/master/Python/SASToken.py) file and change the following values:
    - policy_name: The name to use for the stored policy to create.
    - storage_account_name: The name of your storage account.
    - storage_account_key: The key for the storage account.
    - storage_container_name: The container in the storage account that you want to restrict access to.
    - example_file_path: The path to a file that is uploaded to the container
2. The SASToken.py file comes with the `ContainerPermissions.READ + ContainerPermissions.LIST` permissions and can be adjusted based on the use case.
3. Execute the script as follows: `python SASToken.py`
4. It displays the SAS token similar to the following text when the script completes: `sr=c&si=policyname&sig=dOAi8CXuz5Fm15EjRUu5dHlOzYNtcK3Afp1xqxniEps%3D&sv=2014-02-14`

5. To limit access to a container with Shared Access Signature, add a custom entry to the core-site configuration for the cluster under Ambari HDFS Configs Advanced Custom core-site Add property.
6. Use the following values for the **Key** and **Value** fields:

    **Key**: fs.azure.sas.YOURCONTAINER.YOURACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net
    **Value**: The SAS KEY returned by the Python application FROM step 4 above

7. Click the **Add** button to save this key and value, then click the **Save** button to save the configuration changes. When prompted, add a description of the change ("adding SAS storage access" for example) and then click **Save**.
8. In the Ambari web UI, select HDFS from the list on the left, and then select **Restart All Affected** from the Service Actions drop down list on the right. When prompted, select **Confirm Restart All**.
9. Repeat this process for MapReduce2 and YARN.

There are three important things to remember regarding the use of SAS Tokens in Azure:

1. When SAS tokens are created with "READ + LIST" permissions, users who access the Blob container with that SAS token won't be able to "write and delete" data. Users who access the Blob container with that SAS token and try a write or delete operation, will receive a message like `"This request is not authorized to perform this operation"`.
2. When the SAS tokens are generated with "READ + LIST + WRITE" permissions (to restrict "DELETE" only), the commands like "hadoop fs -put" first write to a "\_COPYING\_" file and then try to rename the file. This maps to a "copy+delete" for WASB. Since the "DELETE" permission was not provided, the "put" would fail. The "\_COPYING\_" operation is a Hadoop feature intended to provide some concurrency control. Currently there is no way to restrict just the "DELETE" operation without affecting "WRITE" operations as well.
3. Unfortunately, the hadoop credential provider and decryption key provider (ShellDecryptionKeyProvider) currently do not work with the SAS tokens and so it currently cannot be protected from visibility.

For more information, see [Use Azure Storage Shared Access Signatures to restrict access to data in HDInsight](../hdinsight-storage-sharedaccesssignature-permissions.md)


### Use data encryption and replication

All data written to Azure Storage is automatically encrypted using [Storage Service Encryption (SSE)](../../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md). The data in the Azure storage account is always replicated for high availability. When you create a storage account, you can choose one of the following replication options:

- [Locally redundant storage (LRS)](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy-lrs.md)
- [Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs.md)
- [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md)
- [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage)
Azure Data Lake Storage provides locally redundant storage (LRS) but you should also copy critical data to another Data Lake Store account in another region with a frequency aligned to the needs of the disaster recovery plan. There are a variety of methods to copy data including [ADLCopy](../../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-copy-data-azure-storage-blob.md), DistCp, [Azure PowerShell](../../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-powershell.md), or [Azure Data Factory](../../data-factory/connector-azure-data-lake-store.md). It is also recommended to enforce access policies for Data Lake Store account to prevent accidental deletion.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Azure storage replication](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md)
- [Disaster guidance for Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)](../../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-disaster-recovery-guidance.md)

### Attach additional Azure storage accounts to the cluster

During the HDInsight creation process, an Azure Storage account or Azure Data Lake storage account is chosen as the default file system. In addition to this default storage account, additional storage accounts can be added from the same Azure subscription or different Azure subscriptions during the cluster creation process or after a cluster has been created.

Additional storage account can be added in one on the following ways:
- Ambari HDFS Config Advanced Custom core-site Add the storage Account Name and key Restarting the services
- Using [Script action](../hdinsight-hadoop-add-storage.md)
    by passing the storage account name and key

> [!Note]
> In valid use-cases, the limits on the Azure storage can be increased via a request made to [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/).

For more information, see the following articles:
- [Add additional storage accounts to HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-add-storage.md)
- [Attach additional Azure storage accounts to the cluster](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ashish/2016/08/25/hdinsight-attach-additional-azure-storage-accounts/)

### Plan well for the capacity needed for HDInsight clusters

The key things to identify for HDInsight cluster capacity planning are:

- **Choose the Region** - The Azure region determines where the cluster is physically provisioned. To minimize the latency of reads and writes, the cluster should be near in the same Region as the Region where data (storage account) is located.
- **Choose storage location and size** - The default storage must be in the same Region as the cluster. For a 48-node cluster, it is recommended to have 4 to 8 storage accounts. Although there may already be sufficient total storage, each storage account provides additional networking bandwidth for the compute nodes. When there are multiple storage accounts, use a random name for each storage account, without a prefix. The purpose of random naming is reducing the chance of storage bottlenecks (throttling) or common-mode failures across all accounts. For better performance, use only one container per storage account.
- **Choose the VM size and type (now supports the G-series)** - Each cluster type has a set of node types, and each node type has specific options for their VM size and type. The VM size and type is determined by CPU processing power, RAM size, and network latency. A simulated workload can be used to determine the optimal VM size and type for each node types.
- **Choose the number of worker nodes** - The initial number of worker nodes can be determined using the simulated workloads. The cluster can be scaled later by adding more worker nodes to meet peak load demands. The cluster can later be scaled back when the additional worker nodes are not required.

For more information, see the article [Capacity planning for HDInsight clusters](../hdinsight-capacity-planning.md)

### Use the recommended virtual machine types for cluster nodes

See [Default node configuration and virtual machine sizes for clusters](../hdinsight-component-versioning.md#default-node-configuration-and-virtual-machine-sizes-for-clusters) for recommended virtual machine types for each type of HDInsight cluster.

### Check the availability of Hadoop components in HDInsight

Each HDInsight version is a cloud distribution of a version of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) and consists of a set of Hadoop eco-system components. See [HDInsight Component Versioning](../hdinsight-component-versioning.md) for details on all HDInsight components and their current versions.

Ambari UI or Ambari REST API could also be used to check the Hadoop components and versions in HDInsight.

Applications or components that were available in On-premises clusters but are not part of the HDInsight clusters can be added on an Edge Node or on a VM in the same VNet as HDI cluster. A third-party Hadoop application that is not available on Azure HDInsight can be installed from the "Applications" option in HDInsight cluster. The custom hadoop applications can be installed on HDInsight cluster using the "script actions". The following table lists some of the common applications and their HDInsight integration options:

|**Application**|**Integration**
|---|---|
|Airflow|IaaS or HDI Edge node
|Alluxio|IaaS  
|Arcadia|IaaS 
|Atlas|None (Only HDP)
|Datameer|HDI Edge node
|Datastax (Cassandra)|IaaS (CosmosDB an alternative on Azure)
|DataTorrent|IaaS 
|Drill|IaaS 
|Ignite|IaaS
|Jethro|IaaS 
|Mapador|IaaS 
|Mongo|IaaS (CosmosDB an alternative on Azure)
|NiFi|IaaS 
|Presto|IaaS or HDI Edge node
|Python 2|PaaS 
|Python 3|PaaS 
|R|PaaS 
|SAS|IaaS 
|Vertica|IaaS (SQLDW an alternative on Azure)
|Tableau|IaaS 
|Waterline|HDI Edge node
|StreamSets|HDI Edge 
|Palantir|IaaS 
|Sailpoint|Iaas 

For more information, see the article [Hadoop components available with different HDInsight versions](../hdinsight-component-versioning.md#hadoop-components-available-with-different-hdinsight-versions)

### Customize HDInsight clusters using script actions

HDInsight provides a configuration method called **script actions**, that invokes custom scripts to customize the cluster. These scripts are used to install additional components and change configuration settings. Script actions can be used during or after cluster creation.

A script action is Bash script that runs on the nodes in an HDInsight cluster. Script must be stored on a URI that is accessible from the HDInsight cluster. The script can be restricted to run on only certain node types.

The script can be persisted or executed one time. The persisted scripts are used to customize new worker nodes added to the cluster through scaling operations. A persisted script might also apply changes to another node type, such as a head node, when scaling operations occur.

HDInsight provides scripts to install the following components on HDInsight clusters: 

- Add an Azure Storage account
- Install Hue
- Install Presto
- Install Solr
- Install Giraph
- Pre-load Hive libraries
- Install or update Mono

> [!Note]
> HDInsight does not provide direct support for custom hadoop components or components installed using script actions.

Script actions can also be published to the Azure Marketplace as an HDInsight application. The

### Customize HDInsight configs using Bootstrap

Changes to configs in the config files such as core-site.xml, hive-site.xml and oozie-env.xml can be made using Bootstrap. The following is an example using Powershell:

```powershell
# hive-site.xml configuration
$hiveConfigValues = @{"hive.metastore.client.socket.timeout"="90"}

$config = New—AzureRmHDInsightClusterConfig '
    | Set—AzureRmHDInsightDefaultStorage
    —StorageAccountName "$defaultStorageAccountName.blob. core.windows.net" `
    —StorageAccountKey "defaultStorageAccountKey " `
    | Add—AzureRmHDInsightConfigValues `
        —HiveSite $hiveConfigValues

New—AzureRmHDInsightCluster `
    —ResourceGroupName $existingResourceGroupName `
    —Cluster-Name $clusterName `
    —Location $location `
    —ClusterSizeInNodes $clusterSizeInNodes `
    —ClusterType Hadoop `
    —OSType Linux `
    —Version "3.6" `
    —HttpCredential $httpCredential `
    —Config $config
```

For more information, see the article [Customize HDInsight clusters using Bootstrap](../hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-bootstrap.md)

### Use edge nodes on Hadoop clusters in HDInsight to access the client tools

An empty edge node is a Linux virtual machine with the same client tools installed and configured as in the head nodes, but with no Hadoop services running. The edge node can be used for the following purposes:

- accessing the cluster
- testing client applications
- hosting client applications

Edge nodes can be used during or after cluster creation. After the edge node has been created, you can connect to the edge node using SSH, and run client tools (for example, beeline and hive) to access the Hadoop cluster in HDInsight. The edge node ssh endpoint is `<EdgeNodeName>.<ClusterName>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:22`. The edge node can be deleted from the Azure portal.

For more information, see the article [Use empty edge nodes on Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](../hdinsight-apps-use-edge-node.md)

### Use the scale-up and scale-down feature of clusters

HDInsight provides elasticity by giving you the option to scale up and scale down the number of worker nodes in your clusters. This feature allows you to shrink a cluster after hours or on weekends and expand it during peak business demands.

Cluster scaling can be automated with the following methods:

#### PowerShell cmdlet

```powershell
Set-AzureRmHDInsightClusterSize -ClusterName <Cluster Name> -TargetInstanceCount <NewSize>
```

#### Azure CLI

```powershell
azure hdinsight cluster resize [options] <clusterName> <Target Instance Count>
```

#### Azure portal

When you add nodes to your running HDInsight cluster, any pending or running jobs will not be affected. New jobs can be safely submitted while the scaling process is running. If the scaling operations fail for any reason, the failure is gracefully handled, leaving the cluster in a functional state.

However, if you are scaling down your cluster by removing nodes, any pending or running jobs will fail when the scaling operation completes. This failure is caused by some of the services restarting during the process. To address this issue, you can wait for the jobs to complete before scaling down your cluster, manually terminate the jobs, or resubmit the jobs after the scaling operation has concluded.

If you shrink your cluster down to the minimum of one worker node, as shown in the previous image, HDFS may become stuck in safe mode when worker nodes are rebooted for patching, or immediately after the scaling operation. You can execute a command to bring HDFS out of safe mode.

```bash
hdfs dfsadmin -D 'fs.default.name=hdfs://mycluster/' -safemode leave
```

After leaving safe mode, you can manually remove the temporary files, or wait for Hive to eventually clean them up automatically.

For more information, see the article [Scale HDInsight clusters](../hdinsight-scaling-best-practices.md)

### Use HDInsight with Azure Virtual Network

Azure Virtual Network enables the Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines, to securely communicate with each other, communicate with the internet and on-premises networks, filtering and routing network traffic and connecting different virtual networks.

Using Azure Virtual Network with HDInsight enables the following scenarios:

- Connecting to HDInsight directly from an on-premises network.
- Connecting HDInsight to data stores in an Azure Virtual network.
- Directly accessing Hadoop services that are not available publicly over the internet. For example, Kafka APIs or the HBase Java API.

HDInsight can either be added to a new or existing Azure Virtual Network. If HDInsight is being added to an existing Virtual Network, the existing network security groups and user-defined routes need to be updated to allow unrestricted access to [several IP addresses](../hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network.md#hdinsight-ip-1)
in the Azure data center. Also, make sure not to block traffic to the [ports](../hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network.md#hdinsight-ports) which are being used by HDInsight services.

> [!Note]
> HDInsight does not currently support forced tunneling. Forced tunneling is a subnet setting that forces outbound Internet traffic to a device for inspection and logging. Either remove forced tunneling before installing HDInsight into a subnet or create a new subnet for HDInsight. HDInsight also does not support restricting outbound network connectivity.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Azure virtual-networks-overview](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md)
- [Extend Azure HDInsight using an Azure Virtual Network](../hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network.md)

### Use Azure Virtual Network service endpoints to securely connect to other Azure services

HDInsight supports [virtual network service endpoints](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md) which allows you to securely connect to Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Cosmos DB, and SQL databases. By enabling a Service Endpoint for Azure HDInsight, traffic flows through a secured route from within the Azure data center. With this enhanced level of security at the networking layer, you can lock down their big data storage accounts to their specified Virtual Networks (VNETs) and still use HDInsight clusters seamlessly to access and process that data.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Virtual network service endpoints](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md)
- [Enhance HDInsight security with service endpoints](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/enhance-hdinsight-security-with-service-endpoints/.md)

### Connect HDInsight to the on-premises network

HDInsight can be connected to the on-premises network by using Azure Virtual Networks and a VPN gateway. The following steps can be used to establish connectivity:

- Use HDInsight in an Azure Virtual Network that has connectivity to the on-premises network.
- Configure DNS name resolution between the virtual network and on-premises network.
- Configure network security groups or user-defined routes (UDR) to control network traffic.

 For more information, see the article [Connect HDInsight to your on-premises network](../connect-on-premises-network.md)

### Use the Enterprise Security Package to secure and govern the cluster

The Enterprise Security Package (ESP) supports Active Directory-based authentication, multiuser support, and role-based access control. With the ESP option chosen, HDInsight cluster is joined to the Active Directory domain and the enterprise admin can configure role-based access control (RBAC) for Hive security by using Apache Ranger. The admin can also audit the data access by employees and any changes done to access control policies.

ESP feature is currently in preview and is available only on the following cluster types: Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Kafka, and Interactive Query.

The following steps can be used to deploy the Domain-joined HDInsight cluster:

- Deploy Azure Active Directory (AAD) by passing the Domain name
- Deploy Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AAD DS)
- Create the required Virtual Network and subnet
- Deploy a VM in the Virtual Network to manage AAD DS
- Join the VM to the domain
- Install AD and DNS tools
- Have the AAD DS Administrator create an Organizational Unit (OU)
- Enable LDAPS for AAD DS
- Create a service account in Azure Active Directory with delegated read & write admin permission to the OU, so that it can. This service account can then join machines to the domain and place machine principals within the OU. It can also create service principals within the OU that you specify during cluster creation.

> [!Note]
> The service account does not need to be AD domain admin account

- Deploy HDInsight ESP cluster by passing the following parameters:
- **Domain name**: The domain name that's associated with Azure AD DS.
- **Domain user name**: The service account in the Azure AD DS DC-managed domain that you created in the previous section, for example: `hdiadmin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`. This domain user will be the administrator of this HDInsight cluster.

- **Domain password**: The password of the service account.
- **Organizational unit**: The distinguished name of the OU that you want to use with the HDInsight cluster, for example: `OU=HDInsightOU,DC=contoso,DC=onmicrosoft,DC=com`. If this OU does not exist, the HDInsight cluster tries to create the OU using the privileges of the service account.

- **LDAPS URL**: for example, `ldaps://contoso.onmicrosoft.com:636`.
- **Access user group**: The security groups whose users you want to sync to the cluster, for example: `HiveUsers`. If you want to specify multiple user groups, separate them by semicolon ';'. The group(s) must exist in the directory prior to creating the ESP cluster.

### Implement end to end enterprise security management

End to end enterprise security can be achieved using the following controls:

- **Private and protected data pipeline** (Perimeter level Security):
    - Perimeter level Security can be achieved through Azure Virtual Networks, Network Security Groups, and Gateway service

- **Authentication and authorization for Data Access**
    - Create Domain-joined HDI cluster using Azure Active Directory Domain Services. (Enterprise Security Package)
    - Use Ambari to provide Role-based access to cluster resources for AD users
    - Use Apache Ranger to set access control policies for Hive at the table / column / row level. 
    - SSH access to the cluster can be restricted only to the administrator.

- **Auditing**
    - View and report all access to the HDInsight cluster resources and data. 
    - View and report all changes to the access control policies

- **Encryption**
    - Transparent Server-Side encryption using Microsoft-managed keys as well as customer-managed keys.
    - In Transit encryption using Client-Side encryption, https and TLS

### Use external metadata stores with HDInsight clusters 

There are two main metastores that work with HDInsight clusters namely Hive and Oozie metastores. The Hive metastore is the central schema
repository that can be used by data processing engines including Hadoop, Spark, LLAP, Presto, and Pig. Oozie metastore stores details about schedule and status of current and completed Hadoop jobs.

HDInsight uses Azure SQL Database as the Hive and Oozie metastores. There are two ways to set up a metastore in HDInsight clusters:

- Default metastore
    - No additional cost
    - Metastore is deleted when the cluster is deleted
    - Metastore is not sharable among different clusters
    - Uses basic Azure SQL DB, which has a five DTU limit.

- Custom external metastore
    - specify an external Azure SQL Database as the metastore.
    - Clusters can be created and deleted without losing metadata including Hive schema Oozie job details.
    - Single metastore db can be shared with different types of clusters
    - Metastore can be scaled up as needed

For more information, see the article: [Use external metadata stores in Azure HDInsight](../hdinsight-use-external-metadata-stores.md)

### Best practices for Hive Metastore

Some HDInsight Hive metastore best practices are as follows:

- Use a custom external metastore, toS separate compute resources and metadata.
- Start with an S2 tier Azure SQL instance, which provides 50 DTU and 250 GB of storage. If you see a bottleneck, you can scale the database up.
- Ensure that the metastore created for one HDInsight cluster version is not shared with a different HDInsight cluster version. Different Hive versions use different schemas. For example, a metastore cannot be shared with both Hive 1.2 and Hive 2.1 clusters.
- Back up the custom metastore periodically.
- Keep the metastore and HDInsight cluster in the same region.
- Monitor the metastore for performance and availability using Azure SQL Database Monitoring tools, such as the Azure portal or Azure Log Analytics.
- Execute "Analyze table" command as required to generate statistics for tables and columns
Eg: `ANALYZE TABLE [table_name] COMPUTE STATISTICS`

### Best practices for different types of workloads

- Consider using LLAP cluster for interactive Hive queries with improved response time [LLAP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LLAP) is a new feature in Hive 2.0 that allows in-memory caching of queries. LLAP makes Hive queries much faster, up to [26x faster than Hive 1.x in some cases](https://hortonworks.com/blog/announcing-apache-hive-2-1-25x-faster-queries-much/).
- Consider using Spark jobs in place of Hive jobs
- Consider replacing impala-based queries with LLAP queries
- Consider replacing MapReduce jobs with Spark jobs
- Consider replacing low-latency Spark batch jobs using Spark Structured Streaming jobs
- Data orchestration -- consider using Azure Data Factory(ADF) 2.0
- Consider Ambari for Cluster Management
- Change data storage from on-premises HDFS to WASB or ADLS or ADFS for processing scripts
- Consider using Ranger RBAC on Hive tables and auditing
- Consider using CosmosDB in place of MongoDB or Cassandra

### Migrate data from on-premises to Azure

There are two main options to migrate data from on-premises to Azure environment

1.  Transfer data over network with TLS
    1.  Over internet
    2.  Express Route
2.  Shipping data
    1.  Import / Export service
        - Internal SATA HDDs or SSDs only
        - Encrypted at REST (AES-128 / AES-256)
        - Import job can have up to 10 disks
        - Available in all Public regions & GA
    1.  Data Box
        - Up to 80 TB of data per Data box
        - Encrypted at REST (AES-256)
        - Uses NAS protocols and supports common data copy tools
        - Ruggedized hardware
        - Available in US only & Public Preview

The following table has approximate data transfer duration based on the data volume and network bandwidth. The general recommendation is to use Data box if the data migration is expected to take more than three weeks.

|**Data Qty**|**Network Bandwidth**|||
|---|---|---|---|
|| **45 Mbps (T3)**|**100 Mbps**|**1 Gbps**|**10 Gbps**
|1 TB|2 days|1 day| 2 hours|14 minutes|
|10 TB|22 days|10 days|1 day|2 hours|
|35 TB|76 days|34 days|3 days|8 hours|
|80 TB|173 days|78 days|8 days|19 hours|
|100 TB|216 days|97 days|10 days|1 day|
|200 TB|1 year|194 days|19 days|2 days|
|500 TB|3 years|1 year|49 days|5 days|
|1 PB|6 years|3 years|97 days|10 days|
|2 PB|12 years|5 years|194 days|19 days|

DistCp, Azure Data Factory, AzureCp, and third-party tools including WANDisco could be used for data transfer over network. Kafka Mirrormaker and Sqoop could also be considered for ongoing data transfer from on-premises to Azure storage systems.

### Performance considerations when using DistCp

DistCp is an Apache project and uses MapReduce (Map only job) to transfer data, handle errors and recover. It assigns a list of source files to Map tasks, each of which will copy them to the destination. Some best practices for performance of DistCp are the following:

1. Consider increasing the number of Mappers. DistCp tries to create map tasks so that each one copies roughly the same number of bytes. By default, DistCp jobs use 20 mappers. Using more Mappers for Distcp (with the 'm' parameter at command line) increases parallelism during the data transfer process and decreases the data transfer duration. However, there are two things to consider while increasing the number of Mappers.

    - DistCp's lowest granularity is a single file and so specifying number of Mappers more than the number of source files does not help and will waste the available cluster resources.
    - Consider the available Yarn memory on the cluster to determine the number of Mappers. Each Map task is launched as a Yarn container. Assuming that no other heavy workloads are running on the cluster, the number of Mappers can be determined by the following formula: m = (number of worker nodes \* YARN memory for each worker node) / YARN container size. However, If other applications are using memory, then choose to only use a portion of YARN memory for DistCp jobs.

1. When the size of the dataset to be moved is larger than 1 TB, consider using multiple DistCp jobs. Using multiple jobs limits the impact of failures. If any job fails, you only need to restart that specific job rather than all of the jobs.
1. If there are a small number of large files, then consider splitting them into 256-MB file chunks to get more potential concurrency with more Mappers.
1. Consider using "strategy = dynamic" parameter in the command line. The default value of "strategy" parameter is "uniform size", in which case each map copies roughly the same number of bytes. When this parameter is changed to "dynamic", the listing-file is split into several "chunk-files", the exact number of chunk-files being a multiple of the number of maps. Each map task is assigned one of the chunk-files. After all the paths in a chunk are processed, the current chunk is deleted and a new chunk is acquired. The process continues until no more chunks are available. This "dynamic" approach allows faster map-tasks to consume more paths than slower ones, thus speeding up the DistCp job overall.
1. See if increasing "-numListstatusThreads" parameter improves performance. This parameter controls the number of threads to use for building file listing and 40 is the maximum value
1. See if passing the "-Dmapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version=2" improves DistCp performance. This output committer algorithm has a bunch of optimizations around writing the output files to the destination. The following command is an example that shows the usage of different parameters:

```bash
hadoop distcp -Dmapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version=2 -numListstatusThreads 30 -m 100 -strategy dynamic hdfs://nn1:8020/foo/bar wasb://<container_name>@<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/foo/
```

### Metadata Migration

#### Hive

The hive metastore can be migrated either by using the scripts or by using the DB Replication
- Hive metastore migration using scripts
- Generate the Hive DDLs from on-prem Hive metastore. This step can be done using a [wrapper bash script](https://github.com/hdinsight/hdinsight.github.io/blob/master/hive/hive-export-import-metastore.md)
- Edit the generated DDL to replace HDFS url with WASB/ADLS/ABFS urls
- Run the updated DDL on the metastore from the HDI cluster
- Make sure that the Hive metastore version is compatible between on-premises and cloud
- Hive metastore migration using DB Replication
- Set up Database Replication between on-premises Hive metastore DB and HDI metastore DB
- Use the "Hive MetaTool" to replace HDFS url with WASB/ADLS/ABFS urls, for example:

```bash
./hive --service metatool -updateLocation hdfs://nn1:8020/ wasb://<container_name>@<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/
```

#### Ranger

- Export on-premises Ranger policies to xml files
- Transform on-prem specific HDFS-based paths to WASB/ADLS using a tool like XSLT
- import the policies on to Ranger running on HDI

### Use monitoring & alerting

For more information, see the article:

[Azure Monitor Overview](../../azure-monitor/overview.md)

### Upgrade clusters

It is a good practice to upgrade to the latest HDInsight version so as to take advantage of the latest features. The following steps can be used to upgrade the cluster to the latest version:

- Create a new TEST HDI cluster using the latest available HDI version
- Perform testing on the new cluster to make sure that the jobs and workloads work as expected.
- Modify jobs or applications or workloads as required
- Back up any transient data stored locally on the cluster nodes.
- Delete the existing cluster.
- Create a cluster in the same VNET subnet with latest HDI version using the same default data and meta store that the previous cluster used.
- Import any transient data was backed up.
- Start jobs/continue processing using the new cluster.

For more information, see the article: [Upgrade HDInsight cluster to a new version](../hdinsight-upgrade-cluster.md)

### Patch cluster operating systems

As a managed Hadoop service, HDInsight takes care of patching the OS
of the underlying VMs used by HDInsight clusters. 

For more information, see the article: [OS patching for HDInsight](../hdinsight-os-patching.md)

### Post-Migration

1. **Remediate applications** - Iteratively make the necessary changes to the jobs, processes, and scripts
2. **Perform Tests** - Iteratively run functional and performance tests
3. **Optimize** - Address any performance issues based on the above test results and then retest to confirm the performance improvements.
