# Use Spark History Server to view completed and running Spark applications

This article provides guidance on how to use Spark History Server to view completed and running spark applications. You could get the input/output data under Data tab, and check the data flow under Graph tab.

## Open the Spark History Server

Spark History Server is the web UI for completed and running Spark applications. It is an extension of Spark's Web UI.

**To open the Spark History Server Web UI**

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), open the Spark cluster. For more information, see [List and show clusters](../hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux.md#list-and-show-clusters).
2. From **Quick Links**, click **Cluster Dashboard**, and then click **Spark History Server**

    ![Spark History Server](./media/apache-spark-resource-manager/launch-history-server.png "Spark History Server")

    When prompted, enter the admin credentials for the Spark cluster. You can also open the Spark History Server by browsing to the following URL:

    ```
    https://<ClusterName>.azurehdinsight.net/sparkhistory
    ```

    Replace <ClusterName> with your Spark cluster name.

The Spark History Server web UI looks like:

## Open the Data tab from Spark History Server
Select your job ID then click **Data** on the tool menu to get the data view.

Under this tab, you could:
1. Check the **Inputs**, **Outputs** and **Table Operations** by selecting the tabs separately.

    ![Data tabs](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-data-tabs.png)

2. Copy all rows by clicking button **Copy**.

    ![Data copy](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-data-copy.png)

3. Save all rows by clicking button **CSV**.

    ![Data save](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-data-save.png)

4. Search by entering keywords in field **Search**, the search result will display immediatly.

    ![Data search](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-data-search.png)

5. Click the column header to sort table, click the plug sign to expand a row to show more details, or click the minus sign to collect a row.

    ![Data table](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-data-table.png)


6. Download single row by clicking button **Partition Download** that place at each row, and the selected row will download to local, otherwise, it will open a new tab to show the error messages.

    ![Data download row](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-data-download-row.png)

7. Copy full path or relative path by selecting the **Copy Full Path**, **Copy Relative Path** that expand from download menu. For azure data lake storage files, **Open in Azure Storage Explorer** will launch Azure Storage Explorer, and locate to the folder when sign in.

8. Click the number below the table to navigate pages when too many rows to display in one page. 

    ![Data page](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-data-page.png)

9. Hover on the question mark beside Data to show the tooltip, and click it to get more information.

10. Any issue please provide us feedback by clicking “Provide us feedback”

## Open the Graph tab from Spark History Server
Select your job ID then click **Graph** on the tool menu to get the graph view.

Under this tab, you could:
1. Take an overview of your job by the generated graph. 

2. Filter by **Job ID** or check the graph for all jobs that is default view.

    ![graph job id](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-graph-jobid.png)

3. Filter with data flow by selecting Read/Written in **Display** to check the data read, written, or progress which is default selection. The stage display in color that depend on the data flow.

    ![graph display](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-graph-display.png)

4. Playback by clicking the **Playback** button and could stop anytime by clicking the stop button. The task display in color with different status when playback.
    + Successed task display in green.
    + Running task display in light blue.
    + Retried task display in orange.
    + Failed task display in red.
    + Waiting or skipped task display in white.

    ![graph color sample, failed](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-graph-color-failed.png)
 
    > Note: Playback for each job is allowed. When a job does not have any stage or haven’t complete, playback is not supported.


5. Mouse scroll to zoom in/out the graph, and you could click **Zoom to fit** to make it fit to screen.
 
    ![graph zoom to fit](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-graph-zoom2fit.png)

6. Hover on stage to see the tooltip when there are failed tasks, and click on stage to open stage page.

    ![graph tooltip](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-graph-tooltip.png)

7. The graph node will display the following information of each stage.
    + ID.
    + Name or description.
    + Total task number.
    + Data read, the sum of input size and shuffle read size.
    + Data write, the sum of output size and shuffle write size.
    + Execution time, the time between start time of the first attempt and completion time of the last attempt.
    + Row count, the sum of input records, output records, shuffle read records and shuffle write records.
    + Progress.

    >Note: By default the graph node will display information from last attempt of each stage (except for stage execution time), but during playback stage node will show information of each attempt.

    >Note: For data size of read and write we use 1MB = 1000 KB = 1000 * 1000 Bytes.

8. Any issue please provide us feedback by clicking **Provide us feedback**.

## FAQ

### Upload history server log

**upload_shs_log.sh** is used for upload history server log to the blob storage specified by us(who is working on investigating the history server issues).

    ```upload_shs_log.sh
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

    # Arguments:
    # $1 Blob link with SAS token query string 
    # $2 Log path
    # $3 Max log file size in MB

    if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
        >&2 echo "$@"
        >&2 echo "Please provide Azure Storage link, log path and max log size."
        exit 1
    fi

    blob_link=$1
    log_path=$2
    max_log_size=$3

    if ! [ -e "$log_path" ]; then
        >&2 echo "There is no log path $log_path on this node"
        exit 0 
    fi

    tail -c $((1024*1024*max_log_size)) \
        "$log_path" > /tmp/shs_log_for_trouble_shooting.log

    curl -T /tmp/shs_log_for_trouble_shooting.log \
        -X PUT \
        -H "x-ms-date: $(date -u)" \
        -H "x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob" \
        "$blob_link"
    ```

**Usage**: 

`upload_shs_log.sh ${blob_link} ${log_path} ${log_max_MB_size}`

**Example**:

`upload_shs_log.sh https://${account_name}.blob.core.windows.net/${blob_container }/${log_file}?{SAS_query_string} /var/log/spark2/spark-spark-org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServer-1-{head_node_alias}-spark2.out 100`

For **head_node_alias**, it may be **hn0** or **hn1** for a cluster with 2 head nodes. We need to fill in the active head node alias.

For **SAS_query_string**, you can get it from ASE: 
1.	Right click the container you want to use and choose **Get Shared Access Signature…**:
 
    ![get shared access signature](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-faq1-1.png)

2.	Choose permissions with **Write** and adjust the **Start time** and **Expiry time**:

    ![shared access signature](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-faq1-2.png)

3.	Click **Copy** to copy the query string:

    ![copy query string](./media/apache-spark-history-server/sparkui-faq1-3.png)


### Upgrade jar file for hotfix scenario

**upgrade_spark_enhancement.sh** is used for upgrade our **spark-enhancement*.jar** for hotfix scenario.

    ```upload_shs_log.sh
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

    # Arguments:
    # $1 Enhancement jar path

    if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
        >&2 echo "Please provide the upgrade jar path."
        exit 1
    fi

    jar_path=$1
    jars_folder="/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client/jars/"

    rm -f ${jars_folder}/spark-enhancement*
    wget -P ${jars_folder} "$jar_path" 
    ```


**Usage**: 

`upgrade_spark_enhancement.sh https://${jar_path}`
