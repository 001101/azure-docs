# Perform advanced  monitoring using the remote monitoring solution

As an operator, you need to monitor the location and behavior of your trucks in the field. In this tutorial, you use two simulated truck devices to learn how to monitor your devices from the preconfigured solution dashboard.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

>[!div class="checklist"]
> * Filter the devices in the dashboard
> * View real-time telemetry
> * View device details
> * View alarms from your devices
> * View the system KPIs

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a deployed instance of the remote monitoring solution in your Azure subscription.

If you haven't deployed the remote monitoring solution yet, you should complete the [Deploy the remote monitoring preconfigured solution](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy.md) tutorial.

## Filter the devices in the dashboard

Use the previously created filter to show in the map where the truck is, and the corresponding telemetry chart.


### Drilling through the maps



## View real-time telemetry

### Map

#### Map summary

### Telemetry chart

#### Choosing telemetry

#### Pausing telemetry flow

## View device details

## View alarms from your devices

## View the system KPIs

## Next steps

This tutorial showed you how to:

<!-- Repeat task list from intro -->
>[!div class="checklist"]
> * Filter the devices in the dashboard
> * View real-time telemetry
> * View device details
> * View alarms from your devices
> * View the system KPIs

Now that you have learned how to monitor your devices, the suggested next steps are to learn how to:

* [Detect issues using threshold based rules](./iot-suite-remote-monitoring-automate.md).
* [Manage and configure your devices](./iot-suite-remote-monitoring-manage.md).
* [Troubleshoot and remediate device issues](./iot-suite-remote-monitoring-maintain.md).
* [Test your solution with simulated devices](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-test.md).
