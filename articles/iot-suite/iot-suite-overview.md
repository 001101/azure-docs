# What is Azure IoT Suite?

Azure IoT Suite is a collection of preconfigured IoT solutions that you can deploy to your Azure subscription. Each *preconfigured solution* is a base implementation of a common IoT solution pattern such as remote monitoring or predictive maintenance. You can customize and extend these solutions to meet your specific requirements. You can also use these solutions as examples or templates when you develop new IoT solutions.

## Compare IoT Suite, IoT Central, and IoT Hub

You can use IoT Suite, IoT Central, or IoT Hub to build your IoT solution. The following table summarizes the key differences between these services to help you choose the correct one to meet your requirements:

|   | IoT Suite | IoT Central | IoT Hub |
| - | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Service type | PaaS | SaaS | IaaS |

<!-- Extend table with info from Cory and Hector -->

Both IoT Suite and IoT Central use IoT Hub for core IoT services such as telemetry and device management.

## Use preconfigured solutions

IoT Suite preconfigured solutions enable you to quickly get started with and to explore the common IoT scenarios, such as:

* Remote monitoring
* Predictive maintenance
* Connected factory

You can deploy these solutions to your Azure subscription and then run complete, end-to-end IoT scenarios.

The preconfigured solutions implement a number of core IoT capabilities. These enterprise grade solutions deliver services such as:

* Collect data from devices
* Analyze data streams in-motion
* Store and query large data sets
* Visualize both real-time and historical data
* Integrate with back-office systems
* Manage your devices

To deliver these capabilities, Azure IoT Suite packages together multiple Azure services with custom code as preconfigured solutions.
