## Project overview

### Implementations

The remote monitoring solution has both .NET and Java implementations. Both implementations provide similar functionality and rely on the same underlying Azure services. You can find the top-level GitHub repositories here:

* [.NET solution](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet)
* [Java solution](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-java)

### Microservices

If you are interested in a specific feature of the solution, you can access the GitHub repositories for each individual microservice. Each microservice implements a different part of the solution functionality. To learn more about the overall architecture, see [Remote monitoring preconfigured solution architecture](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-sample-walkthrough.md).

This table summarizes the current availability of each microservice for each language:

<!-- please add links for each of the repos in the table, you can find them here https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-team/wiki/Repositories-->

## Presentation and visualization

The following sections describe options to customize the presentation and visualizations layer in the remote monitoring solution:

### Modify the UI

The remote monitoring PCS UI code is implemented using the React.js framework. You can find the source code in the [azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-webui](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-webui) GitHub repository.

To make changes to the UI, you can run a copy of it locally. The local copy connects to a deployed instance of the solution to perform actions such as retrieving telemetry.

The following steps outline the process to set up a local environment for UI development:

1. Deploy a **basic** instance of the preconfigured solution using the `pcs` CLI. Make a note of the name of your deployment and the credentials you provided for the virtual machine. For more information, see [Deploy using the CLI](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy-cli.md).

1. Use the Azure portal or the [az](../cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) CLI to enable SSH access to the virtual machine that hosts the microservices in your solution. For example:

    ```sh
    az network nsg rule update --name SSH --nsg-name {your solution name}-nsg --resource-group {your solution name} --access Allow
    ```

1. Use the Azure portal or the [az](../cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) CLI to find the name and public IP address of your virtual machine. For example:

    ```sh
    az resource list --resource-group {your solution name} -o table
    az vm list-ip-addresses --name {your vm name from previous command} --resource-group {your solution name} -o table
    ```

1. Use SSH to connect to your virtual machine using the IP address from the previous step, and the credentials you provided when you ran `pcs` to deploy the solution.

1. To allow the local UX to connect, run the following commands at the bash shell in the virtual machine:

    ```sh
    cd /app
    sudo ./start.sh --unsafe
    ```

1. After you see the message `WARNING! Starting services in UNSAFE mode!`, you can disconnect from the virtual machine.

1. In your local copy of the [azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-webui](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-webui) repository, edit the **.env** file to add the URL of your deployed solution:

    ```config
    NODE_PATH = src/
    REACT_APP_BASE_SERVICE_URL=https://{your solution name}.azurewebsites.net/
    ```

1. At a command prompt in your local copy of the `azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-webui` folder, run the following commands to install the required libraries and run the UI locally:

    ```cmd/sh
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

1. The previous command runs the UI locally at http://localhost:3000/dashboard. You can edit the code while the site is running and see it update dynamically.

### Duplicate an existing control

Each page in the remote monitoring solution is composed of a set of controls, referred to as *panels* in the source code. For example, the **Dashboard** page is made up of five panels: Overview, Map, Alarms, Telemetry, and KPIs. You can find the source code that defines each page and its panels in the [pcs-remote-monitoring-webui](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-remote-monitoring-webui) GitHub repository. For example, the code that defines the **Dashboard** page, its layout, and the panels on the page is located in the [src/components/pages/dashboard](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-remote-monitoring-webui/tree/master/src/components/pages/dashboard) folder.

The following steps outline how to duplicate and existing panel, modify it, and use the modified version. The steps use the **alarms** panel as an example:

1. In your local copy of the repository, make a copy of the **alarms** folder in the `src/components/pages/dashboard/panels` folder. Name the new copy **cust_alarms**.

1. In the **alarmsPanel.js** file in the **cust_alarms** folder, edit the name of the class to be **CustAlarmsPanel**:

    ```nodejs
    export class CustAlarmsPanel extends Component {
    ```

1. Add the following line to the `src/components/pages/dashboard/panels/index.js` file:

    ```nodejs
    export * from './cust_alarms';
    ```

1. Replace `AlarmsPanel` with `CustAlarmsPanel` in the `src/components/pages/dashboard/dashboard.js` file:

    ```nodejs
    import {
      OverviewPanel,
      CustAlarmsPanel,
      TelemetryPanel,
      KpisPanel,
      MapPanel,
      transformTelemetryResponse,
      chartColors
    } from './panels';

    ...

    <Cell className="col-3">
      <CustAlarmsPanel
        alarms={currentActiveAlarmsWithName}
        isPending={kpisIsPending || rulesIsPending}
        error={rulesError || kpisError}
        t={t} />
    </Cell>
    ```

You have now replaced the original **Alarms** panel with a copy called **CustAlarms**. This copy is identical to the original. You can now modify the copy. For example, to change the column ordering in the **Alarms** panel:

1. Open the `src/components/pages/dashboard/panels/cust_alarms/alarmsPanel.js` file.

1. Modify the column definitions as shown in the following code snippet:

    ```nodejs
    this.columnDefs = [
      rulesColumnDefs.severity,
      {
        headerName: 'rules.grid.count',
        field: 'count'
      },
      {
        ...rulesColumnDefs.ruleName,
        minWidth: 200
      },
      rulesColumnDefs.explore
    ];
    ```

The following screenshot shows the new version of the **Alarms** panel:

![Alarms panel updated](media/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-customize/reorder-columns.png)

### Customize the telemetry chart

The telemetry chart on the **Dashboard** page is defined by the files in the `src/components/pages/dashboard/panels/telemtry` folder. The UI retrieves the telemetry from the solution back end in the `src/services/telemetryService.js` file. The following steps show you how to change the time period displayed on the telemetry chart from 15 minutes to five minutes:

1. In the `src/services/telemetryService.js` file, locate the function called **getTelemetryByDeviceIdP15M**. Make a copy of this function and modify the copy as follows:

    ```nodejs
    static getTelemetryByDeviceIdP5M(devices = []) {
      return TelemetryService.getTelemetryByMessages({
        from: 'NOW-PT5M',
        to: 'NOW',
        order: 'desc',
        devices
      });
    }
    ```

1. To use this new function to populate the telemetry chart, open the `src/components/pages/dashboard/dashboard.js` file. Locate the line that initializes the telemetry stream and modify it as follows:

    ```node.js
    const getTelemetryStream = ({ deviceIds = [] }) => TelemetryService.getTelemetryByDeviceIdP5M(deviceIds)
    ```

The telemetry chart now shows the last five minutes worth of telemetry data:

![Telemetry chart showing five minutes](media/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-customize/telemetry-period.png)

### Add a new KPI

The **Dashboard** page displays KPIs in the **System KPIs** panel. These KPIs are calculated in the `src/components/pages/dashboard/dashboard.js` file. The KPIs are rendered by the `src/components/pages/dashboard/panels/kpis/kpisPanel.js` file. The following steps describe how to calculate and render a new KPI value on the **Dashboard** page. The example shown is to add a new percentage change in warning alarms KPI:

1. Open the `src/components/pages/dashboard/dashboard.js` file. Modify the **initialState** object to include a **warningAlarmsChange** property as follows:

    ```nodejs
    const initialState = {
      ...

      // Kpis data
      currentActiveAlarms: [],
      topAlarms: [],
      alarmsPerDeviceId: {},
      criticalAlarmsChange: 0,
      warningAlarmsChange: 0,
      kpisIsPending: true,
      kpisError: null,

      ...
    };
    ```

1. Modify the **currentAlarmsStats** object to include **totalWarningCount** as a property:

    ```nodejs
    return {
      openWarningCount: (acc.openWarningCount || 0) + (isWarning && isOpen ? 1 : 0),
      openCriticalCount: (acc.openCriticalCount || 0) + (isCritical && isOpen ? 1 : 0),
      totalWarningCount: (acc.totalWarningCount || 0) + (isWarning ? 1 : 0),
      totalCriticalCount: (acc.totalCriticalCount || 0) + (isCritical ? 1 : 0),
      alarmsPerDeviceId: updatedAlarmsPerDeviceId
    };
    ```

1. Calculate the new KPI. Find the calculation for the critical alarms count. Duplicate the code and modify the copy as follows:

    ```nodejs
    // ================== Warning Alarms Count - START
    const currentWarningAlarms = currentAlarmsStats.totalWarningCount;
    const previousWarningAlarms = previousAlarms.reduce(
      (cnt, { severity }) => severity === 'warning' ? cnt + 1 : cnt,
      0
    );
    const warningAlarmsChange = ((currentWarningAlarms - previousWarningAlarms) / currentWarningAlarms * 100).toFixed(2);
    // ================== Warning Alarms Count - END
    ```

1. Include the new **warningAlarmsChange** KPI in the KPI stream:

    ```nodejs
    return ({
      kpisIsPending: false,

      // Kpis data
      currentActiveAlarms,
      topAlarms,
      criticalAlarmsChange,
      warningAlarmsChange,
      alarmsPerDeviceId: currentAlarmsStats.alarmsPerDeviceId,

      ...
    });

1. Include the new **warningAlarmsChange** KPI in the state data used to render the UI:

    ```nodejs
    const {
      ...

      currentActiveAlarms,
      topAlarms,
      alarmsPerDeviceId,
      criticalAlarmsChange,
      warningAlarmsChange,
      kpisIsPending,
      kpisError,

      ...
    } = this.state;
    ```

1. Update the data passed to the KPIs panel:

    ```node.js
    <KpisPanel
      topAlarms={topAlarmsWithName}
      alarmsPerDeviceId={alarmsPerDeviceType}
      criticalAlarmsChange={criticalAlarmsChange}
      warningAlarmsChange={warningAlarmsChange}
      isPending={kpisIsPending || rulesIsPending || devicesIsPending}
      error={devicesError || rulesError || kpisError}
      colors={chartColorObjects}
      t={t} />
    ```

You have now finished the changes in the `src/components/pages/dashboard/dashboard.js` file. The following steps describe the changes to make in the `src/components/pages/dashboard/panels/kpis/kpisPanel.js` file to display the new KPI:

1. Modify the following line of code to retrieve the new KPI value as follows:

    ```nodejs
    const { t, isPending, criticalAlarmsChange, warningAlarmsChange, error } = this.props;
    ```

1. Modify the markup to display the new KPI value as follows:

    ```nodejs
    <div className="kpi-cell">
      <div className="kpi-header">{t('dashboard.panels.kpis.criticalAlarms')}</div>
      <div className="critical-alarms">
        {
          criticalAlarmsChange !== 0 &&
            <div className="kpi-percentage-container">
              <div className="kpi-value">{ criticalAlarmsChange }</div>
              <div className="kpi-percentage-sign">%</div>
            </div>
        }
      </div>
      <div className="kpi-header">{t('Warning alarms')}</div>
      <div className="critical-alarms">
        {
          warningAlarmsChange !== 0 &&
            <div className="kpi-percentage-container">
              <div className="kpi-value">{ warningAlarmsChange }</div>
              <div className="kpi-percentage-sign">%</div>
            </div>
        }
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

The **Dashboard** page now displays the new KPI value:

### Other customization options

To further modify the presentation and visualizations layer in the remote monitoring solution, you can edit the code. The relevant GitHub repositories are:

* [UIConfig (.NET)](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-ui-config-dotnet/)
* [UIConfig (Java)](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-ui-config-java/)
* [Azure PCS Remote Monitoring WebUI](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-remote-monitoring-webui)

## Device connectivity and streaming

The following sections describe options to customize the device connectivity and streaming layer in the remote monitoring solution. [Device models](https://github.com/Azure/device-simulation-dotnet/wiki/Device-Models) describe the device types and telemetry in the solution. You use device models for both simulated and physical devices.

For an example of a physical device implementation, see [Connect your device to the remote monitoring preconfigured solution](iot-suite-connecting-devices-node.md).

If you are using a _physical device_, you must provide the client application with a device model that contains the device metadata and telemetry specification.

The following sections discuss using device models with simulated devices:

### Add a telemetry type

The device types in the Contoso demo solution specify the telemetry that each device type sends. To specify the additional telemetry types, a device can send telemetry definitions as metadata to the solution. If you use this format, the dashboard consumes your device telemetry and available methods dynamically and you don't need to modify the UI. Alternatively, you can modify the device type definition in the solution.

To learn how to add custom telemetry in the _device simulator_ microservice, see [Test your solution with simulated devices](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-test.md).

### Add a device type

The Contoso demo solution defines some sample device types. The solution enables you to define custom device types to meet your specific application requirements. For example, your company may use an industrial gateway as the primary device connected to the solution.

To create an accurate representation of your device, you need to modify the application that runs on your device to match the device requirements.

To learn how to add a new device type in the _device simulator_ microservice, see [Test your solution with simulated devices](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-test.md).

### Define custom methods for simulated devices

To learn how to define custom methods for simulated devices in the remote monitoring solution, see [Device Models](https://github.com/Azure/device-simulation-dotnet/wiki/%5BAPI-Specifications%5D-Device-Models) in the GitHub repository.
