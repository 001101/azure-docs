# Detect issues using threshold based rules

In the sample scenario for Contoso, there is a rule that generates a critical alert when the pressure reported by a chiller device exceeds 250 PSI. As an operator, you want to indentify chillers that may have problematic sensors by looking for initial pressure spikes. To identify these chillers you create a rule to generate a warning alert when the pressure exceeds 150 PSI.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * View the rules in your solution
> * Create a new rule
> * Edit an existing rule
> * Delete a rule

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a deployed instance of the remote monitoring solution in your Azure subscription.

If you haven't deployed the remote monitoring solution yet, you should complete the [Deploy the remote monitoring preconfigured solution](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy.md) tutorial.

## Create a new rule

<!-- Add steps to create the new rules -->

## View the rules in your solution

<!-- Review the existing fan rules? --> Yes

## Edit an existing rule

<!-- Tweak one of the existing fan rules? --> Yes

## Delete a rule

<!-- For completeness, point out how to delete (and/or disable?) a rule --> Yes

## Next steps

This tutorial showed you how to:

<!-- Repeat task list from intro -->
>[!div class="checklist"]
> * View the rules in your solution
> * Create a new rule
> * Edit an existing rule
> * Delete a rule

Now that you have learned how to detect issues using threshold based rules, the suggested next steps are to learn how to:

* [Manage and configure your devices](./iot-suite-remote-monitoring-manage.md).
* [Troubleshoot and remediate device issues](./iot-suite-remote-monitoring-maintain.md).
* [Test your solution with simulated devices](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-test.md).
