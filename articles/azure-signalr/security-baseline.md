# Azure security baseline for Azure SignalR Service

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure SignalR. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure SignalR. **Controls** not applicable to Azure SignalR have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure SignalR completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure SignalR security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/41395.).

**Guidance**: Azure SignalR Service uses Azure Active Directory that supports strong authentication controls through multi-factor authentication (MFA), and strong passwordless methods.

Multi-factor authentication - Enable Azure AD MFA and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices in your MFA setup. MFA can be enforced on all, selected users or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors.

Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method are used, followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/41396.).

**Guidance**: Azure SignalR Service is integrated with Azure Active Directory in which provides the following data sources:

Sign-ins - The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

These data sources can be integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or third party SIEM systems.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription.

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a security solution that can use Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions.

### PA-2: Restrict administrative access to business-critical systems

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/41421.).

**Guidance**: Azure SignalR Service uses Azure RBAC to isolate access to business-critical systems by restricting which accounts are granted privileged access to the subscriptions and management groups they are in.

Ensure that you also restrict access to the management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business critical access such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.

All types of access controls should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy to ensure consistent access control.

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/41422.).

**Guidance**: Azure SignalR Service uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts to manage its resources, review user accounts and access assignment regularly to ensure the accounts and their access are valid. You can use Azure AD access reviews to review group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. Azure AD reporting can provide logs to help discover stale accounts. You can also use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to create access review report workflow to facilitate the review process.

In addition, Azure Privileged Identity Management can also be configured to alert when an excessive number of administrator accounts are created, and to identify administrator accounts that are stale or improperly configured.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/41423.).

**Guidance**: Azure SignalR Service uses Azure Active Directory to manage its resources. To prevent being accidentally locked out of your Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass"' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency.
