# Create a SignalR Service with an App Service

This Azure SignalR Service sample script creates a new SignalR Service resource, which is used to push real-time content updates to clients. This script also adds a new App Service and App Service plan to host your ASP.NET Core Web App that uses the Azure SignalR Service.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

This script creates a new SignalR Service resource with a new Azure App Service for pushing real-time updates to ASP.NET web app clients.

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/azure-signalr/create-signalr-with-app-service/create-signalr-with-app-service.sh "Creates a new Azure SignalR Service with a new Azure App Service")]

Make a note of the actual name generated for the new resource group. You will use that generated resource group name when you want to delete all group resources.

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]
