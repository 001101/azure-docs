# Quickstart: Create a chat room with SignalR Service

Azure SignalR Service is an Azure managed service that helps developers easily build web applications with real-time features. This service is based on [SignalR for ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2017/09/14/announcing-signalr-for-asp-net-core-2-0/).

This topic shows you how to get started with the SignalR Service. In this quickstart you will create a chat application using an ASP.NET Core MVC Web App web app with the SignalR Service. 

The code for this tutorial is available for download in the [AzureSignalR-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspnet/AzureSignalR-samples/tree/master/samples/ChatRoom).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]


## Prerequisites

* Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows)
* Download or clone the [AzureSignalR-sample](https://github.com/aspnet/AzureSignalR-samples) github repository.

## Create an Azure SignalR resource

[!INCLUDE [azure-signalr-create](../../includes/signalr-create.md)]

## Create an ASP.NET Core web app

In this section you use the [.NET Core command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x) to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC Web App project.

1. Open a command prompt and create a new folder for your project. In this article the *E:\Testing\chattest* folder is created and used.

        E:\Testing>md chattest
        E:\Testing>cd chattest
        E:\Testing\chattest>

2. In the new folder, execute the following command to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC Web App project:

        dotnet new mvc



## Add Azure SignalR to the web app


1. Add a reference to the *Microsoft.Azure.SignalR* NuGet package by executing the following command:

        dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.SignalR -v 1.0.0-preview-10001


2. Add a new environment variable named *AzureSignalRConnectionStringKey*. This variable will contain the connection string to access your Signalr Service resource. Based on the example command below, paste in your connection string for the value:

        set AzureSignalRConnectionStringKey=Endpoint=<your hostname>;AccessKey=<Your access key>;

    This environment variable is only used for testing the web app while it is hosted locally. In a later tutorial, you will deploy the web app to Azure. Once the web app is deployed to Azure, you will use an application setting in place of the environment variable.

3. In your project directory, add a new code file named *Constants.cs*. This file will contain the constant name of the connection string used to access your SignalR Service resource. Add the following code:

    ```cscharp
    namespace Microsoft.Azure.SignalR.Samples.ChatRoom
    {
        internal static class Constants
        {
            public const string AzureSignalRConnectionStringKey = "AzureSignalRConnectionString";
        }
    }
    ```

4. Open *Startup.cs* and update the `ConfigureServices` method to make the web app a singleton and use the SignalR Service resource by calling the `services.AddAzureSignalR()` method:

    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddMvc();
        services.AddSingleton(typeof(IConfiguration), Configuration);
        services.AddAzureSignalR();
    }
    ```

5. Also in *Startup.cs*, update the `Configure` method by removing the call to `app.UseStaticFiles()` and adding the following code in its place:

    ```csharp
        app.UseFileServer();
        app.UseAzureSignalR(Configuration[Constants.AzureSignalRConnectionStringKey],
            builder => 
            { 
                builder.UseHub<Chat>(); 
            });
    ```            

## Add a hub class

In SignalR, a hub is a core concept that exposes a set of methods that can be called from client. In this section you define a hub class with two methods: 

* `Broadcast()`: This method broadcasts a message to all clients.
* `Echo()`: This method sends a message back to the caller.

Both methods use the `Clients` interface provided by the SignalR Core SDK. This interface gives you access to all connected clients enabling you to push content to your clients.

1. Add a new file named *Chat.cs* in a new folder named *Hub*.

2. Add the following code to *Chat.cs* to define you hub class:

    ```csharp
    namespace chattest
    {
        using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;

        public class Chat : Hub
        {
            public void broadcastMessage(string name, string message)
            {
                Clients.All.SendAsync("broadcastMessage", name, message);
            }

            public void echo(string name, string message)
            {
                Clients.Client(Context.ConnectionId).SendAsync("echo", name, message + " (echo from server)");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Save *Chat.cs*.

## Add an authentication controller

The connection string contains sensitive access data and should only be used by server-side code to connect to the SignalR Service resource. You would not normally want to allow client-side code direct access to the service using the connection string. Code running as a client of the web app should authenticate with the web app in order to authorize access to SignalR functionality. 

Azure SignalR Service gives you the flexibility to implement your own authentication. In this article, you aren't going to include real authentication. Instead you will simply issue the token when requested. You will implement real authentication in a later tutorial. 

In this section you will implement an API issues a token to the client. Code running client-side can then use this token to connect to the service to push content updates.

1. Add a new controller code file to the *chattest\Controllers* directory. Name the file *AuthController.cs*.

2. Add the following code to the authentication controller:

    ```csharp
    namespace chattest
    {
        using System.Security.Claims;
        using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
        using Microsoft.Azure.SignalR;
        using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

        [Route("api/auth")]
        public class AuthController : Controller
        {
            private readonly EndpointProvider _endpointProvider;
            private readonly TokenProvider _tokenProvider;

            public AuthController(IConfiguration config)
            {
                var connStr = config[Constants.AzureSignalRConnectionStringKey];
                _endpointProvider = CloudSignalR.CreateEndpointProviderFromConnectionString(connStr);
                _tokenProvider = CloudSignalR.CreateTokenProviderFromConnectionString(connStr);
            }

            [HttpGet("{hubName}")]
            public IActionResult GenerateJwtBearer(string hubName, [FromQuery] string uid)
            {
                var serviceUrl = _endpointProvider.GetClientEndpoint(hubName);
                var accessToken =_tokenProvider.GenerateClientAccessToken(hubName, new[]
                {
                    new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, uid)
                });

                return new OkObjectResult(new
                {
                    ServiceUrl = serviceUrl,
                    AccessToken = accessToken
                });
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    The Azure SignalR SDK defines the `GenerateClientAccessToken()` method. This method is used to help issue the token based on the connection string, once you authenticate a client.

    Along with a valid token, this API also returns the *serviceURL* in the response body. This token and *serviceURL* are used by the client to authenticate the connection used to push content updates to all clients.    


## Add the web app client interface

The client user interface for this chat room app will be composed of HTML and JavaScript in a file named *index.html* in the *wwwroot* directory.

1. Copy the *css* and *scripts* folders from the [sample repository](https://github.com/aspnet/AzureSignalR-samples/tree/master/samples/ChatRoomLocal/wwwroot) into your *wwwroot* folder.

2. Copy *index.html* from the [sample repository](https://github.com/aspnet/AzureSignalR-samples/tree/master/samples/ChatRoomLocal/wwwroot) into your *wwwroot* folder.

    In the code for *index.html*, the `getAccessToken` JavaScript function calls into *AuthController* on the server-side in order to authenticate and request an access token for the client. If successul, this token is returned in the body of the response along with the *serviceURL*. The token and *serviceURL* will be used by the `startConnection` JavaScript function to authenticate a connection to the Azure SignalR resource.
    
    If the connection is successfully authenticated, that connection is passed to the `onConnected` JavaScript function, which adds the button event handlers. These handlers use the connection to push content updates to all connected clients.


## Build and Run the app locally

1. To build the app using the .NET Core CLI, execute the following command in the command shell:

        dotnet build

2. Once the build successfully completes, execute the following command to run the web app locally:

        dotnet run

    By default, the app will be hosted locally on port 5000:

        E:\Testing\chattest>dotnet run
        Hosting environment: Production
        Content root path: E:\Testing\chattest
        Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
        Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.    

3. Launch two browser windows and navigate each browser to `http://localhost:5000`. You will be prompted to enter your name. Enter a client name for both clients and test pushing message content between both clients using the **Send** button.

## Clean up resources

If you will be continuing to the next tutorial, you can keep the resources created in this quickstart and reuse them with the next tutorial.

Otherwise, if you are finished with the quickstart sample application, you can delete the Azure resources created in this quickstart to avoid charges. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible and that the resource group and all the resources in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the resources for hosting this sample inside an existing resource group that contains resources you want to keep, you can delete each resource individually from their respective blades instead of deleting the resource group.
> 
> 

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and click **Resource groups**.

In the **Filter by name...** textbox, type the name of your resource group. The instructions for this topic used a resource group named *SignalRTestResources*. On your resource group in the result list, click **...** then **Delete resource group**.

   
![Delete](./media/signalr-quickstart-dotnet-core/signalr-delete-resource-group.png)


You will be asked to confirm the deletion of the resource group. Type the name of your resource group to confirm, and click **Delete**.
   
After a few moments the resource group and all of its contained resources are deleted.



## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've created a new Azure SignalR Service resource and used to in an ASP.NET Core Web app to push content updates in real-time to multiple connected clients. To learn more about using Azure SignalR Server, continue to the next tutorial that demonstrates authentication with OAuth.
