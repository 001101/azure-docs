# Tutorial: Integrate Azure Functions with Azure SignalR Service


[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Improve data throughput and reduce database load by storing and retrieving data using Azure Redis Cache.
> * Use a Redis sorted set to retrieve the top five teams.
> * Provision the Azure resources for the application using a Resource Manager template.
> * Publish the application to Azure using Visual Studio.


## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following prerequisites:

* This tutorial continues to update the *ContosoTeamStats* ASP.NET web app created in the [ASP.NET quickstart for Azure Redis Cache](cache-web-app-howto.md). If you have not completed those steps to set up your cache and Azure App service, complete that first.
* Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with the following workloads:
    * ASP.NET and web development
    * Azure Development
    * .NET desktop development with SQL Server Express LocalDB or [SQL Server 2017 Express edition](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express).
* You need an Azure account to complete the quickstart. You can [Open an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=redis_cache_hero). You get credits that can be used to try out paid Azure services. Even after the credits are used up, you can keep the account and use free Azure services and features.
