# What is Azure Virtual WAN? - Preview

**This article is in progress**

Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service providing optimized and automated branch to branch connectivity through Azure. Azure Virtual WAN lets you connect and configure branch devices to communicate with Azure either manually, or with preferred partner devices. Using preferred partner devices allows you ease of use, simplification of connectivity and configuration management. The built-in dashboard provides instant troubleshooting insights that can help save you time and gives you an easy way to view large-scale site-to-site connectivity.

Azure Virtual WAN lets you automatically connect and configure on-premises devices from preferred vendors. The built-in dashboard provides instant troubleshooting insights that can help save you time and gives you an easy way to view large-scale site-to-site connectivity.

This overview provides a quick view into the network connectivity of your Azure and non-Azure workloads. Azure Virtual WAN offers the following advantages:

* Integrated connectivity solutions in hub and spoke - Automate site-to-site connectivity and configuration between on-premises and the Azure hub from a variety of sources, including preferred partner solutions.
* Automated spoke configuration and configuration – Connect your virtual networks and workload to the Azure hub seamlessly.
* Intuitive troubleshooting – You can see the end-to-end flow within Azure and use this information to take required actions.



## <a name="pref"></a>How does Microsoft preferred vendor integration work?

1. The branch device controller/connector is authenticated to export Site-centric information into Azure by using Azure Service Principal .
2. The branch device controller/connector obtains the Azure connectivity configuration and updates the local device. This automates the configuration download, editing, and updating of the on-premise device.
3. Once the device has the right Azure configuration, a site-to-site connection (two active tunnels) is established to the Azure WAN. Azure requires the branch device controller/connector to support IKEv2 (Details below). BGP is optional.

## Virtual WAN resources

To configure an end-to-end virtual WAN, you create the following resources:

* **WAN:** The WAN resource represents your entire network in Azure. It contains links to all hubs that you would like to have within this WAN. WANs are isolated from each other and cannot contain common hub, or connections between two hubs in different WANs.

* **Site:** The site resource represents your on-premises VPN device and its settings. A site can connect to multiple hubs. By using a preferred device vendor, you have a built-in solution to automatically export this information to Azure.

* **Hub:** A virtual hub (known also as a hub) is a VNet with specific type of gateway. The hub contains various service endpoints to enable connectivity to your on-premises network (your site). The hub is the core of your network in a region. There can only be one hub per Azure standard region. When you create a hub, it automatically creates a hub VNet and a hub gateway. 

  A hub gateway is not the same as a virtual network gateway that you use for ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway. You don't create a Site-to-Site connection from your on-premises site to your VNet, rather, you create a Site-to-Site connection to the hub. The traffic always goes through the hub gateway. This lets your VNets take advantage of scaling through the hub and the VNets do not need their own virtual network gateway.

* **Hub virtual network connection:** This resource is used to connect the hub seamlessly to your virtual network. At this time, you can only connect to virtual networks that are within the same hub region.
