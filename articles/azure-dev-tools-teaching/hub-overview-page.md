# What is Azure Education Hub? 

Your main landing page in the Education Hub is the Overview page. This page contains all
relevant information on your Academic Grant – the number of classes you have established,
your total running credit allocated and used from those classes. It also displays shortcuts to
other benefits provided by the Education Hub: Software, Learning and Quickstart Templates.

## <article body>

<!---
After the intro, you can develop your overview by discussing the features that answer the "Why should I care" question with a bit more depth.
Be sure to call out any basic requirements and dependencies, as well as limitations or overhead.
Don't catalog every feature, and some may only need to be mentioned as available, without any discussion.

## <Top task>

<!---Suggested:
An effective way to structure you overview article is to create an H2 for the top customer tasks identified in milestone one of the [Content + Learning content model](contribute-get-started-mvc.md) and describe how the product/service helps customers with that task.
Create a new H2 for each task you list.
