## Solution
If you are logging in with a university email address (example: John.Smith@university.edu) you will need to create a Microsoft Account with that email address. Creating an account is free and takes just a few minutes. Having a Microsoft Account will allow you to automatically log into all your Microsoft products with a single username and password.
### Solution #
If you are logging in with a personal email address (example: John.Smith@email.com) but also have a university email address, try using the university email address. If you previously logged into your institutionâ€™s webstore with a personal email address or do not have a university email address, you will need to create or link a Microsoft Account with your personal email address.
