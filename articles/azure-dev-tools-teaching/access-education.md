To access the Education Hub, you should have already received an email notification informing you that you’ve been approved for an Academic Grant. The email contains your approved credit amount and a link to the (Education Hub)[https://aka.ms/startedu]. Most Sponsored academic offers include a Developer tier of Azure Support for free. If you have any issues with the set-up process, please contact the
(Educator Services Desk)[azuredu@microsoft.com] or contact a local Microsoft representative that you’re working with.
