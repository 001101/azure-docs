# Supported features of Azure SQL Edge Preview

This article provides details of features supported by Azure SQL Edge. Azure SQL Edge, is built on the latest versions of the Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine on Linux, and supports a subset of the features supported in SQL Server 2019 for Linux, in addition to some features that are currently not supported or available in SQL Server 2019 on Linux or on Windows. For a complete list of the features supported in SQL Server on Linux, see [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2019 on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-editions-and-components-2019). For editions and supported features of SQL Server on Windows, refer [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2019 (15.x)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-version-15).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure SQL Edge is currently in Preview and as such should NOT be used in production or pre-production environments.

## Azure SQL Edge Editions

Azure SQL Edge is available with two different editions or software plans. These editions have identical feature sets and only differ in terms of their usage rights and the amount of cpu/memory they can access on the host system.

   |**Plan**  |**Description**  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Azure SQL Edge Developer  |  Development only sku, each Azure SQL Edge Developer container is limited to up to 4 cores and 32 GB Memory  |
   |Azure SQL Edge    |  Production sku,  each Azure SQL Edge container is limited to up to 8 cores and 64 GB Memory  |

## Operating System

Azure SQL Edge containers are currently based on Ubuntu (16.04 and 18.04) and as such are only supported to run on docker hosts running Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. Azure SQL Edge can also run on other operating system hosts, for example, other distributions of Linux or on Windows (using Docker CE or Docker EE), however these configurations are not extensively tested by Microsoft.

Azure SQL Edge is currently only supported for deployment through Azure IoT Edge. For more information on the supported systems for Azure IoT Edge, refer [Azure IoT Edge supported systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/support).

The recommended configuration for running Azure SQL Edge on Windows is to configure an Ubuntu VM on the Windows host, and then run SQL Edge inside the linux VM.

## Hardware Support

Azure SQL Edge requires a 64-bit processor, which can be from Intel, AMD or ARM, with a minimum of 1 processor and 1 GM of RAM on the host. While the startup memory footprint of Azure SQL Edge is close to 500 MB, the additional memory is needed for other IoT Edge modules running on the edge device.

## Azure SQL Edge Components

Azure SQL Edge only supports the database engine and does not include support for other components available with SQL Server 2019 on Windows or with SQL Server 2019 on Linux. Specifically, Azure SQL Edge does not support SQL Server components like Analysis Services, Reporting Services, Integration Services, Master Data Services, Machine Learning Services (In-Database) and Machine Learning Server (standalone).

## Supported Features

In addition to supporting a subset of SQL Server on Linux features, Azure SQL Edge includes support for the following new features. 

1. SQL Streaming, which is based on the same engine that powers Azure Stream Analytics, provides real-time data streaming capabilities in Azure SQL Edge. 
2. New T-SQL function call Date_Bucket for Time-Series data Analytics
3. Machine Learning capabilities through the ONNX runtime, included with the SQL engine.
