# Connect data from Azure Information Protection

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

You can stream logs from [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/information-protection/) into Azure Sentinel by configuring the Azure Information Protection data connector. Azure Information Protection helps you control and secure your sensitive data, whether itâ€™s stored in the cloud or on-premises. When you connect Azure Sentinel to Azure Information Protection, you stream all the [central reporting information from Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/reports-aip) into Azure Sentinel.


## Prerequisites

- User with Global administrator, Security administrator, or Azure Information Protection Azure AD roles, and permissions to read the Log Analytics workspace that is configured for Azure Information Protection.

## Connect to Azure Information Protection

Azure Information Protection uses a Log Analytics workspace to centrally collect logging information. If this has already been [configured for Azure Information Protection analytics](/information-protection/reports-aip#configure-a-log-analytics-workspace-for-the-reports), select that workspace when you configure the data connector. If you select a different workspace, Sentinel won't be able to get the logging information from Azure Information Protection.

If a workspace isn't yet configured for Azure Information Protection analytics, you can configure it when you configure the data connector.

1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors**, and then **Azure Information Protection**.

2. On the **Azure Information Protection** blade, you see the **STATUS** displays **Not connected**. Select **Open connector page**.

3. On the next blade, in the **Configuration** section, select **Azure Information Protection** to go to Azure Information Protection analytics. 

4. If a workspace is already configured for Azure Information Protection analytics, select it.
    
    If a workspace isn't yet configured for Azure Information Protection analytics, you can configure it now by selecting an existing workspace, or by creating a new one and then selecting it.

5. When you have selected a workspace, select **OK** and the connector **STATUS** should now change to **Connected**.

6. To use the relevant schema for the Azure Information Protection reporting data, search for **InformationProtectionLogs_CL**.
