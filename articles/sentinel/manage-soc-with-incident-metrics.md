# Manage your SOC better with incident metrics

As a Security Operations Center (SOC) manager, you need to have overall efficiency metrics and measures at your fingertips to gauge the performance of your team. You'll want to see incident operations over time by many different criteria, like severity, MITRE tactics, mean time to triage, mean time to resolve, and more. Azure Sentinel now makes this data available to you with the new **SecurityIncident** table and schema in Log Analytics and the accompanying **Security operations efficiency** workbook. You'll be able to visualize your team's performance over time, and use this insight to improve efficiency. You can also use the incident table to create customized workbooks that fit your specific auditing needs and KPIs.
