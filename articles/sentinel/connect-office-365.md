# Connect data from Office 365 Logs

The [Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/) log connector provides insight into ongoing user and admin activities in **Exchange** and **SharePoint** (including **OneDrive**). This includes details of actions such as file downloads, access requests sent, changes to group events, and mailbox operations, as well as the details of the user who performed the actions. By connecting Office 365 logs to Azure Sentinel, you can view and analyze this data in your workbooks, query it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve your investigation process.

## Prerequisites

- You must have read and write permissions on your Azure Sentinel workspace.

- You must be a global administrator or security administrator on your tenant.

- Your Office 365 deployment must be on the same tenant as your Azure Sentinel workspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In order to be able to access data through the Office 365 Management Activity API, you must have **unified audit logging** enabled on your Office 365 deployment. Depending on the type of Office 365 / Microsoft 365 license you have, it may or may not be enabled by default. Consult the [**Office 365 Security and Compliance Center**](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-securitycompliance-center) to check the status of unified audit logging according to your license type.
> - You can also manually enable, disable, and check the current status of Office 365 unified audit logging. For instructions, see [**Turn Office 365 audit log search on or off**](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off).
> - See [**Office 365 management Activity API reference**](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference) for more information.


   > [!NOTE]
   > As noted above, and as you'll see on the connector page under **Data types**, the Azure Sentinel Office 365 connector currently supports the ingestion of audit logs only from Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint (including OneDrive). However, there are some (external **?**) solutions if you're interested in [protecting your **Teams** with Azure Sentinel](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/protecting-your-teams-with-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1265761). 

## Connect to Office 365

1. From the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, select **Data connectors**.

1. From the **Data connectors** list, click **Office 365**, and then the **Open connector page** button on the lower right.

1. Under the section labeled **Configuration**, mark the check boxes of the Office 365 activity logs you want to connect to Azure Sentinel, and click **Apply Changes**. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you had previously connected multiple tenants to Azure Sentinel, using an older version of the Office 365 connector which supported this, you will be able to view and modify which logs you collect from each tenant. You will not be able to add additional tenants, but you can remove previously added tenants.

1. To query Office 365 log data in Log Analytics, type `OfficeActivity` in the first line of the query window.
