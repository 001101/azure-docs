# Connect data from Office 365 Logs

The [Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/) log connector provides insight into ongoing user and admin activities in Exchange and SharePoint (including OneDrive). This includes details of actions such as file downloads, access requests sent, changes to group events, and mailbox operations, as well as the details of the user who performed the actions. By connecting Office 365 logs to Azure Sentinel, you can view and analyze this data in your workbooks, query it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve your investigation process.

> [!NOTE]
> - Office 365 logs can only be streamed into an Azure Sentinel workspace on the same tenant.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to be able to access data through the Office 365 Management Activity API, you must have **unified audit logging** enabled for your Office 365 deployment. Depending on the type of license you have, it may or may not be enabled by default. You do this by turning on the Office 365 audit log. For instructions, see [Turn Office 365 audit log search on or off](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off). See [Office 365 management Activity API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference), for more information.

## Prerequisites

- You must be a global administrator or security administrator on your tenant.
- Your tenant must have unified auditing enabled. Tenants with Office 365 E3 or E5 licenses have unified auditing enabled by default. <br>If your tenant does not have one of these licenses, you must enable unified auditing on your tenant using one of these methods:
    - [Using the Set-AdminAuditLogConfig cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-audit/set-adminauditlogconfig?view=exchange-ps) and enable the parameter “UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled”).
    - [Using the Security & Compliance Center UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance#before-you-begin).
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Currently The O365 Data Connector only captures Exchange and Sharepoint Activty automatically as mentioned on the connector page in the Data types section. We recommend you to check [this article in case you require Teams Audit data and protect Teams using Sentinel](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/protecting-your-teams-with-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1265761). 

## Connect to Office 365

1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors** and then click the **Office 365** tile.

2. If you have not already enabled it, you can do so by going to **Data Connectors** blade and selecting **Office 365** connector. Here you can click the **Open Connector Page** and under configuration section labeled **Configuration** select all the Office 365 activity logs you want to connect to Azure Sentinel. 
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you already connected multiple tenants in a previously supported version of the Office 365 connector in Azure Sentinel, you will be able to view and modify which logs you collect from each tenant. You will not be able to add additional tenants, but you can remove previously added tenants.
3. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the Office 365 logs, search for **OfficeActivity**.
