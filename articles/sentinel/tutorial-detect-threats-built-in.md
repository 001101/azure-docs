# Tutorial: Detect threats with Azure Sentinel Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

After you [connected your data sources](quickstart-onboard.md) to Azure Sentinel, you want to be notified when something suspicious happens. To enable you to do this, Azure Sentinel provides you with out-of-the-box built-in templates. these templates were deisgned by Microsoft's team of security experts and analysts based on known threats, common attack vectors, and suspicious activity escalation chains. After enabling these templates they will automaticallly search for any activity that looks susupicous across your environment. Many of the templates can be customized to search for, or filter out, activities according to your needs. The alerts generated by these templates can be converted to incidents that you can assign and use to deeply investigate anomalies and threats in your environment. 

This tutorial helps you detect threats with Azure Sentinel.

## Use out-of-the-box detections

1. To enable out-of-the-box detections, go to **Rule templates**. 

This is a list of the template types available:
[add table with list of types and considerations]
|Template type|Considerations|
|----|----|
|UEBA| For User and entity behavioral analytics templates, you can create multiple analytic detections based on each template. These templates are based on proprietary, Microsoft machine learning algorithms, so you cannot see the internal logic of how they work and when they run.| 
|Microsoft Security| Microsoft security templates generate alerts as raw data from other Microsoft security solutions, such as Microsoft Cloud App Security and Azure Advanced Threat Protection|
|Fusion|Fusion provides algorithms to aggregate incidents that would otherwise not seem suspicious and colate them for you into investagatable tasks. Fusion is enabled by default.|
|Machine Learning|When you click **Create rule** for machine learning templates, you can select a playbook to be run automatically and create multiple rules for each machine learning template with various playbooks attached.|
|Scheduled query|For scheduled query templates, you can create multiple rules  of them - they are the only ones in which you can see the logic and make changes and schedule them to run.


For each of these templates, you can click **Create rule** and it will make them active. For many you can customize them, for instance by adding playbooks for automation.
For scheduled, When you click create rule it opens the wizard and it's all filled out already and there's a query written. 
For example, you can take the signin by suspicious IP, you can create one for a suspicous user account and create another one for a suspicious IP and save them both indpendently t obe run.
After you created them, you'll see them in the activatedrules tab.



## Automate threat responses

SIEM/SOC teams can be inundated with security alerts on a regular basis. The volume of alerts generated is so huge, that available security admins are overwhelmed. This results all too often in situations where many alerts can't be investigated, leaving the organization vulnerable to attacks that go unnoticed. 

Many, if not most, of these alerts conform to recurring patterns that can be addressed by specific and defined remediation actions. Azure Sentinel already enables you to define your remediation in playbooks. It is also possible to set real-time automation as part of your playbook definition to enable you to fully automate a defined response to particular security alerts. Using real-time automation, response teams can significantly reduce their workload by fully automating the routine responses to recurring types of alerts, allowing you to concentrate more on unique alerts, analyzing patterns, threat hunting, and more.

To automate responses:

1. Choose the alert for which you want to automate the response.
1. From the Azure Sentinel workspace navigation menu, select **Analytics**.
1. Select the alert you want to automate. 
1. In the **Edit alert rule** page, under **Real-time automation**, choose the **Triggered playbook** you want to run when this alert rule is matched.
1. Select **Save**.

In addition, you can manually remediate an alert by running a playbook from inside the alert, by clicking **View playbooks** and then selecting a playbook to run. To learn how to create a new playbook or edit an existing one, see [Working with playbooks in Azure Sentinel](tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md).
