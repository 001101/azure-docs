# Tutorial: Create custom analytic rules to detect suspicious threats

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

After you [connected your data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard) to Azure Sentinel, you can create custom rules that can search for specific
criteria across your environment and generate incidents when the criteria are matched so that you can investigate them. This tutorial helps you create custom rules to detect threats with Azure Sentinel.

## Create analytic rules

You create custom analytic rules to search for the types of threats and anomalies that could be suspicious in your environment. The rule makes sure you are notified right away so that you can triage, investigate, and remediate the threats.

1. In the Azure portal under Azure Sentinel, select **Analytics**.

1. In the top menu bar, click **+Add analytic rule** and select **Custom rule**. This opens the custom rule creation wizard.

1. In the **General** tab, provide a descriptive name, and description. Set the **Alert severity** as necessary. When you create the rule you can enable it, which will cause it to run immediately after you finish creating it. If you create it as disabled, the rule will be added to your **Active rules** tab and you can enable it from there when you need it.

1. In the **Settings** tab, you can either write a query directly, or create the query in Log Analytics, and then paste it into the **Search query** field. As you change and configure your query, Azure Sentinel simulates the query results in the **results preview** window on the right.  This enables you to gain understanding of how much data will be generated over a specific time interval for the alert you created. This will depend on what you set for **Run query ever** and **Lookup data from the last**. If you see that on average, your alert will be triggered too frequently, you
    will want to set the number of results higher so that it's above your average baseline.

1. Here's a sample query that would alert you when an anomalous number of resources is created in Azure Activity.

        Copy

        AzureActivity

        \| where OperationName == "Create or Update Virtual Machine" or
        OperationName == "Create Deployment"

        \| where ActivityStatus == "Succeeded"

        \| make-series dcount(ResourceId)  default=0 on EventSubmissionTimestamp in
        range(ago(7d), now(), 1d) by Caller

   > [!NOTE]
   > The query length should be between 1 to 10000 characters and cannot contain “search \*” and “union \*”.

1. Under **Query scheduling**:

    1. Set the **Run query every** field to set the Frequency for how often the query is run - as frequently as every 5 minutes or as infrequently as once a day.

    1. Set the **Lookup data from the last** field to to control the time window for how much data the query runs on - for example, it can run every hour across 60 minutes of data.

1. You can set Azure Sentinel to Stop running the query after alert is generated if you only want to get alert once after it occurs. You must set the amount of time to stop running the query, up to 24 hours.

1. Define alert trigger conditions under **Alert trigger**. This defines the conditions that trigger the alert.

1. Under Entity mapping , you can map the columns in your query to entity fields recognized by Azure Sentinel. For each field, map the relevant column in the query you created in Log Analytics, to the appropriate entity field. Each entity includes multiple fields, for example SID, GUID, etc. You can map the entity according to any of the fields, not just the upper level entity.

1. In the **Response automation tab** select any playbooks you want to run automatically when an alert is generated by the custom rule. For more information on creating and automating playbooks, see [Respond to threats](tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md).

1. Click **Review** to review all the setting for your new alert rule and then click **Create** to initialize your alert rule. After the alert is created, a custom rule is added to the table under Active analytic rules. There, you can also see the number of matches for each rule - the alerts triggered. From this list you can enable, disable, or delete each rule. You can also right-select the ellipsis (...) at the end of the row for each alert to edit, disable, clone, show matches, or delete a rule. The **Analytics** page is a gallery of all your active alert rules, including templates you enable and alert rules you create based on templates.

1. To view the results of the alert rules you create, go to the **Incidents** page, where you can triage, [investigate incidents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/tutorial-investigate-cases), and remediate the threats.

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts generated in Azure Sentinel are available through [Microsoft Graph Security](https://aka.ms/securitygraphdocs). Refer to the [Microsoft Graph Security alerts documentation](https://aka.ms/graphsecurityreferencebetadocs) for further details and integration partners.
