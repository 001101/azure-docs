# Using Azure Sentinel across workspaces and tenants

## The need to use multiple Azure Sentinel workspaces

Azure Sentinel is built on top of a Log Analytics workspace. As such, the first thing you'll do in setting up Azure Sentinel will be selecting the Log Analytics workspace you wish to work with.

You can benefit from the full Azure Sentinel experience when using a single workspace. However, there are some reasons to have multiple workspaces. The following table lists situations that may require the use of multiple Azure Sentinel workspaces, and, when possible, suggests how the requirement may be satisfied with a single workspace:

| Requirement | Description | Reduce workspace count by |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Sovereignty and regulatory compliance | A workspace is deployed in a region. If data needs to be kept in a different geography due to regulatory requirements, it needs to be split to multiple workspaces. |  |
| Data ownership | Data ownership, for example by subsidiaries or affiliated companies, is better delineated using workspace boundaries. |  |
| Multiple Azure tenants | Azure Sentinel supports collection from Microsoft and Azure resources only within an Azure AD tenant boundary. Therefore, each Azure AD tenant requires a separate workspace. |  |
|Finely granular data access control | Some organizations may need to provide access to some of the data collected by Azure Sentinel to different groups in, or outside of, the organization. For example: Provide access to resource owners to data pertaining to their resources. 
â€¢	Providing a regional or subsidiary SOC access to data relevant to their part of the organization.


If you're a managed security service provider (MSSP) and you're using [Azure Lighthouse](../lighthouse/overview.md) to manage your customers' security operations centers (SOC), you will be able to manage your customers' Azure Sentinel resources without connecting directly to the customer's tenant, from your own Azure tenant. 

## Prerequisites
- [Onboard Azure Lighthouse](../lighthouse/how-to/onboard-customer.md)
- For this to work properly, your tenant must be registered to the Azure Sentinel Resource Provider on at least one subscription. If you have a registered Azure Sentinel in your tenant, you are ready to get started. If not, select **Subscriptions** from the Azure portal, followed by **Resource providers**.  Then, from the **SOC - Resource providers** screen, search for and select `Microsoft.OperationalInsights` and `Microsoft.SecurityInsights`, and select **Register**.

## How to access Azure Sentinel from other tenants
1. Under **Directory + subscription**, select the delegated directories, and the subscriptions where your customer's Azure Sentinel workspaces are located.

1. Open Azure Sentinel. You will see all the workspaces in the selected subscriptions, and you'll be able to work with them seamlessly, like any workspace in your own tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> You will not be able to deploy connectors in Azure Sentinel from within a managed workspace. To deploy a connector, you must directly sign into the tenant on which you want to deploy a connector and authenticate there with the required permissions.
