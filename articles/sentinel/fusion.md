# Advanced multi-stage attack detection in Azure Sentinel

Based on Fusion technology, advanced multi-stage attack detection in Azure Sentinel uses machine learning algorithms that can correlate many low-fidelity alerts and events across multiple products into high-fidelity actionable incidents. Customized for each tenant, this detection not only reduces false positive rates but can also detect attacks with limited or missing information.

The incidents generated will always include two or more alerts, and be assigned high severity. For details about the alerts and scenarios supported, see the [Scenarios supported for multi-stage attack detection](#scenarios-supported-for-multi-stage-attack-detection) section on this page.

## Configuration for advanced multi-stage attack detection

This technology is enabled by default. To check the status, or to disable it because you are using an alternative solution to create incidents based on multiple alerts, use the **Analytics** blade in the Azure portal:

1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Navigate to **Azure Sentinel** > **Configuration** > **Analytics**

3. On the **Analytics** blade, locate **Advanced Multi-Stage Attack Detection** in the **NAME** column, and confirm whether the status is **Enabled** or **Disabled**.

4. To change the status, select this entry ....


## Scenarios supported for multi-stage attack detection

Using advanced multi-stage attack detection, Sentinel supports the following scenarios that combine anomalies from Azure Active Directory Identity Protection and Microsoft Cloud App Security:

- [Impossible travel to atypical location](#impossible-travel-to-atypical-location)
- [Sign-in for unfamiliar location](#sign-in-for-unfamiliar-location)
- [Sign in from infected device](#sign-in-from-infected-device)
- [Sign-in from anonymous IP address](#sign-in-from-anonymous-ip-address)
- [Sign-in from user with leaked credentials](#sign-in-from-user-with-leaked-credentials)

You must have the [Azure AD Identity Protection data connector](connect-azure-ad-identity-protection.md) and the [Cloud App Security](connect-cloud-app-security.md) connectors configured. Optionally, for additional information, the [Palo Alto Networks](connect-paloalto.md) connector.
