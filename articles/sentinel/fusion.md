# Advanced multi-stage attack detection in Azure Sentinel

Based on fusion technology, advanced multi-stage attack detection in Azure Sentinel uses machine learning algorithms that can correlate many low-fidelity alerts and events across multiple products, into high-fidelity and actionable incidents. Customized for each tenant, this detection not only reduces false positive rates but can also detect attacks with limited or missing information.

The incidents generated will always include two or more alerts, and be assigned high severity. For details about the alerts and the scenarios supported, see the [Scenarios supported for multi-stage attack detection](#scenarios-supported-for-multi-stage-attack-detection) section on this page.

## Configuration for advanced multi-stage attack detection

This technology is enabled by default in Sentinel. To check the status, or to disable it because you are using an alternative solution to create incidents based on multiple alerts, use the **Analytics** blade in the Azure portal:

1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Navigate to **Azure Sentinel** > **Configuration** > **Analytics**

3. On the **Analytics** blade, locate **Advanced Multi-Stage Attack Detection** in the **NAME** column, and confirm whether the status is **Enabled** or **Disabled**.

4. To change the status, select this entry and on the **Advanced Multi-Stage Attack Detection** blade, select **Edit**. Then, 


## Scenarios supported for multi-stage attack detection

Using advanced multi-stage attack detection, Sentinel supports the following scenarios that combine anomaly events from Azure Active Directory Identity Protection and Microsoft Cloud App Security:

- [Impossible travel to atypical location](#impossible-travel-to-atypical-location)
- [Sign-in activity for unfamiliar location](#sign-in-activity-for-unfamiliar-location)
- [Sign-in activity from infected device](#sign-in-activity-from-infected-device)
- [Sign-in activity from anonymous IP address](#sign-in-activity-from-anonymous-ip-address)
- [Sign-in activity from user with leaked credentials](#sign-in-activity-from-user-with-leaked-credentials)

You must have the [Azure AD Identity Protection data connector](connect-azure-ad-identity-protection.md) and the [Cloud App Security](connect-cloud-app-security.md) connectors configured.

In the descriptions that follow, Sentinel will display the actual value from your data that is represented on this page as variables in brackets. For example, the actual display name of an account rather than \<*account name*>, and the actual number rather than \<*number*>.
