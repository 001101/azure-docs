# Use Live Stream while hunting in Azure Sentinel to detect threats

Use Live Stream to create interactive sessions that let you test newly created queries as events occur, get notifications from the sessions when a match is found, and launch investigations if necessary. You can quickly create a Live Stream session using any log analytics query.

- Test newly created queries as events occur
    
    You can test and adjust queries without any conflicts to current rules that are being actively applied to events. After you confirm these new queries work as expected, it's easy to promote them to custom alert rules by selectng **Elevate to alert**.  

- Get notified when threats occur
    
    You can compare threat data feeds to aggregated log data and be notified when a match occurs. Threat data feeds are ongoing streams of data that are related to potential or current threats, so the notification might indicate a potential threat to your organization. Create a Live Stream session instead of a custom alert rule when you want to be notified of a potential issue without the overheads of maintaining a custom alert rule.

- Launch investigations
    
    If there is an active investigation in the organization involving an asset such as a host or user, you can view specific (or any) activity in the log data as it occurs on that asset. You can be notified when that activity occurs.


## Create a Live Stream session

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Sentinel** > **Threat management** > **Hunting**.
    
    You can create a Live Stream session from an existing hunting query, or create your session from scratch.
 
2. To create a Live Stream session from a hunting query:
    
    1. Locate the hunting query to use.
    2. Right-click the query and select **Add to Live Stream**:
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![create Live Stream session from Azure Sentinel hunting query](./media/live-stream/live-stream-from-query.png)

3. To create a Live Stream session from scratch: 
    
    1. Select the **Live Stream** tab
    2. Select **Live Stream**.
    
4. On the **Live Stream** blade, create your query, and then select **Play**.  
    
    The status bar under the command bar indicates whether your Live Stream is running or paused.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![create Live Stream session from Azure Sentinel hunting](./media/live-stream/live-stream-session.png)

## View and edit your Live Stream sessions

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Sentinel** > **Threat management** > **Hunting** > **Live Stream** tab.

2. Select the Live Stream session you want to view or edit. For example:
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![create Live Stream session from Azure Sentinel hunting query](./media/live-stream/live-stream-tab.png)

3. If you make any changes to the query, select **Play** from the command bar. To save your changes, select **Save**.

## Receive notifications when new events occur

Because Live Stream notifications for new events use Azure portal notifications, you see these notifications whenever you use the Azure portal. For example:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Azure portal notification for Live Stream](./media/live-stream/notification.png)

Select the notifications to open the **Live Stream** blade.
 
## Elevate a Live Stream session to an alert

You can promote a Live Stream session to a new alert by selecting **Elevate to alert** from the command bar on the relevant Live Stream session:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Elevate Live Stream session to an alert](./media/live-stream/elevate-to-alert.png)

This action opens the detection rule creation wizard, which is  prepopulated with the query that is associated with the Live Stream session.
