# Collect data from AWS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This article provides instructions for connecting Azure Sentinel to your existing Amazon Web Services account using the connector. This connection streams your Amazon Web Services CloudTrail logs into your Azure Sentinel workspace in just a few clicks. 
  
## How to connect Amazon Web Services to Azure Sentinel  

To stream Amazon Web Services CloudTrail logs from AWS to Azure Sentinel, you first have to download keys to your AWS instance, and then paste them in the new account you create in Azure Sentinel.

## Step 1: Download your AWS keys
  
1.  In your [Amazon Web Services console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), under **Security, Identity & Compliance**, click on **IAM**.

2.  Click on the **Users** tab and then click **Add user**.  
  
     ![AWS users](./media/connect-aws/aws-users.png "AWS users")
  
4.  In the **Details** step, provide a new user name for Azure Sentinel. Make sure that under **Access type** you select **Programmatic access** and click **Next permissions**.

5. Click on the JSON tab:

6. Paste the following script into the provided area:

    ```     
    {  
      "Version" : "2012-10-17",  
      "Statement" : [{  
          "Action" : [  
            "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails",  
            "cloudtrail:LookupEvents",  
            "cloudtrail:GetTrailStatus",  
            "cloudwatch:Describe*",  
            "cloudwatch:Get*",  
            "cloudwatch:List*",  
            "iam:List*",  
            "iam:Get*",
            "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "s3:PutBucketAcl",
            "s3:GetBucketAcl",
            "s3:GetBucketLocation"
          ],  
          "Effect" : "Allow",  
          "Resource" : "*"  
        }  
      ]  
     }  
  
    ```  

     ![AWS code](./media/connect-aws/aws-code.png "AWS code")
    
6. Click **Review policy**.

7. Provide a **Name** and click **Create policy**.

     ![AWS name policy](./media/connect-aws/aws-create-policy.png "AWS create policy")

9. Back in the **Add user** screen, refresh the list if necessary, and select the user you created, and click **Next review**.

   ![Review user policy in AWS](./media/connect-aws/aws-review-user.png "Review user in AWS")

10. If all the details are correct, click **Create user**.

    ![User permissions in AWS](./media/connect-aws/aws-user-permissions.png "Review user permissions in AWS")

11. When you get the success message, click **Download .csv** to save a copy of the new user's credentials, you need these later.

## Step 2: Set Azure Sentinel to gather the data

1. In Azure Sentinel, click **Data collection** and then select the **AWS** tile.

2. Under **Add account to Azure Sentinel integration** click **Add account**. 
1. In the **AWS account details** pane, provide the **AWS account name**, the **Access key, and the **Secret key** that you saved at the end of Step 1 and click **Connect**.
 
 
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you don't connect the same account twice, this will stop the connection from working properly.
