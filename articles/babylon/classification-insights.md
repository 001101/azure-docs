# Classification insights about your data from Project Babylon

This how-to guide describes how to access, view, and filter Babylon classification insight reports for your data in Azure Blob storage, Azure files, ADLS GEN 1, and ADLS GEN 2.

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Launch your Babylon account from Azure
> - View classification insights on your data
> - View and filter classifications
> - Learn how to review and search classifications made on your data estate

> [!NOTE]
> If you're blocked at any point in this process, send an email to BabylonDiscussion@microsoft.com for support.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Babylon insights, make sure that you've completed the following steps:

- Followed explanations about setting up Azure resources and populating the relevant accounts with your test data

- Set up and completed a scan on the test data in each data source.

For more information, see [Use the portal to scan Azure data sources (preview)](portal-scan-azure-data-sources.md).

After making sure your Azure Blob Storage is created, contains test data, and scanning test data succeeded, let's get started.

## Babylon insights

### Use Babylon insights

In Babylon, classifications are similar to subject tags, and are used to mark and identify content of a specific type that's found within your data estate during scanning.

Sensitivity labels are used to identify classification type categories within your organizational data, as well as the group the policies you want to apply to each category.

Babylon uses the same sensitive information types as Microsoft 365, allowing you to stretch your existing security policies and protection across your entire content and data estate.

**To view classification insights:**

1. Go to the **Babylon** [instance screen in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/babylonportal). Select your Babylon account.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Launch Babylon** account tile.

1. With Babylon open, select the **View insights** tile to access your insights area.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/insights/view-insights.png" alt-text="View your insights in the Azure portal":::

1. Within insights, select the **Classification and labeling** tab.
   :::image type="content" source="./media/insights/select-classification-labeling.png" alt-text="Classification and labeling blade":::

1. The main page of classification and labeling offers display tiles that show key details discovered about your scanned data over the time span.

   - The **Classified files** tile provides the number of unique files containing classifications
   - The center tile is dynamic and shows the percentage of files that were autoclassified with the most common label.
   - **Data scanned** is size of the scanned data set in the time span.
   - **Top classifications** show the number of unique files found containing the most common classifications over the time span.

1. Select the **View all classifications** link at the bottom of the **Top classifications** tile. The resulting report displays all classifications found within your data over the time period selected in the **Time** filter.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/insights/view-classifications.png" alt-text="View all classifications":::

1. Use the **Classification**, **Subscription**, and **Asset Type** filters to change your views and filter out specific classifications, subscriptions, or asset types from the report.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/insights/view-filtered-classifications.png" alt-text="View filtered classification report":::

1. Depending on how you choose to filter the classification report, the report tiles will display:

   - Top eight classifications found in the data scanned
   - Top eight classifications found by day/week/hour
   - Top eight classifications found by file type in the scanned data

### Data source drilldown

After selecting a classification, such as **credit card number**, drill down into the classification data sources to learn which of your data sources contain that specific classification.

If you have sensitive classifications, like credit card information, you'll want to make sure that data source is secured using an appropriate label with the right policies.

**Classification drilldown:**

1. Select on any classification from the list (such as **credit card number**) to drill down further into the data source and classification specifics.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/insights/view-drilldown.png" alt-text="Drilldown into the classification report":::

1. In the **Data source drilldown** list, select the **addcontenthere** data source from the list.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/insights/view-specific-source.png" alt-text="Select a specific data source in the classification report":::

1. Each data source in a classification list provides details on the **Storage account**, **Data source type**, **Subscription ID**, **size of the scanned data** as well as all **Labels** currently assigned to the data.
