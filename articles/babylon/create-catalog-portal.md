# Quickstart: Create a Babylon account

In this quickstart, you create a Babylon account.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* Your own [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant).

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.

## Configure your subscription

If necessary, follow these steps to configure your subscription to enable Babylon to run in your subscription:

   1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Subscriptions**.

   1. From the list of subscriptions, select the subscription you want to use. Administrative access permission for the subscription is required.

   1. For your subscription, select **Resource providers**. If the **Microsoft.ProjectBabylon** resource provider isn't registered, register it by selecting **Register**.

## Create a new Babylon account

1. Go to the [**Babylon accounts**](https://aka.ms/babylonportal) page in the Azure portal and select **Add** to create a new Babylon instance.

   You can add only one Babylon instance at a time.

1. If necessary, change the subscription to a subscription that's in the allow list for your preview access.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-catalog-portal/change-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the catalog creation screen with the allow-listed subscription selected.":::

1. Enter a **Babylon account name** for your catalog. Spaces and symbols aren't allowed.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Don't name your catalog with your company name or use sensitive information during the private preview. DNS names are not private, and your company's participation in the private preview might be disclosed via the DNS name.
1. Make a choice for **Location**, and then select **Next**.
1. The Azure portal will give you an opportunity to add tags. These tags are for use only in the Azure portal, not the catalog. They don't affect the catalog for the purposes of the preview.
1. Select **Review & Create**, and then select **Create**.

   It will take a few minutes to complete catalog creation. The newly created Babylon instance appears in the list on your **Babylon accounts** page.
1. When Babylon creation is finished, select **Go to resource**.

1. Select **Launch babylon account**.

If you no longer need this Babylon account, delete it with the following steps:

1. Go to the [**Babylon portal**](https://aka.ms/babylonportal) in the Azure portal.

2. Select the Babylon instance that you created at the beginning of the tutorial. Select **Delete**, enter the name of the data catalog instance, and then select **Delete**.
