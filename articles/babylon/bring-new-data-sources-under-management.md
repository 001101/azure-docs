# Bring new data sources under management

In this article, you learn how to add, view, edit, and delete data sources from the Babylon Management Center. A data source is the top-level data store you want to scan, such as:

- An ADLS Gen1.
- An ADLS Gen2.
- An Azure Blob Storage account.
- An Azure Data Explorer cluster.
- An Azure File Storage.
- An Azure SQL Server.
- A CosmosDB instance.

Data sources must be registered before they can be managed in Management Center.

## View data sources

Select **Management Center** in the left navigation pane.

The **Data sources** page appears.

:::image type="content" source="media/bring-new-data-sources-under-management/image2.png" alt-text="The 'Data sources' dialog box has options to add and edit data sources. It also has a list of data sources with check boxes, none of them checked." border="true":::

## Add a new data source

Select **+ New** to add a new data source.

'Data sources' is selected, and the right pane is the 'Data sources' dialog box. The + New option is highlighted, and data sources are listed, each with a check box. None is checked." border="true":::

**New data source** appears with a list of data source types. Select a type, and then select **Continue**.

:::image type="content" source="media/bring-new-data-sources-under-management/image4.png" alt-text="The 'New data source' dialog box is a menu of various data sources, such as Azure blob storage." border="true":::

Enter a name for your data source, and specify which one to add, in this case which Azure blob. You can use the drop-down lists to choose an instance to add, or you can specify the URI of your data instance, if it's in a different subscription.

:::image type="content" source="media/bring-new-data-sources-under-management/image5.png" alt-text="The New Azure Blob Storage dialog box has AzureBlobStorage for 'Friendly name'. The 'Enter manually' radio button is selected. Nothing is entered for Endpoint." border="true":::


Your selection now appears in the list of data sources.

## Edit a data source

Select the check box for the data source you want to edit.

:::image type="content" source="media/bring-new-data-sources-under-management/image6.png" alt-text="The 'Data Sources' dialog box has the AzureBlobStorage data source checked." border="true":::

Select **Edit** to edit the data source.

:::image type="content" source="media/bring-new-data-sources-under-management/image7.png" alt-text="In the Data Sources dialog box, the Edit button is highlighted." border="true":::

To delete one or more data sources, select their check boxes.
