# Register and scan ADLS Gen2

This article outlines how to register ADLS Gen2 as data source in Babylon and set up a scan on it.

## Supported Capabilities

The ADLS Gen2  data source supports the following functionality:

- **Full and incremental scans** to capture metadata and classification in ADLS Gen2 

- **Lineage** between data assets for ADF copy/dataflow activities


## Prerequisites

5. Provide a friendly name (E.g. Same as your ADLS resource name) and server endpoint and then click on finish to register the data source.


## Setting up authentication for a scan

The following authentication methods are supported for ADLS Gen2:

* Managed Identity
* Service principal
* Account Key
* SAS URL

#### Authentication -- setting up scan using the catalogs MSI (Managed Service Identity)

For ease and security, you may want to use the Catalog's Managed Service Identity (MSI) to authenticate with your data store.

To set up a scan using the Catalog's Managed Identity, you must *first* give it permissions (meaning add the identity to the correct role) to whatever resources you are trying to scan. This must be done *before* you set up your scan or your scan will fail.

#### Adding the catalog MSI to an Azure DataLake Gen2

You can add the Catalog's MSI at the Subscription, Resource Group, or
Resource level, depending on what you want it to have scan permissions
on.

> [!Note]
> You need to be an owner of the subscription to be able to add a managed identity on an Azure resource.

1. From the Azure portal <https://portal.azure.com/> , find either the
    Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource (e.g. an ADLS Gen2 storage
    account) that you would like to allow the catalog to scan.

1. Choose Access control (IAM)

1. The **Add role assignment** blade will open.

1. Fill in the form as follows:

    1. Under **Role**, Choose 'Storage Blob Data Reader' from the list.

        ![image alt-text](./media/register-scan-adls-gen2/image102.png)

    1. In the **Assign access to** box, select **Azure AD user, group, or service principal**. It should be the default option.

        ![image alt-text](./media/register-scan-adls-gen2/image103.png)

    1. In the **Select** box, start typing the name of *your* catalog and you should see it in the list for you to select.

        ![image alt-text](./media/register-scan-adls-gen2/image104.png)

    1. Click Save.

> [!Note]
> Once you have added the catalog's MSI on the data source, wait up to 15 minutes for the permissions to propagate before setting up a scan.

After about 15 minutes, the catalog should have the appropriate permissions to be able to scan the resource(s).

#### Authentication - setting up scan using account key

If you choose to use the account key for authorization, you can find this in the Azure portal. Search for your data source, and click on **Settings** > **Access keys**, copy the first key in the list.

#### Authentication -- setting up a scan using SAS URL

To use a SAS URL, you need to generate one. To learn more about how to do this, see this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview)

#### Authentication -- setting up scan using service principal

To use a service principal, you must first create one

To do this in the Azure portal:

1. Navigate to portal.azure.com

1. Select "Azure Active Directory" from the left-hand side menu

1. Select "App registrations"

1. Select "+ New application registration"

1. Enter a name for the "application" (the service principal name)

1. Select "Accounts in this organizational directory only (Microsoft
only -- Single Tenant)"

1. For Redirect URI select "Web" and enter any URL you want; it doesn't
have to be real or work

1. Then click on Register.

1. Copy down both the display name and the application ID

1. Add your service principal to a role on the data stores that you would like to scan. You do this in the Azure portal. For more information about service principals, see [Acquire a token from Azure AD for authorizing requests from a client application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-app).
