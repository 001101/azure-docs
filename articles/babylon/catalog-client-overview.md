Details** view for that particular asset.

If you click on the **Search** icon
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image17.png) in the upper right or press **Enter,**
the system will execute the search request and take you to the **Search
Results** page.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image18.png){

> \[!NOTE\] The results list for suggestions and user searches can
> differ slightly. This is because the results in the suggestions list
> are based on fuzzy matching, while user-initiated search results are
> based on exact matches.

### Search Criteria

Project Babylon currently supports the following style search criteria:

  Search Term                                         Finds
  --------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  hive                                                documents that contain **hive**
  \"hive database\"                                   documents that contain exactly \"**hive database**\", of the specified order **\*The number of spaces do not matter, case insensitive**
  hive database, hive OR database, hive && database   documents that contain hive or database **Always specify Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) in all caps.**
  hive AND database,hive && database                  documents that contain hive and database **Always specify Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) in all caps.**
  hive AND (database OR warehouse)                    combination
  hive NOT database                                   Assetsthat contain "hive" but do not contain "database"
  hiv\*                                               wild card, matches hiv, hive, hivbar, etc.

### Quick Filters

Quick filters are used to narrow down the search results returned by the
search APIs instantaneously before returning the matching assets to the
search result page.

### Search Quick Filter: Search by Asset type:

From the Quick Filters pane, you can either select to filter by Asset
type. The total number of assets of that type are displayed next to each
entry.  
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image19.png)

You can select one of the filters in the list and a list of matching
assets will be displayed in **Suggestions** pane.

You can also perform a search in this field by typing the partial name
of an Asset type, such as "sql", to see all types that contain that
word.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image20.png)

### Search Quick Filter: Search by Classification:

You can also choose to filter by Classification name in the same manner.
Like in the above example, you can also type a search phrase, for
example, "Bank" will filter the list to all classifications containing
the name Bank.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image21.png)

> \[!NOTE\] This list shows all matches for the Asset type, no matter
> the file type. These suggestions are fuzzy matches. Clicking on any
> asset in the **Suggestions** pane will take you to the **Asset
> Details** view where you can see more details.

### Search Quick Filter: Search by Person

On the home page, click on **Search catalog**. Specify the name of a
**Person**, e.g.Â the name of an Owner or Expert. Possible suggestions of
destined assets, if any, will be displayed in the dropdown. Click on a
suggested asset to go to its Asset Details page, or click on **All
results \>** or **Search** to perform a search for assets that contains
the specified person's name.

### Filter search results by Asset Type for Dynamic filters

Selecting an asset type filter from left nav enables additional filters
called dynamic filters that correspond to an asset type. For example,
choosing Azure SQL Database enables the dynamic filter for the Server,
Database and Schema. These options enable the user to narrow down the
search results.

    are present in the catalog, along with the total asset count below
    the asset type name.

     ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image36.png)

You can click on any asset on this page to be taken to the **Asset
Details** view.

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image37.png)

### Asset Details

The Asset Details page is a summarized view of the metadata for a
particular asset.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image38.png)

1.  Name: (for example, Customer) - This is the name of the asset.

2.  Type: (for example, Azure SQL Table) - This is the assets type.

3.  Edit, Refresh, Pin/Unpin - use these action buttons to edit data on
    an asset details page, to refresh the page to see any updated data
    or to pin or unpin the asset from the home page.

4.  Overview Tab - this is the default tab for the asset details page.
    It contains the overview information about the asset.

5.  Description - can be manually added by end users or applied using
    the API.

6.  Classifications - classifications can be added to and removed from
    the asset by clicking on the Edit button.

7.  Properties - This section contains the technical metadata for the
    asset as reported by the scanner. The properties that you see in
    this area will vary by data source. One property that is always
    shown is the **qualifiedName** , which is the fully qualified name
    (uri) for the asset in the data source.

8.  Last Updated - the date/time and user that last updated the asset in
    the catalog.

9.  Hierarchy - the hierarchy viewer shows the hierarchical relationship
    of the asset in the data source. For example, for a SQL Table, it
    will show a parent relationship to a schema, then the schemas parent
    database, and finally the database's parent SQL Server. Clicking
    anyone of these hyperlinks will take you to the asset details for
    that particular asset.

10. Glossary terms - this section shows any glossary terms that have
    been associated with this asset, along with the total number of
    terms on the asset. Each of the terms are hyperlinks, and if clicked
    will take you to the glossary term details page where you can see
    further information about the term.

### Schema Tab

This tab displays schema information of a structured file or table typed
asset. This tab is only present on these types of assets where the
schema is relevant or could be determined by the system.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image39.png)

-   The column names are sorted by ascending order on names.

-   You can click on any individual item in the **Column Name** column
    to jump to the asset details view for that column asset.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image40.png)

### Lineage Tab

The tab will display lineage for the asset, if available. Currently the
catalog only supports lineage results for Azure Data Factory **Copy**
activities and Azure Data Factory **Data Flow** activities.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image41.png)

    the node you would like to pivot on and select on the "Switch to
    asset" link that appears at the bottom:

     
     ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image49.png)

    The catalog will then load the lineage graph for that asset:

    
     ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image50.png)

### Dependency Graph

Clicking on any node will cause the graph to highlight all related
assets and processes to make it easy to trace dependencies.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image51.png)

If needed, you can rearrange any nodes in the graph by dragging them to
another spot in the canvas. This can make it easier to see nodes that
may be covered up.

You can also view columns and column level lineage for non-binary assets
(Ex: SQL table)

By clicking on "Expand to view the columns"

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image52.png)

The column pane will open which allows you to choose one or more
columns.

Select the columns to see column level lineage.

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image54.png)

Hover over the selected columns to highlight them in lineage graph
 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image55.png)

### Filtering the lineage view

You can filter by either column or data asset by using the search box to
search by name

 
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image56.png)

 

For more detailed information about how lineage works, refer to the
[Catalog lineage user
guide](file:///C:\Users\nayenama\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\catalog-lineage-user-guide.md).

Access permissions
------------------

Azure Data Catalog access permissions provides a basic access
permissions infrastructure. For reasons that will eventually be resolved
that infrastructure is split into two sections. One section handles
creating/deleting catalogs and scanning. The other section handles
access to all other API endpoints.

### Azure Portal Managed Permissions

To create a catalog in the first place one must have resource creation
permissions in the resource group that the catalog is to be created in.
This is managed via the Access control (IAM) section of the resource
group the catalog is to be created in. One needs to be in the
contributor or owner roles to create a new catalog instance.

Once a catalog has been created it can be deleted by anyone who is in
the owner or contributor role on the catalog itself.

For general information on how to add someone to a contributor or owner
role on a resource group please see [Role Based Access Control
Assignment
Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

One additional capability handled in the Azure Portal is that in order
to be able to scan content a user must be in the contributor or owner
role on the catalog itself. Note that those who would
create/update/delete scans need to actually be in two roles. The owner
or contributor role in the Azure Portal and the Catalog Admin or Data
Source Admin roles in the Azure Data Catalog Portal. For details on how
to get someone into both roles please see section 8.3.

## Annotation Management

> [!NOTE]
> This section was written based on ADC Gen 2 and is not yet updated. However, the general steps are similar. You might find wordings and screenshots are different in your Babylon account. If you're blocked at any point, send an email to BabylonDiscussion\@microsoft.com.

The catalog provides a set of annotations that can be used to curate
assets to make them more discoverable and so that they can be used for
policy and other scenarios.

### Classifications

One type of annotation in the catalog is a Classifications.

A classification is a piece of metadata which is intended on classifying
what type of data exists in the file. For example, an email address, a
phone number, etc.

Out of the box, the system provides a default list of classifications.
You can view this full list of classifications in the Classification
quick filter from the search box on the home page.

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image91.png)
 

Any of these classifications can be manually applied to assets at the
file level or at the column level.

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image92.png)

They can also be automatically applied by the catalog scanner, which
uses classification rules in order to detect when data is seen that
matches a pattern.

You will likely want to define your own classifications to be used in
your catalog.

To manage your classifications, head to the Management Center

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image93.png) in the left bar in the catalog UX.

Click on
 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image94.png) to get to the classification management
screen

There are two tabs, Custom and System.

Starting with the System tab, you will see the full list of system
classifications.

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image95.png)

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image96.png)

These classifications are read-only and cannot be edited or deleted from
your catalog.

If you click the Custom tab, you will see your custom classifications
(if there are any)

### Create a custom classification

Click on New:

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image97.png)

The Add new classification screen appears. Provide a unique name for
your classification:

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image98.png)

We suggest that you use your company name as a top level namespace to
organize your classifications and to maintain uniqueness. For example,
`CONTOSO.CUSTOMERID`.

The name must start with a letter followed by a sequence of letters,
numbers, period (.) or underscore (\_) characters. It can be upper or
lowercase and must be unique in your catalog.

Notice that the Friendly name is auto created by the system as you type.
This friendly name is what is shown on the actual classification tag in
the UX in order to improve readability

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image99.png)

The rule being used is that the name will be trimmed to the last two
segments of the namespace, the casing gets changed to first letter is
capitalized, and the rest lower cased. All underscores are replaced by
spaces.

For example, if you created a classification name of
`CONTOSO.FINANCE.ACCOUNT_ID`, the system would generate a friendly name
of Finance.Account ID, which is what would show to users in the catalog.

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image100.png)

### Filter a classification list

You can use the Filter by name field to quickly get to a custom
classification, which helps if you have a long list.

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image101.png)

### Delete a classification

To delete a classification, select the checkbox next to the
classification and click the delete button

 ![Screenshot](./media/catalog-client-overview/image102.png)

Connection to Azure Data Factory (ADF)
--------------------------------------

This section explains how to connect ADF to import data lineage
generated by ADF copy and dataflow activities into ADC catalog. For ADF
to successfully communicate lineage information to a catalog instance
the ADF must authenticate itself to ADC using an identity that ADC
recognizes.

### View existing connections

At a given time, more than one ADF can connect to a catalog and push
lineage information. Follow below steps to see the list of ADF that are
connected to the catalog.

1.  Click **Management center**

2.  Click **Data factory connection**

-   Data factory connection tile

3.  Data factory connection list

-   ![Data factory connection
    list](./media/catalog-client-overview/image107.png)



 

Status explanation

-   **Connected**: the data factory is successfully connected to current
    data catalog.

-   **Disconnected**: the data factory still has access to the catalog,
    but it's connected to other catalog, which means data lineage won't
    be reported to current data catalog automatically.

-   **Cannot** **access**: the current user does not have access to the
    data factory so we cannot get the connection status.

### New data factory connection

1.  Click **+ New** to create a data factory connection

2.  Select data factories from the list, which can be filtered by
    subscription name. Some options are disable because the data factory
    is already connected to current catalog, or the data factory doesn't
    have MSI (only for data factories created before ADF GA).

-   \[!NOTE\] You can only select less than 50 data factories one
    time \> due to limitations. If you want to select all data
    factories \> regardless of the throttling, append this feature flag
    after \> catalog URL: `?``feature``.dataFactoryLimit``=unlimited.`

    [https://adc.azure.com/catalog/\<mycatalog\>/management/dataFactoryConnection/connectionsList?**feature.dataFactoryLimit=unlimited**](https://adc.azure.com/catalog/%3cmycatalog%3e/management/dataFactoryConnection/connectionsList?feature.dataFactoryLimit=unlimited)*

3.  Click **OK**.

4.  If some of the selected data factories are already connected to
    other catalog, it will pop up a dialog to let customers confirm the
    reconfiguration.

    -   Click **Cancel** if the data factory should not be redirected
        from former catalog to current catalog.

    -   Click **Continue** if the data factory can be disconnected from
        former catalog and connect to current catalog.

5.  Customers will get notified when connections are established.
