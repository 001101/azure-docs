2. Hit **continue** once the connection is successful. 

### Set scan trigger
> [!NOTE] 
> Once means no schedule, which is an indication to the system that the scan should only run once. Recurring allows you to create a schedule the system should run the scan according to. The first execution of the scan will begin on the start date and time provided. Options include Monthly or Weekly scans.

1. You have the option to scan once or set up a recurring scan where you pick a date and time to run the scan periodically.

2. You can select the time it starts at and define the recurrence for a particular day of the month, and a time on that day of your choosing. 

3. Choose to specify an end date or not (meaning the recurrence of the scan will happen indefinitely).

4. Set up a trigger on a weekly cadence with an option to choose the day of the week.

### Set scan rule set
Select a scan rule set to be used by your scan from the list of available<br />

### Edit a scan
Select a scan and click Edit to edit the selected scan. You can only edit one scan at a time.

### Remove a scan
To remove a scan, select one or more scans from the list, then click Remove.

### Scan history
Click on any scan in the list to get to the scan history page. This page will show you whether your scan was schedule or manual, how many assets had classifications applied, how many total assets were discovered, the start and end time of the scan and the total duration.

### Run a scan manually
From the Scan History page, you can choose Run Scan now to launch a new scan immediately. This action will run a full scan, not an incremental scan.

Then click Cancel Scan to stop all the selected scans from running.
