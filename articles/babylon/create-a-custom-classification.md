# Create a custom classification

This article describes how you can create custom Azure Babylon classifications to define data types in your data estate that are unique to your organization.

## Default classifications

By default, the catalog provides a large set of default classifications that represent typical personal data types that you might have in your data estate. In addition to these default classifications, you can define your own custom classifications to support your data estate.

To display the default classifications, select the **System** tab on the **Classifications** page.

## Steps to create a custom classification

To create a custom classification:

1. From your Azure Babylon account page, select **Launch Babylon account**, and then select **Management Center**.

1. On the **Add new classification** page, give your classification a **Name** and a **Description**.

   It's a good practice to use a name-spacing convention, such as *&lt;your company name>.<classification name&gt;*. The Microsoft system classifications are grouped under the reserved MS.Namespace, for example, **MS.GOVERNMENT.US.SOCIAL\_SECURITY\_NUMBER**.

1. When you enter a **Name**, the system enforces that your name starts with a letter followed by a sequence of letters, numbers, period (.) or underscore (_) characters. No spaces are allowed.

   As you type, the UX automatically generates and displays the friendly name. This friendly name is what users see when you apply it to an asset in the catalog.

   To keep the friendly name short, the system creates it based on the following logic:

   - All but the last two segments of the namespace are trimmed.

   - The casing is adjusted so that the first letter of each word is capitalized.

   - All underscores (\_) are replaced with spaces.

   For example, if you named your classification **CONTOSO.HR.EMPLOYEE_ID**, the friendly name is stored in the system as **Hr.Employee ID**.

1. Select **OK**.

   Your new classification is added to your classification list.

1. To find your new custom classification, select the **Custom** tab on the **Classifications** page.

1. Select the new classification in the custom classifications list.

   The classification details page opens. Here, you find all the details about the classification. These details include the instances count, formal name, associated custom classification rules (if any), and the names of the owners.
