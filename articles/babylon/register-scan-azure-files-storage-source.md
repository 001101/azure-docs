## Create and run a scan
After you have setup your authentication type, click Continue. The next screen is where you set your scan trigger, telling the system how often you would like to scan.

> [!NOTE] 
> Once means no schedule, which is an indication to the system that the scan should only run once. Recurring allows you to create a schedule the system should run the scan according to. The first execution of the scan will begin on the start date and time provided. Options include Monthly or Weekly scans.

Here are some examples of triggers that are set up on a monthly cadence below. You can select the time it starts at and define the recurrence for a particular day of the month, and a time on that day of your choosing. You can also choose to specify an end date or not (meaning the recurrence of the scan will happen indefinitely).

You can also set up a trigger on a weekly cadence with an option to choose the day of the week.

**Set scan rule set**
Select a scan rule set to be used by your scan from the list of available<br />

**Edit a scan**
Select a scan and click Edit to edit the selected scan. You can only edit one scan at a time.

**Remove a scan**
To remove a scan, select one or more scans from the list, then click Remove.

**Scan history**
Click on any scan in the list to get to the scan history page. This page will show you whether your scan was schedule or manual, how many assets had classifications applied, how many total assets were discovered, the start and end time of the scan and the total duration.

**Running a scan manually**
From the Scan History page, you can choose Run Scan now to launch a new scan immediately. This action will run a full scan, not an incremental scan.

**Cancelling scans in progress**
Select one or more scans that are in progress by selecting the checkbox for each.

Then click Cancel Scan to stop all the selected scans from running.
