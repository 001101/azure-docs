# Classification insights about your data from Project Babylon 

This how-to guide provides an explanation of how to access, view and filter Babylon security insights in the form of classification reporting on your data in Azure Blob storage, Azure file, ADLS GEN 1, ADLS GEN 2, and Amazon S3 buckets. Make sure you've followed the explanations about [setting up Azure resources](./scan-azure-data-sources-portal.md), [setting up Amazon S3 buckets](./setup-configuration-connector-amazon-s3.md), and populating the relevant accounts with your test data before getting starting with Babylon insights. You'll also need to set up and complete a scan on the test data in each data source before you begin. Follow the instructions for scanning test data in [Azure resources](./scan-azure-data-sources-portal.md), and [Amazon S3 buckets](./setup-configuration-connector-amazon-s3.md). 

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> Launch your Babylon account from Azure. 
> View insights on your data. 
> View and filter classifications.
> Learn how to review and search classifications made on your data estate. 


After making sure your Babylon source data was created, contains test data, and a test scan was completed, let's get started.

## Babylon insights

### Use Babylon insights

In Babylon, classifications are similar to subject tags and are used to mark and identify content of a specific type found within your data estate during scanning. Sensitivity labels are used to identify the categories of classification types within your organizational data, and the group the policies you wish to apply to each category. Babylon makes use of the same sensitive information types as Microsoft 365, allowing you to stretch your existing security policies and protection across your entire content and data estate.  

1. Go to the **Babylon** [instance screen in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/babylonportal). Select your Babylon account.

1. When the Babylon blade is open, click the **Launch Babylon** account tile in the **Get Started** section.

1. With Babylon open, click the **View insights** tile to access your insights area.

1. Within insights, select the **Classification and labeling** blade.

1. The main page of classification and labeling offers display tiles that show key details discovered about your scanned data over the time span. The **Classified files** tile provides the number of unique files containing classifications, while the center tile is dynamic and shows the percentage of files which were auto-classified with the most common label. **Data scanned** is size of the scanned data set in the time span, and **Top classifications** shows the number of unique files found containing the most common classifications over the time span.


1. Select the **View all classifications** link at the bottom of the **Top classifications** tile. The resulting report displays all classifications found within your data over the time period selected in the **Time** filter.

1. Use the **Classification**, **Subscription**, and **Asset Type** filters to change your views and filter out specific classifications, subscriptions or asset types from the report.

    ![View filtered classification report](./media/insights/view-filtered-classifications.png)

1. Depending on how you choose to filter the classification report, the report tiles will display: 

    - Top eight classifications found in the data scanned
    - Top eight classifications found by day/week/hour
    - Top eight classifications found by file type in the scanned data

### Data source drilldown 

After selecting a classification in the previous instructions (such as **credit card number**), you can drill down into the data sources of the classifications found to learn which of your data sources contains that specific classification. In the case of sensitive classifications, like credit card information, you'll want to make sure that data source is secured using an appropriate label with the right policies.

**Classification drill down:** 

1. Click on any classification from the list (such as **credit card number**) to drill down further into the data source and classification specifics. 

    ![Drilldown into the classification report](./media/insights/view-drilldown.png)

1. In the **Data source drilldown** list, select the **addcontenthere** data source from the list. 

    ![Select a specific data source in the classification report](./media/insights/view-specific-source.png)

1. Each data source in a classification list provides details on the **Storage account**, **Data source type**, **Subscription ID**, **size of the scanned data** as well as all **Labels** currently assigned to the data.
