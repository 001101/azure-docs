# Provide feedback on Babylon preview

Babylon Private Preview is a great opportunity for you to let us know what is and is not working well for you. By providing direct feedback to Microsoft, you can help us understand what Project Babylon functionality you value and what we need to change.

You can provide feedback in any of three ways:

1.  Send email to *BabylonDiscussion@Microsoft.com*. You message goes directly to the entire Babylon team.

2.  Use the feedback feature in the Babylon user interface.

3.  Participate in Microsoft-sponsored research studies, scheduled
    webinars, and other feedback opportunities.

## Use the smiley face in the feedback feature

The two smiley face options suggest the type of feedback you might want to provide:

* Provide specific feedback on what works well for you.
