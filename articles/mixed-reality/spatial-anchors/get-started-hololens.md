# Quickstart: Create a HoloLens app with Spatial Anchors

[Spatial Anchors](overview.md) is a cross-platform developer service that makes it easy for you to create
Mixed Reality experiences.â€‹ This quickstart shows how to create a HoloLens DirectX C++/WinRT app using spatial anchors. When you're finished,
you'll have an HoloLens app that can save and recall a spatial anchor.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, here's a list of prerequisites:

- A Windows machine with <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2017</a> installed with the **Universal Windows Platform development** workload and the **Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0)** component.
- The [C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX)](https://aka.ms/cppwinrt/vsix) for Visual Studio should be installed from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
- A HoloLens device with [developer mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-visual-studio) enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> This article requires a HoloLens device with the [Windows 10 October 2018 Update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/02/find-out-whats-new-in-windows-and-office-in-october/) (also known
> as RS5). To update to the latest release on HoloLens, open the **Settings** app, go to **Update & Security**, then select
