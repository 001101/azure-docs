# Quickstart: Create an Android app with Spatial Anchors

[Spatial Anchors](../overview.md) is a cross-platform developer service that makes it easy for you to create
Mixed Reality experiences. This quickstart shows how to create an Android app using spatial anchors. When you're finished,
you'll have an ARCore Android app that can save and recall a spatial anchor.
