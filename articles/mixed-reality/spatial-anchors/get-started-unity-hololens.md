# Quickstart: Create a HoloLens Unity app using Spatial Anchors

[Spatial Anchors](overview.md) is a cross-platform developer service that makes it easy for you to create
Mixed Reality experiences.â€‹ This quickstart shows how to create a HoloLens Unity app using spatial anchors. When you're finished,
you'll have an HoloLens app built with Unity that can save and recall a spatial anchor.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, here's a list of prerequisites:

- A Windows machine with <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank">Unity 2018.2+</a> and <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2017</a> installed with the **Universal Windows Platform development** workload.
- A HoloLens device.

## Open the sample project in Unity

Clone the [samples repository](https://mixedrealitycloud.visualstudio.com/_git/Mixed%20Reality%20Cloud%20Preview) by running the following command:

```console
git clone https://mixedrealitycloud.visualstudio.com/Mixed%20Reality%20Cloud%20Preview/_git/Mixed%20Reality%20Cloud%20Preview mixedreality.spatialanchors.samples
```

Open Unity and open the project at the `unity\samples` folder.

Open **Build Settings** by selecting **File** -> **Build Settings**.

In the **Platform** section, select **Universal Windows Platform**. Then, change the **Target Device** to **HoloLens**.

Select **Switch Platform** to change the platform to **Universal Windows Platform**.

Close the **Build Settings** window.

## Configure the token endpoint

In the **Project** pane, navigate to `Assets/MRCloudPlugin/Examples` and open the `AndroidMRCloudDemo.unity` scene file.

In the **Hierarchy** pane, select the **MixedRealityCloud** game object. Then, in the **Inspector** pane, enter the `Account Key` (from the Azure Active Directory App created earlier) as the value for `MR Cloud Account Key` and the `Endpoint` url (from the Spatial Anchors service created earlier) as the value for `MR Cloud Service Url`.

Save the scene either by pressing **Ctrl + S** or selecting **File** -> **Save Scene**.

## Export the HoloLens project

Open **Build Settings** by selecting **File** -> **Build Settings**.

Under **Scenes In Build**, place a check mark next to the `MRCLoudPlugin/Examples/HoloLensMRCloudDemo` scene and clear check marks from all other scenes.

Select **Build** to open a dialog. Then, select a folder to export the HoloLens Visual Studio project.

When the export is complete, a folder will be displayed, which contains the exported HoloLens project.

## Open the HoloLens Visual Studio project

In the folder, double-click on `HelloAR U3D.sln` to open the project in Visual Studio.

Change the **Solution Configuration** to **Release**, change **Solution Platform** to **x86**, and select **Device** from the deployment target options.

Power on the HoloLens device, sign in, and connect it to the PC using a USB cable.

Press **F5** to build, deploy, and launch the app on the HoloLens. The app will start with the Visual Studio debugger attached.

Follow the instructions in the app to place and recall an anchor.

In Visual Studio, stop the app by either selecting **Stop Debugging** or pressing **Shift + F5**.
