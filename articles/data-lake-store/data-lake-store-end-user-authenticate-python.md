# End-user authentication with Data Lake Store using Python

In this article, you learn about how to use the Python SDK to do end-user authentication with Azure Data Lake Store. End-user authentication can further be split into two categorie:

* End-user authentication without multi-factor authencation
* End-user authentication with multi-factor authentication

Both these options are discussed in this article. For service-to-service authentication with Data Lake Store using Python, see [Service-to-service authentication with Data Lake Store using Python](data-lake-store-service-to-service-authenticate-pythonl.md).

## Prerequisites

* **Python**. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This article uses Python 3.5.2.

* **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

* **Create an Azure Active Directory "Native" Application**. You must have completed the steps in [End-user authentication with Data Lake Store using Azure Active Directory](data-lake-store-end-user-authenticate-using-active-directory.md).

## Install the modules

To work with Data Lake Store using Python, you need to install three modules.

* The `azure-mgmt-resource` module. This includes Azure modules for Active Directory, etc..
* The `azure-mgmt-datalake-store` module. This includes the Azure Data Lake Store account management operations. For more information on this module, see [Azure Data Lake Store Management module reference](http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sample_azure-mgmt-datalake-store.html).
* The `azure-datalake-store` module. This includes the Azure Data Lake Store filesystem operations. For more information on this module, see [Azure Data Lake Store Filesystem module reference](http://azure-datalake-store.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Use the following commands to install the modules.

```
pip install azure-mgmt-resource
pip install azure-mgmt-datalake-store
pip install azure-datalake-store
```

## Create a new Python application

1. In the IDE of your choice create a new Python application, for example, **mysample.py**.

2. Add the following lines to import the required modules

	```
	## Use this only for Azure AD service-to-service authentication
	from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

	## Use this only for Azure AD end-user authentication
	from azure.common.credentials import UserPassCredentials

	## Use this only for Azure AD multi-factor authentication
	from msrestazure.azure_active_directory import AADTokenCredentials

	## Required for Azure Data Lake Store account management
	from azure.mgmt.datalake.store import DataLakeStoreAccountManagementClient
	from azure.mgmt.datalake.store.models import DataLakeStoreAccount

	## Required for Azure Data Lake Store filesystem management
	from azure.datalake.store import core, lib, multithread

	# Common Azure imports
	from azure.mgmt.resource.resources import ResourceManagementClient
	from azure.mgmt.resource.resources.models import ResourceGroup

	## Use these as needed for your application
	import logging, getpass, pprint, uuid, time
	```

3. Save changes to mysample.py.

### End-user authentication without multi-factor authentication

#### For account management

Use this to authenticate with Azure AD for account management operations on Data Lake Store such as create Data Lake Store account, delete Data Lake Store account, etc. You must provide username and password for an Azure AD user. Note that the user should not be configured for multi-factor authentication.

    user = input('Enter the user to authenticate with that has permission to subscription: ')
	password = getpass.getpass()

	credentials = UserPassCredentials(user, password)

#### For filesystem operations

Use this to authenticate with Azure AD for filesystem operations on Data Lake Store such as create folder, upload file, etc. Use this with an existing Azure AD **native** application. The Azure AD user you provide credentials for should not be configured for multi-factor authentication.

	tenant_id = 'FILL-IN-HERE'
	client_id = 'FILL-IN-HERE'
	user = input('Enter the user to authenticate with that has permission to subscription: ')
	password = getpass.getpass()

	token = lib.auth(tenant_id, user, password, client_id)

### End-user authentication with multi-factor authentication

#### For account management

Use this to authenticate with Azure AD for account management operations (create/delete Data Lake Store account, etc.). The following snippet can be used to authenticate your application using multi-factor authentication. Use this with an existing Azure AD "Web App" application.

	authority_host_url = "https://login.microsoftonline.com"
	tenant = "FILL-IN-HERE"
	authority_url = authority_host_url + '/' + tenant
	client_id = 'FILL-IN-HERE'
	redirect = 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob'
	RESOURCE = 'https://management.core.windows.net/'
	
	context = adal.AuthenticationContext(authority_url)
	code = context.acquire_user_code(RESOURCE, client_id)
	print(code['message'])
	mgmt_token = context.acquire_token_with_device_code(RESOURCE, code, client_id)
	credentials = AADTokenCredentials(mgmt_token, client_id)

#### For filesystem operations

Use this to authenticate with Azure AD for filesystem operations (create folder, upload file, etc.). The following snippet can be used to authenticate your application using multi-factor authentication. Use this with an existing Azure AD "Web App" application.

	token = lib.auth(tenant_id='FILL-IN-HERE')
