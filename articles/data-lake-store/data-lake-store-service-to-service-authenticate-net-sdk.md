# Service-to-service authentication with Data Lake Store using Azure Active Directory

Azure Data Lake Store uses Azure Active Directory for authentication. Before authoring an application that works with Azure Data Lake Store or Azure Data Lake Analytics, you must first decide how you would like to authenticate your application with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The two main options available are:

* End-user authentication 
* Service-to-service authentication (this article) 

Both these options result in your application being provided with an OAuth 2.0 token, which gets attached to each request made to Azure Data Lake Store or Azure Data Lake Analytics.

This article talks about how create an **Azure AD web application for service-to-service authentication**. For instructions on Azure AD application configuration for end-user authentication see [End-user authentication with Data Lake Store using Azure Active Directory](data-lake-store-end-user-authenticate-using-active-directory.md).

## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

### If you are using service-to-service authentication with client secret
The following snippet can be used to authenticate your application **non-interactively**, using the client secret / key for an application / service principal. Use this with an existing Azure AD "Web App" Application. For instructions on how to create the Azure AD web application and how to retrieve the client ID and client secret required in the snippet below, see [Create an Active Directory Application for service-to-service authentication with Data Lake Store](data-lake-store-authenticate-using-active-directory.md).

    // Service principal / appplication authentication with client secret / key
    // Use the client ID of an existing AAD "Web App" application.
    SynchronizationContext.SetSynchronizationContext(new SynchronizationContext());

    var domain = "<AAD-directory-domain>";
    var webApp_clientId = "<AAD-application-clientid>";
    var clientSecret = "<AAD-application-client-secret>";
    var clientCredential = new ClientCredential(webApp_clientId, clientSecret);
    var creds = await ApplicationTokenProvider.LoginSilentAsync(domain, clientCredential);

### If you are using service-to-service authentication with certificate

As a third option, the following snippet can be used to authenticate your application **non-interactively**, using the certificate for an Azure Active Directory application / service principal. Use this with an existing [Azure AD Application with certificates](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal.md).

    // Service principal / application authentication with certificate
    // Use the client ID and certificate of an existing AAD "Web App" application.
    SynchronizationContext.SetSynchronizationContext(new SynchronizationContext());

    var domain = "<AAD-directory-domain>";
    var webApp_clientId = "<AAD-application-clientid>";
    var clientCert = <AAD-application-client-certificate>
    var clientAssertionCertificate = new ClientAssertionCertificate(webApp_clientId, clientCert);
    var creds = await ApplicationTokenProvider.LoginSilentWithCertificateAsync(domain, clientAssertionCertificate);



## Next steps
In this article you created an Azure AD web application and gathered the information you need in your client applications that you author using .NET SDK, Java SDK, etc. You can now proceed to the following articles that talk about how to use the Azure AD web application to first authenticate with Data Lake Store and then perform other operations on the store.

* [Get started with Azure Data Lake Store using .NET SDK](data-lake-store-get-started-net-sdk.md)
* [Get started with Azure Data Lake Store using Java SDK](data-lake-store-get-started-java-sdk.md)

This article walked you through the basic steps needed to get a user principal up and running for your application. You can look at the following articles to get further information:
* [Use PowerShell to create service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal)
* [Use certificate authentication for service principal authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal#create-service-principal-with-certificate)
* [Other methods to authenticate to Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-authentication-scenarios)
