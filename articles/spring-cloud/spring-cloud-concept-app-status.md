# Understanding app status for Azure Spring Cloud

The Azure Spring Cloud UI delivers a lot of information about the status of running applications.  There is an **Apps** option for each resource group in a subscription that displays general status of application types.  For each application type there is an **Application instances** display.

## Apps status
To view general status of an application type, select **Apps** in the left navigation pane of a resource group. This will display the status of the deployed app and its discovery status:
* DeploymentStatus: Whether the app is deployed or its state.
* DiscoveryStatus: The registered status of the app in Eureka server, which is the same as the definition in Eureka.
