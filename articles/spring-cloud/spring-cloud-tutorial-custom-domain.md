# Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure Spring Cloud
This example imports certificate to vault and then applies the cert to domain.

## Prerequisites
* An application deployed to Azure Spring Cloud (see[Quickstart: Launch an existing Azure Spring Cloud application using the Azure portal](articles\spring-cloud\spring-cloud-quickstart-launch-app-portal.md), or use an existing app)
* A domain name with access to the DNS registry for domain provider such as GoDaddy.
*  A private certificate from a third-party provider. The certificate must match the domain.

## Import Certificate 
 Upload your certificate to key vault, then import it to Azure Spring Cloud. See [What is Azure Key Vault?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview) is an Azure service that helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. It's the storage of choice for Azure Spring Cloud certificates.

 ## Add SSL Binding 
In the custom domain table, select **Add ssl binding**.
