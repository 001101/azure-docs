# Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure Spring Cloud
This example imports a certificate from a third-party provider to the key vault and then applies the certificate to a domain.

## Prerequisites
* An application deployed to Azure Spring Cloud (see [Quickstart: Launch an existing Azure Spring Cloud application using the Azure portal](spring-cloud-quickstart-launch-app-portal.md), or use an existing app).
* A domain name with access to the DNS registry for domain provider such as GoDaddy.
*  A private certificate from a third-party provider. The certificate must match the domain.

## Import Certificate 
 Upload your certificate to key vault, then import it to Azure Spring Cloud.  [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview) is an service that safeguards cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. It is the storage of choice for Azure Spring Cloud certificates.
 For information about importing a certificate, see [Import a certificate
](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificate-scenarios#import-a-certificate).

 ## Add SSL Binding 
In the custom domain table, select **Add ssl binding**.
