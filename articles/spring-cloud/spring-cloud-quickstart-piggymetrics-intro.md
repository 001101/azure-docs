# Quickstart - Introduction to Piggymetrics sample app

Piggymetrics is a sample app used in examples that illustrate deployment to Azure Spring Cloud.  This proof-of-concept application is a simple way to deal with personal finances.  It demonstrates the microservice architecture pattern, including a user interface.  The following sections describe Piggymetrics services.

To follow the Azure Spring Cloud deployment examples, you only need the location of the source code, which is provided as needed.

## Functional services
PiggyMetrics is decomposed into three core microservices. All of them are independently deployable applications, organized around business domains.

* **Account service**: Contains general user input logic and validation: incomes/expenses items, savings, and account settings.
* **Statistics service**: Performs calculations on major statistics parameters and captures time series for each account. Datapoint contains values, normalized to base currency and time period. This data is used to track cash flow dynamics in account lifetime.
* **Notification service**: Stores users contact information and notification settings, such as remind and backup frequency. Scheduled worker collects required information from other services and sends e-mail messages to subscribed customers.

## Infrastructure services
There are several common patterns in distributed systems that help make core services work. Spring cloud provides powerful tools that enhance Spring Boot applications behavior to implement those patterns: 

* **Config service**: Spring Cloud Config is a horizontally scalable centralized configuration service for distributed systems. It uses a pluggable repository that currently supports local storage, Git, and Subversion.
* **Auth service** Authorization responsibilities are completely extracted to a separate server, which grants OAuth2 tokens for the backend resource services. Auth Server does user authorization and secure machine-to-machine communication inside a perimeter.
* **API Gateway**: The three core services expose an external API to client. In real-world systems, this number can grow very quickly with system complexity. Hundreds of services might be involved in rendering of one complex webpage. The API Gateway is a single entry point into the system, used to handle requests and route them to the appropriate backend service or by invoke multiple backend services, aggregating the results. 

## Sample usage of Piggymetrics
