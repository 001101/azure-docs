# Metrics for Azure Spring Cloud

Azure Metrics explorer is a component of the Microsoft Azure portal that allows plotting charts, visually correlating trends, and investigating spikes and dips in metrics. Use the metrics explorer to investigate the health and utilization of your resources. 

In Azure Spring Cloud, there are two view point for metrics.
* Charts in each application overview page
* Common metrics page

 ![Metrics Charts](media/metrics/metrics-1.png)

Charts in the application **Overview** provides quick status check for each application. The common **Metrics** page contains all metrics available for reference. You can build your own charts in the common metrics page and pin them in Dashboard.

## Application overview page
Select an app in **App Management** to find charts in the overview page.  

 ![Application Metrics Management](media/metrics/metrics-2.png)

Each application's **Application Overview** page presents a metrics chart that allows you to perform a quick status check of your application.  

 ![Application Metrics Overview](media/metrics/metrics-3.png)

We provide 5 charts with metrics updated every minute for the following:

* **Http Server Errors**: Error count for HTTP requests to your app.
* **Data In**: Bytes received by your app.
* **Data Out**: Bytes sent to your app.
* **Requests**: Requests received by your app.
* **Average Response Time**: Average response time from your app.

You can select a time range for the chart between 1 hour up to 7 Days.

## Common metrics page

The **Metrics** in the left navigation pane links to the common metrics page.

First, select metrics to view:

![Select Metric View](media/metrics/metrics-4.png)

Next, select aggregation type for each metric:

![Metric Aggregation](media/metrics/metrics-5.png)

The aggregation type indicates how to aggregate time. There is one metric point every minute.
* Total: Sum all metrics as target output.
* Average: Use the Average value in the period as target output.
* Max/Min: Use the Max/Min value in the period as target output.

Time range to show can also be modified.  The time range can be chosen from last 30 minutes to last 30 days, or a custom time range.

![Metric Modification](media/metrics/metrics-6.png)

The default view includes all of an Azure Spring Cloud service's application's metrics together. Metrics of one app or instance can be filtered in the display.  Click **Add filter**, set the property to **App**, and select the target application you want to monitor in the **Values** text box. 

You can use 2 kinds of filters (properties):
* App: filter by app name
* Instance: filter by app instance

![Metric Filters](media/metrics/metrics-7.png)

YOu can also use the **Apply splitting** option, which will draw multiple lines for one app:

>[!TIP]
> You can build your own charts in metrics page and pin them to your **Dashboard**. Start by naming your chart.  Next, select **Pin to dashboard in the top right corner**. You can now check on your application at your Portal **Dashboard**.

## User portal metrics options

The following table shows the available metrics and details.

    <td>system.cpu.usage</td>
    <td>Percent</td>
    <td>Recent CPU usage for the whole system. This value is a double in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. All values betweens 0.0 and 1.0 are possible depending of the activities going on in the system. If the system recent cpu usage is not available, the method returns a negative value.</td>

    <td>Percent</td>
    <td>Recent CPU usage for the Java Virtual Machine process. This value is a double in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the JVM process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the JVM 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the JVM include the application threads as well as the JVM internal threads. All values betweens 0.0 and 1.0 are possible depending of the activities going on in the JVM process and the whole system. If the Java Virtual Machine recent CPU usage is not available, the method returns a negative value.</td>
