# How to use permissions in Azure Spring Cloud
This article shows you how to create custom roles that delegate permissions to Azure Spring Cloud resources. Custom roles extend [built-in Azure roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) with various stock permissions.

We will implement the following custom roles:

* **Developer role**: 
    * Deploy
    * Test
    * Restart apps
    * Can apply and make changes to app configurations in the git repository
    * Can get the log stream
* **Ops engineer role**: 
    * Restart apps
    * Get log streams
    * Cannot make changes to apps or configurations
* **Ops - Site Reliability Engineering**: 
    * Restart apps
    * Get log streams
    * Cannot make changes to apps or configurations
* **Azure Pipelines/Jenkins/Github Actions role**:
    * Can perform create, read, update, delete operations
    * Can create and configure everything in Azure Spring Cloud and apps within service instance: Azure Pipelines, Jenkins or GitHub Actions, using Terraform or ARM Templates

## Define Developer role

The developer role includes permissions to restart apps and see their log streams, but cannot make changes to apps, configuration.

### Navigate subscription and resource group Access control (IAM)

Follow these steps to start defining a role.

1. In the Azure portal, open the subscription and resource group where you want the custom role to be assignable.
2. Open **Access control (IAM)**.
3. Click **+ Add**.

### Select the permissions:
7. In the search box, search for *Microsoft.app*.
Select *Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud*.

   ![Select Azure Spring Cloud](media/spring-cloud-permissions/spring-cloud-permissions.png)

From: **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring**, select:

* Read : Get Azure Spring Cloud service instance

From: **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps**, select:

* Read : Read Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application

From: **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps/deployments**, select:

* Read : Read Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

* Other : Start Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

* Other : Stop Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

* Other : Restart Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

9. Review the permissions.

10. Click **Review and create**.


## Define Ops engineer role
This procedure defines a role with permissions to deploy, test, and restart Azure Spring Cloud apps.

1. Repeat the procedure to navigate subscription, resource group,and access Access control (IAM).
2. Select the permissions:

From **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring**, select:

* Read : Get Azure Spring Cloud service instance

* Other : List Azure Spring Cloud service instance test keys

From **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps/deployments**, select: 

* Other : Start Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

* Other : Stop Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

3. Click **Add**.

4. Review the permissions.

5. Click **Review and create**.

## Define Ops - Site Reliability Engineering role
This role can deploy, test, and restart apps. The role has the same permissions as Ops engineer role.

1. Repeat the procedure to navigate subscription, resource group,and access Access control (IAM).

2. Select the permissions:

From **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring**, select:

* Read : Get Azure Spring Cloud service instance

* Other : List Azure Spring Cloud service instance test keys

From **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps/deployments**, select: 

* Other : Start Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

* Other : Stop Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

3. Click **Add**.

4. Review the permissions.

5. Click **Review and create**.

## Define Azure Pipelines/Provisioning role
This Jenkins/Github Actions role can create and configure everything in Azure Spring Cloud and apps with a service instance.

## Define Pipelines role
This role is for releasing or deploying code.

1. Repeat the procedure to navigate subscription, resource group,and access Access control (IAM).

2. Open the **Permissions** options.

3. Select the permissions:
  
From: **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring**, select:
 
* Write : Create or Update Azure Spring Cloud service instance

* Read : Get Azure Spring Cloud service instance

* Other : Get Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application resource upload URL

From: **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps**, select:

* Write : Write Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application

* Delete : Delete Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application

* Read : Read Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application

* Other : Get Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application resource upload URL

From **Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps/deployments**, select:

* Delete : Delete Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

* Read : Read Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

* Other : Start Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment

* Other : Stop Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud application deployment
