# Security baseline for Azure Firewall

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview) to Azure Firewall. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Firewall. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Firewall have been excluded. To see how Azure Firewall completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Firewall security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/spreadsheets/security_baselines).



## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall is integrated with Azure Monitor for logging of traffic processed by the firewall.Additionally, use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure your network resources related to Azure Firewall.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Enable Threat intelligence-based filtering to alert and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains. Threat intelligence-based filtering can be enabled for your firewall to alert and deny traffic from/to-known malicious IP addresses and domains.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: In an Azure Firewall, a service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation.

Azure Firewall service tags can be used in the network rules destination field and define network access controls on Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules.

Additionally, customer-defined tags such as IP groups are also supported and can be used in a network rule or an application rule. FQDN tags in application rules are supported to allow the required outbound network traffic through your firewall.

Note: You cannot create your own service tag, nor specify which IP addresses are included within a tag. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.


**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources related to Azure Firewall.

Azure policy is not yet fully supported for Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall Manager can be used to achieve standardization of security configurations.

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resources Manager templates, RBAC controls, and policies, in a single blueprint definition. You can apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: You can enable and on-board log data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM for central security log management of various logs.

Activity logs can be used to audit operations on Azure Firewall to and monitor actions on resources. The activity log contains all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your resources except read operations (GET). Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

Azure Firewall also provides the following diagnostic logs to provide information on customer applications and network rules.

Application rule log: Each new connection that matches one of your configured application rules results in a log for the accepted/denied connection.

Network rule log: Each new connection that matches one of your configured network rules results in a log for the accepted/denied connection
