# Overview of the UK OFFICIAL blueprint sample

The UK OFFICIAL blueprint sample provides a set of governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
that help towards UK OFFICIAL attestation. This blueprint sample helps customers deploy a core set
of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture requiring accreditation or compliance with the UK
OFFICIAL framework. The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this
initiative and how these policies help meet various controls defined by UK OFFICIAL framework. When
assigned to an architecture, resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with
assigned policies. For more information, see [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md).
