# Overview of the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure foundation blueprint sample

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure(CAF) foundation blueprint is a set of controls to help you manage your cloud estate in alignment with the CAF.

## Architecture

The CAF foundation blueprint sample deploys recommended infrastructure resources in Azure that can
be used by organizations to put in place the foundation controls necessary to manage their cloud estate.
This sample will deploy and enforce resources, policies and templates that will allow an organization to confidently get started with Azure.

This environment is composed of several Azure services used to provide a secure, fully monitored,
enterprise-ready foundation. This environment is
composed of:

- An [Azure Key Vault](../../../../key-vault/key-vault-whatis.md) instance used to host secrets used
  for the VMs deployed in the shared services environment
- Deploy [Log Analytics](../../../../azure-monitor/overview.md) for the
    entire environment and [Storage Accounts] (../../../../storage.md) for diagnostic logging
- Deploy [Azure Security Center](../../../../security-center/security-center-intro.md),
    standard.
The blueprint also defines and deploys [Azure Policies](../../../policy/overview.md), for 
- Policies
    - Tagging (CostCenter) applied to resources groups
    - Append resources in resource group with the CostCenter Tag
    - Allowed Azure Region for Resources and Resource Groups
	- Allowed Storage Account SKUs (choose while deploying)
	- Allowed Azure VM SKUs	(choose while deploying)
	- Require Network Watch to be deployed 
	- Require Azure Storage Account Secure transfer Encryption
	- Deny resource types (choose while deploying)  
 - Initiatives
     - Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center (89 Policies)

All these elements abide to the proven practices published in the [Azure Architecture Center - Reference Architectures](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/).

> [!NOTE]
> The CAF foundation lays out a foundational architecture for workloads.
> You still need to deploy workloads behind this foundational architecture.
