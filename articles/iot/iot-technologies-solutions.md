# Overview of the collection of PaaS/SaaS technologies and solutions available in Azure IoT

Article should give an overview, then provide another level of detail on the two paths available to customers:
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): build your own application using IoT Suite, PCS, and all Technologies
- Software as a Service (SaaS): leverage another application to build a solution, for instance, IoT Central solutions.

## Solutions

Microsoft has built a portfolio that supports the needs of all customers, and enables everyone to access the benefits of digital transformation.

### Microsoft IoT Central (SaaS)

Microsoft IoT Central is a fully managed SaaS solution that is best used when you need to get started quickly with minimal IoT experience. If your business is pursuing speed over customization, SaaS models could be the perfect fit for your IoT implementation needs. 

Organizations with fewer device models, more predictable scenarios, and limited IoT/IT capabilities can now reap the benefits of IoT through a SaaS approach. Businesses that previously lacked the time, money, and expertise to develop connected products, can now get started quickly with Microsoft IoT Central. We are leading the industry in providing a mature SaaS solution that meets common IoT implementation pain points. 

- Fully managed IoT SaaS
- No cloud solution development expertise required
- Configurable to your needs
- Ideal for straightforward IoT needs

### Azure IoT Suite (PaaS)

Azure IoT Suite is a customizable PaaS solution that is best used when you need a lot of control over your IoT solution. If your business is implementing IoT for connected operations, or have very particular customization requirements for your connected products, you can have the control you need with Azure IoT Suite. 

Organizations with a large number of devices or device models, and manufacturers seeking connected factory solutions are examples of companies that can create highly customizable IoT solutions tailored to their complex needs.

- Preconfigured solutions
    - Remote monitoring
    - Connected factory
    - Predictive maintenance
    - Device simulation
- Deploy in minutes
- Accelerate time to value
- Ideal for solutions that require ultimate control

## Technologies (PaaS)

PaaS technologies that span the Azure platform.
