# Azure Defender for Key Vault

> [!NOTE]
> This service is not currently available in Azure government and sovereign cloud regions.

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that safeguards encryption keys and secrets like certificates, connection strings, and passwords. 

## Protecting your vaults

Enable **Azure Defender for Key Vault** for Azure-native, advanced threat protection for Azure Key Vault, providing an additional layer of security intelligence. 

Azure Defender detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit Key Vault accounts. This layer of protection allows you to address threats without being a security expert, and without the need to manage third-party security monitoring systems.  

When anomalous activities occur, Azure Defender shows alerts and optionally sends them via email to subscription administrators. These alerts include the details of the suspicious activity and recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.
