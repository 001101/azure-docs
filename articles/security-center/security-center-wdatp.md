# Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection with Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center is extending its Cloud Workload Protection Platforms offering by integrating with [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://www.microsoft.com/WindowsForBusiness/windows-atp) (ATP).
This change brings comprehensive Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities. With Windows Defender ATP integration, you can spot abnormalities as well as detect and respond to advanced attacks on server endpoints monitored by Azure Security Center.

Azure Security Center customers can now use Windows Defender ATP's features:

- **Next-gen post breach detection sensors**: Windows Defender ATP sensor for Windows Servers collects a vast array of behavioral signals to enable advanced attack detection and investigation.

- **Analytics-based, cloud-powered post breach detection**: Windows Defender ATP quickly adapts to changing threats. Employing advanced analytics and big data, Windows Defender ATP is amplified by the power of the Intelligent Security Graph with signals across Windows, Azure, and Office to detect unknown threats. It provides actionable alerts and enables you to respond quickly.

- **Threat intelligence**: Windows Defender ATP identifies attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, then generates alerts when these are observed. It uses data generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners.

These capabilities are now available in Azure Security Center:

- **Automated onboarding**: Windows Defender ATP sensor is automatically enabled on Windows Servers that are onboarded to Azure Security Center.

- **Single pane of glass**: Azure Security Center console displays Windows Defender ATP alerts.

- **Detailed machine investigation**: Azure Security Center customers can access Windows Defender ATP console to perform a detailed investigation to uncover the scope of a breach.

You can [investigate the alert](security-center-investigation.md) in Azure Security Center:

![Figure 2 Investigation - Azure Security Center](media/security-center-wdatp/image2.png)

You can further investigate the alert by pivoting to Windows Defender ATP. There you can see additional information such as the alert process tree, the incident graph, and a detailed machine timeline showing all of the behaviors for a historical period of up to six months.

## Platform support

This feature supports detection on Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016.

Only servers in standard service tier subscriptions are supported.

## Onboarding instructions

To view if Windows Defender ATP integration is enabled, you can select **Security center** > **Security policy** > **Subscription** > **Edit settings**.

  ![Viewing the policy](media/security-center-wdatp/policy-management.png)

Here you can see the integrations currently enabled.

  ![Enabled integrations](media/security-center-wdatp/enable-integrations.png)

- If you already onboarded the servers to Security Center standard tier, no action required. Azure Security Center will automatically onboard the servers to Windows Defender ATP. This may take up to 24 hours.

- If you never onboarded the servers to Security Center standard tier, onboard to Azure Security Center as usual.

- If you onboarded the servers through Windows Defender ATP:
  - Refer to the documentation for guidance on [how to offboard server machines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=852906).
  - Onboard to Azure Security Center.

## Access to the Windows Defender ATP portal

Follow the instructions in [Assign user access to the portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/assign-portal-access-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection).

## Set firewall configuration

If you have a proxy or firewall that is blocking anonymous traffic, as Windows Defender ATP sensor is connecting from system context, make sure anonymous traffic is permitted. Follow the instructions on  [Enable access to Windows Defender ATP service URLs in the proxy server](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/configure-proxy-internet-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection#enable-access-to-windows-defender-atp-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server).

## Test the feature

To generate a benign Windows Defender ATP test alert:

1. Use Remote Desktop to sign in one of the Windows Server VMs (2012R2 or 2016) in the subscription and open a command prompt window.

2. At the prompt, copy and run the command below. The command prompt window will close automatically.

    ```command prompt
    powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe',
   'C:\\test-WDATP-test\\invoice.exe'); Start-Process
    'C:\\test-WDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
     ```

   ![image of the command above in a command prompt window](media/security-center-wdatp/image4.jpeg)

3. If successful, a new alert will appear in a few minutes in Security Center and Windows Defender ATP portal.

4. To review the alert in Security Center, go to **Security Alerts** >  **Suspicious Powershell CommandLine**.

5. From the investigation window, select the link to go to Windows Defender ATP portal.
