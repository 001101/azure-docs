# Deploying a partner vulnerability scanning solution





## Review the recommendation
After the vulnerability assessment solution is installed on the target VM, Security Center scans the VM to detect and identify vulnerabilities in the system and application.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take a couple of hours for the first scan to complete. After that, it is an hourly process.

Detected issues are shown under the **Virtual Machines Recommendations**.
