# Cross-tenant management in Security Center

You can view and manage the security posture of multiple tenants in Security Center by leveraging [Azure delegated resource management](../lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md)
. You can manage multiple tenants efficiently, from a single view, without having to sign in to different accounts.

- Service providers can manage Azure resources efficiently for multiple customers from within their own tenant.

- Managed service providers (MSP) can seamlessly manage an enterprise with multiple tenants from one location.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure delegated resource management is one of the key components of Azure Lighthouse. For details, see [Azure delegated resource management](../lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md).

## How does cross-tenant management work in Security Center

You are able to review and manage subscriptions across multiple tenants in the same way that you manage multiple subscriptions in a single tenant.

From each screen, click on the filter icon to select the tenants to view.

The views and actions are basically the same. Here are some examples:

- Cross-tenant visibility enables you to view the overall health of all your tenants and where and how to best improve the [secure score](security-center-secure-score.md) and [compliance posture](security-center-compliance-dashboard.md) for each of them. The following image shows one secure score measuring the overall security health of all the selected subscriptions from different tenants. It prioritizes your security recommendations, so you know which recommendations to perform first. This helps you find the most serious security vulnerabilities so you can prioritize remediating them.

Secure score is a tool that helps you assess your workload security posture.depicting the recommendations and prioritizes them for you, so you know which recommendations to perform first. This helps you find the most serious security vulnerabilities so you can prioritize investigation for all of your tenants.

- Monitor and remediate a [recommendation](security-center-recommendations.md) for many resources from various tenants at one time.

  ![Cross-tenant ](./media/security-center-cross-tenant-management/cross-tenant-recommendation.png)

- From one view, manage security posture of many resources with [policies](tutorial-security-policy.md), take actions with security recommendations, and collect and manage security related data.

- Detect [alerts](security-center-alerts-overview.md) throughout the different tenants.

- Take action on resources, at one time, that are out of compliance with actionable [remediation steps](security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md).

- Manage the various threat detection and protection services, such as [just-in-time (JIT)] VM access(security-center-just-in-time.md), [Adaptive Network Hardening](security-center-adaptive-network-hardening.md), [File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)](security-center-file-integrity-monitoring.md), and more.
