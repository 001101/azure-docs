# Security Center's enhanced Secure Score (Preview) 

This article introduces the enhanced Secure Score (currently in preview), the accompanying Security Controls, and the advantages they bring.

## An introduction to Secure Score

Azure Security Center has two main goals:

* To help you understand your current security situation
* To help you efficiently and effectively improve your security

The central aspect of Security Center that enables you to achieve those goals is **Secure Score**.

Security Center continually assesses your resources, subscriptions, and organization for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.

You can also use this score to track your security posture over time, and track security efforts and projects in your organization. The enhanced Secure Score (currently in preview) adds a percentage to the display to make it even simpler to track over time:

[![The enhanced Secure Score (preview) now includes a percentage](media/secure-score-and-controls/secure-score-with-percentage.png)](media/secure-score-and-controls/secure-score-with-percentage.png#lightbox)


## Where is your Secure Score? 

Security Center displays your score prominently: it's the first thing shown in the Overview page. If you click through to the dedicated Secure Score page, you'll see the score broken down by subscription. If you then click a single subscription, you'll see the detailed list of prioritized recommendations and the potential impact that remediating them will have on the subscription’s score. 

## How is the Secure Score calculated? 

Before this preview, Security Center considered each recommendation individually and assigned a value to it based on its severity. Security teams working to improve their security posture had to prioritize responses to Security Center recommendations based on the full list of findings. Every time you remediated a recommendation for a single resource, your Secure Score improved.

As part of the enhancements to the Secure Score, recommendations are now grouped into **controls**. These are a logical grouping of related recommendations. Points are no longer awarded at the recommendation level; instead your score will only improve when you remediate *all* of the recommendations for a single resource within a control. 

The contribution of each Security Control towards the overall Secure Score is shown clearly on the recommendations page.

[![The enhanced Secure Score (preview) introduces Security Controls](media/secure-score-and-controls/security-controls.png)](media/secure-score-and-controls/security-controls.png#lightbox)

To get all the possible points for a Security Control, all your resources must comply with all of the security recommendations within the Security Control. For example, Security Center has multiple recommendations regarding how to secure your management ports. In the past, you could remediate some of those related and interdependent recommendations while leaving others unsolved, and your Secure Score would improve. When looked at objectively, it's easy to argue that your security hadn't improved until you had resolved them all. Now, you must remediate them all to make a difference to your Secure Score.  

For example, the Security Control Apply system updates has a maximum score of 6: 

![The enhanced Secure Score (preview) introduces Security Controls](media/secure-score-and-controls/apply-system-updates-control.png)

If you have three virtual machines, each one can potentially contribute a score of 0 or 2 (since it must meet all recommendations). 

## How to improve your Secure Score? 

To improve your Secure Score, remediate the security recommendations from your recommendations list. You can remediate each recommendation manually for each resource, or by using the **quick fix** label (when available) to quickly apply a remediation for a recommendation to a group of resources. For more information, see [Remediate recommendations](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md). 


## Security Controls and their recommendations

The table below lists the Security Controls in Azure Security Center. For each control, you can see the maximum number of points you can add to your Secure Score if you remediate *all* of the recommendations listed in the control, for *all* of your resources.

## Secure Score FAQ

### Why has my Secure Score gone down?
With the changes introduced in this enhanced Secure Score, you must solve all recommendation for a resource to receive points. The scores also changed to a scale of 0-10.

### If I address only 3 out of 4 recommendations on a Security Control, will my Secure Score change?
No; it won't change until you remediate all of the recommendation for a single resource. To get the maximum score for a control, you must remediate all recommendations, for all resources.

### Will this enhanced Secure Score replace the old Secure Score? 
Yes, but for a while they will be running side-by-side to ease the transition.

### If a recommendation is not applicable to me, and I disable it in the policy, will my Security Control be considered fulfilled and my Secure Score updated?
Yes. We recommend disabling recommendations when they're inapplicable in your environment. For instructions on how to disable a specific recommendation, see [Disable security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy#disable-security-policies).

### If a Security Control offers me zero points towards my Secure Score, should I ignore it?
In some cases you will see a control max score greater than zero, but the impact is zero. This is because the incremental score for fixing some resources is negligible, so it is rounded to zero. However, don't ignore these recommendations as they still bring security improvements. The only exception is the “Additional Best Practice” control. Remediating these recommendations won't increase your score, but it will enhance your overall security.
