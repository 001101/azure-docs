# Built-in vulnerability scanner (preview) for your virtual machines

A core component of any cyber risk or security program is the identification and analysis of vulnerabilities. If you're using the Standard Tier of Azure Security Center, the industry-leading Qualys vulnerability scanner is available to at no extra cost. Additionally, Security Center can automatically deploy and integrate this tool for you.

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer to use your own third-party vulnerability scanner, Security Center supports the integration of tools from other vendors. But this will require separate licensing costs and performing your own deployment and configuration. 

## Deploying the vulnerability scanner (powered by Qualys) <a name="deploy-vm-va"></a>

The fastest way to scan your Azure-based virtual machines for vulnerabilities is to use the built-in vulnerability scanner from Qualys. 

To deploy the Qualys vulnerability scanner:

1. Open Azure Security Center and go to the **Recommendations** page. 

1. Enter "Qualys" into the filter box to see all Qualys-related recommendations, then select "Enable the built-in vulnerability assessment solution on virtual machines (powered by Qualys)".

    [![Recommendations page in Azure Security Center filtered to Qualys recommendations](media/built-in-vulnerability-assessment/va-recommendations-enable-selected.png)](media/built-in-vulnerability-assessment/va-recommendations-enable-selected.png#lightbox)

    > [!TIP]
    > For a list of your VMs that already have the Qualys vulnerability scanner deployed, select the "Healthy Resources" tab. 

1. From the Unhealthy resources tab, select the VMs on which you want to deploy the Qualys scanner and click **Remediate**.

    The scanner extension will be installed on all selected VMs and scanning begins automatically as soon as the agent is successfully deployed.


## Viewing the findings of the vulnerability scans

When the extension identifies vulnerabilities, the findings and remediation steps provided by Qualys are pushed to Security Center. You can view the identified vulnerabilities for one or more subscriptions, or for a specific virtual machine.

To see the findings and remediate the issues identified by the Qualys vulnerability scanner:

1. Open Azure Security Center and go to the **Recommendations** page. 

1. Enter "Qualys" into the filter box to see all Qualys-related recommendations, then select "Remediate vulnerabilities found on your virtual machines (powered by Qualys)"

    Security Center shows you all the findings for all VMs in the currently selected subscriptions. The findings are ordered by severity. 

    [![List of findings from Qualys for all selected subscriptions](media/built-in-vulnerability-assessment/va-findings-all.png)](media/built-in-vulnerability-assessment/va-findings-all.png#lightbox)

1. To filter the findings by a specific VM, open the "Affected resources" section and click the VM that interests you.

    Security Center shows the findings for that VM, ordered by severity. 

    [![Findings for a specific virtual machine](media/built-in-vulnerability-assessment/va-findings.png)](media/built-in-vulnerability-assessment/va-findings.png#lightbox)

    In this example, you can see that 94 vulnerabilities were discovered and that 5 of them are medium severity.

1. To learn more about a specific vulnerability, select it. 

    A details pane appears.

    The pane contains details supplied by Qualys that include:
    
    * Links to all relevant CVEs (where available)
    * Remediation steps
    * Any additional reference pages



## Built-in Qualys vulnerability scanner FAQ

### Are there any additional charges for the Qualys license?
No. The built-in scanner is free to all Standard tier users. No additional licenses are required and the scanner deployed by the "Enable the built-in vulnerability assessment solution on virtual machines (powered by Qualys)" recommendation includes all the necessary licensing and configuration information.  

### If I have an existing Qualys solution, should I just add this as well?
We recommend removing your existing Qualys scanner and adding the Security Center extension as described above. If you have already configured some of your VMs to use a pre-existing Qualys license, you can choose to leave your existing solution in place while simultaneously deploying the new Security Center extension to other VMs. 

If you're a Standard tier customer, and you already have a vulnerability assessment tool deployed (whether Qualys, Rapid7, or others) you will still see your existing solution and the findings will still show in Security Center. If you want to install a scanner on virtual machines that don't have any existing vulnerability assessment tool deployed, you must deploy this new one. 

Findings will be split between the old and new recommendation screens.

### Why don't I see the "Enable the built-in vulnerability assessment solution" recommendation?
If you are on the free tier of Security Center, you will not see the new Qualys recommendation; it's only available on the Standard tier. 

### What permissions are required to install the Qualys extension?
The Qualys extension, like other extensions, runs on top of the Azure Virtual Machine agent. So it runs as Local Host on Windows, and Root on Linux.

### Can I remove the Security Center Qualys extension? 
If you want to remove the extensions from a VM, you can do it manually or with any of your programmatic tools. 

You'll need the following details:

* On Linux, the extension is called "LinuxAgent.AzureSecurityCenter" and provider name is "Qualys"
* On Windows, the extension is called "WindowsAgent.AzureSecurityCenter" and provider name is "Qualys"

### How does the extension get updated?
Like the Azure Security Center agent as well as all Azure extensions, the Qualys scanner is automatically updated in the background. All agents are tested extensively before being deployed.

### What is scanned by the built-in vulnerability scanner?
The scanner is running on your virtual machine and looking for vulnerabilities of the VM itself. No network scanning is performed. 

### Does the scanner integrate with my existing Qualys console?
This is a separate tool from your existing Qualys scanner and, due to licensing restrictions, can only be used within Azure Security Center.

### Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection also includes Threat & Vulnerability Management (TVM). How is this different?
The TVM included in Microsoft Defender doesn't have the same capabilities as the scanner from Qualys, the industry's most advanced, scalable, and extensible solution for vulnerability management. Two examples of where the tools differ: 

* Qualys's scanner supports Windows and Linux VMs
* Qualys's scanner finds vulnerabilities that don't have CVEs and are based on Qualys's own knowledge
