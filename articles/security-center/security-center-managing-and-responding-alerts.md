# Managing and responding to security alerts in Azure Security Center

This topic shows you how to view and process the alerts that you have received in order to protect your resources. 

* To learn about the different types of alerts, see [Security alert types](security-alerts-overview#security-alert-types).
* For an overview of how Security Center generates alerts, see [How Azure Security Center detects and responds to threats](security-alerts-overview#detect-threats).

> [!NOTE]
> To enable advanced detections, upgrade to Azure Security Center Standard. A free trial is available. To upgrade, select Pricing Tier in the [Security Policy](tutorial-security-policy.md). See [Azure Security Center pricing](security-center-pricing.md) to learn more.


## What are security alerts?
Security Center automatically collects, analyzes, and integrates log data from your Azure resources, the network, and connected partner solutions, like firewall and endpoint protection solutions, to detect real threats and reduce false positives. A list of prioritized security alerts is shown in Security Center along with the information you need to quickly investigate the problem and recommendations for how to remediate an attack.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about how Security Center detection capabilities work, read [Azure Security Center Detection Capabilities](security-center-detection-capabilities.md).

## Manage your security alerts

You can review your current alerts by looking at the **Security alerts** tile. Follow the steps below to see more details about each alert:

1. On the Security Center dashboard, the **Security alerts** tile displays an overview of the alerts.

1. To see more details about the alerts, click the tile.

   ![The Security alerts in Security Center](./media/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts/security-center-manage-alerts.png)

    The alerts and their details are listed at the bottom of the page. To sort, click the column that you want to sort by. For more about the alert columns and alert severities, see [Alert severities](security-center-alerts-overview.md#alert-severities) and [Understand alert details](security-center-alerts-overview.md#alert-details).

1. To filter the alerts shown, click **Filter**, and from the **Filter** blade that opens, select the filter options that you want to apply. The list updates according to the selected filter. Filtering can be very helpful. For example, you might you want to address security alerts that occurred in the last 24 hours because you are investigating a potential breach in the system.

## Respond to security alerts

1. Click a security alert. The resources involved and the steps you need to take to remediate an attack is shown.

    ![Respond to security alerts](./media/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts/security-center-alert.png)

1. After reviewing the information, click a resource that was attacked.

    ![Suggestions for what to do about security alerts](./media/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts/security-center-alert-remediate.png)

    In the **Description** field, see additional details which can offer an insight into what triggered the security alert. You can see the target resource, when applicable the source IP address, and recommendations about how to remediate.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >In some instances, the source IP address is empty (not available) because not all Windows security events logs include the IP address.

1. The remediation suggested by Security Center vary according to the security alert. Follow the remediation steps given for each alert. 
In some cases, in order to mitigate a threat detection alert, you may have to use other Azure controls or services to implement the recommended remediation. 

    The following topics guide you through the different alerts, according to resource types:
    
    * [IaaS VMs and servers alerts](security-center-alerts-iaas.md)
    * [Native compute alerts](security-center-alerts-compute.md)
    * [Data services alerts](security-center-alerts-data-services.md)
    
    The following topics explain how Security Center uses the different telemetry that it collects from integrating with the Azure infrastructure, in order to apply additional protection layers for resources deployed on Azure:
    
    * [Service layer alerts](security-center-alerts-service-layer.md)
    * [Integration with Azure security products](security-center-alerts-integration.md)
