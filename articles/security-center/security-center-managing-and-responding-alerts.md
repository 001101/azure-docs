# Managing and responding to security alerts in Azure Security Center
This topic helps you use Azure Security Center to manage and respond to security alerts.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable advanced detections, upgrade to Azure Security Center Standard. A free trial is available. To upgrade, select Pricing Tier in the [Security Policy](tutorial-security-policy.md). See [Azure Security Center pricing](security-center-pricing.md) to learn more.

## What are security alerts?
Security Center automatically collects, analyzes, and integrates log data from your Azure resources, the network, and connected partner solutions, like firewall and endpoint protection solutions, to detect real threats and reduce false positives. A list of prioritized security alerts is shown in Security Center along with the information you need to quickly investigate the problem and recommendations for how to remediate an attack.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about how Security Center detection capabilities work, read [Azure Security Center Detection Capabilities](security-center-detection-capabilities.md).

## Managing security alerts

You can review your current alerts by looking at the **Security alerts** tile. Follow the steps below to see more details about each alert:

1. On the Security Center dashboard, the **Security alerts** tile displays an overview of the alerts.

  ![Security alerts tile in Security Center](./media/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts/security-center-dashboard-alert.png)

1. To see more details about the alerts, click the tile.

   ![The Security alerts in Security Center](./media/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts/security-center-manage-alerts.png)

In the bottom part of this page are the details for each alert. To sort, click the column that you want to sort by. The definition for each column is given below:

* **Description**: A brief explanation of the alert.
* **Count**: A list of all alerts of this specific type that were detected on a specific day.
* **Detected by**: The service that was responsible for triggering the alert.
* **Environment**: The environment where the alert occurred.
* **Date**: The date that the event occurred.
* **State**: The current state for that alert. There are two types of states:
  * **Active**: The security alert has been detected.
  * **Dismissed**: The security alert has been dismissed by the user. This status is typically used for alerts that were investigated and either mitigated or found not to be an actual attack.
* **Severity**: The severity level, which can be high, medium, or low.

> [!NOTE]
> Security alerts generated by Security Center will also appear under Azure Activity Log. For more information about how to access Azure Activity Log, read [View activity logs to audit actions on resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-audit).

### Alert severity

-	**High**: There is a high probability that your resource is compromised. 
You should look into it right away. Security Center has high confidence in both the malicious intent and in the findings used to issue the alert. For example, an alert that detects the execution of a known malicious tool such as Mimikatz, a common tool used for credential theft. 
-	**Medium**: This is probably a suspicious activity that may indicate that a resource is compromised.
Security Center’s confidence in the analytic or finding is medium and the confidence of the malicious intent is medium to high. These would usually be machine learning or anomaly-based detections. For example, a sign-in attempt from an anomalous location.
-	**Low**: This might be a benign positive or a blocked attack. 
    - Security Center is not confident enough that the intent is malicious and the activity may be innocent. For example, log clear is an action that may happen when an attacker tries to hide their tracks, but in many cases is a routine operation performed by admins.
    - Security Center doesn’t usually tell you when attacks were blocked, unless it’s an interesting case that we suggest you look into. 
-	**Informational**: You will only see informational alerts when you drill down into a security incident, or if you use the REST API with a specific alert ID. An incident is typically made up of a number of alerts, some of which may appear on their own to be only informational, but in the context of the other alerts may be worthy of a closer look.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the **2015-06-01-preview** API version, then there are differences in which alarm severity types are applied to which scenarios, from what is listed above.  

### Filtering alerts
You can filter the security alerts listed. Filtering alerts can be useful for scenarios where you need to narrow the scope of security alerts show. For example, you might you want to address security alerts that occurred in the last 24 hours because you are investigating a potential breach in the system.

1. Click **Filter** on the **Security Alerts**. The **Filter** blade opens.
1. Select the filter options that you want to apply. The list updates according to the selected filter.

### Respond to security alerts
Click a security alert to learn more about the event(s) that triggered the alert and what, if any, steps you need to take to remediate an attack. 

![Respond to security alerts in Azure Security Center](./media/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts/security-center-alert.png)

After reviewing th information, click the resource that was attacked.

![Suggestions for what to do about security alerts in Azure Security Center](./media/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts/security-center-alert-remediate.png)

In the **Description** field, you find more details about this event. These additional details offer insight into what triggered the security alert, the target resource, when applicable the source IP address, and recommendations about how to remediate.  In some instances, the source IP address is empty (not available) because not all Windows security events logs include the IP address.

The remediation suggested by Security Center vary according to the security alert. In some cases, you may have to use other Azure capabilities to implement the recommended remediation. For example, the remediation for this attack is to not allow the IP address that is generating this attack by using a [network ACL](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-acl.md) or a [network security group](../virtual-network/security-overview.md#security-rules) rule. For more information on the different types of alerts, read [Security alerts types](security-center-alerts-overview.md#security-alert-types).

> Security Center has released to limited preview a new set of detections that leverage auditd records, a common auditing framework, to detect malicious behaviors on Linux machines. Please send an email
