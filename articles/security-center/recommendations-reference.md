# Security recommendations - a reference guide

This article provides the full list of the recommendations you might see in Azure Security Center.

For an explanation of how to find these and how to resolve them, see [here](security-center-network-recommendations.md).

Your secure score is based on how many Security Center recommendations you have mitigated. To prioritize the recommendations to resolve first, consider the severity of each, as well as the Security Controls described in [Secure Score and Security Controls]().  

## Recommendations

|Recommendation|Description & related policy|Severity|Quick fix enabled|Resource type|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
||***Network recommendations***|
|**Network security groups on the subnet level should be enabled**|Enable network security groups to control network access of resources deployed in your subnets.<br>(Related policy: Subnets should be associated with a Network Security Group)|High/ Medium|N|Subnet|
|**Virtual machines should be associated with a network security group**|Enable Network Security Groups to control network access of your virtual machines.<br>(Related policy: Virtual machines should be associated with a Network Security Group)|High/ Medium|N|Virtual machine|
|**Access should be restricted for permissive network security groups with Internet-facing VMs**|Harden the network security groups of your Internet-facing VMs by restricting the access of your existing allow rules.<br>(Related policy: Network Security Group Rules for Internet facing virtual machines should be hardened)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**The rules for web applications on IaaS NSGs should be hardened**|Harden the network security group (NSG) of your virtual machines that are running web applications, with NSG rules that are overly permissive with regards to web application ports.<br>(Related policy: The NSGs rules for web applications on IaaS should be hardened)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**Access to App Services should be restricted**|Restrict access to your App Services by changing the networking configuration, to deny inbound traffic from ranges that are too broad.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Access to App Services should be restricted)|High|N|App service|
|**Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines**|Harden the network security group of your virtual machines to restrict access to management ports.<br>(Related policy: Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled**|Protect virtual networks containing applications with public IPs by enabling DDoS protection service standard. DDoS protection enables mitigation of network volumetric and protocol attacks.<br>(Related policy: DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled)|High|N|Virtual network|
|**IP forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled**|Disable IP forwarding. When IP forwarding is enabled on a virtual machine's NIC, the machine can receive traffic addressed to other destinations. IP forwarding is rarely required (for example, when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: IP Forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled)|Medium|N|Virtual machine|
|**Web Application should only be accessible over HTTPS**|Enable "HTTPS only" access for web applications. Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.<br>(Related policy: &#x1F535;)|Medium|**Y**|Web application|
|**Just-in-time network access control should be applied on virtual machines**|Apply just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access control to permanently lock down access to selected ports, and enable authorized users to open them, via JIT, for a limited amount of time only.<br>(Related policy: Just-In-Time network access control should be applied on virtual machines )|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**Function Apps should only be accessible over HTTPS**|Enable "HTTPS only" access for function apps. Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.<br>(Related policy: &#x1F535;)|Medium|**Y**|Function app|
|**Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled**|Enable secure transfer to storage accounts. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.<br>(Related policy: Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled)|High|**Y**|Storage account|
