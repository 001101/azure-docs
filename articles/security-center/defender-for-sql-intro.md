# Introduction to Azure Defender for SQL

Azure Defender for SQL detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases.

You'll see alerts when there are suspicious database activities, potential vulnerabilities, or SQL injection attacks, and anomalous database access and query patterns.

> [!TIP]
> To enable Security Center's threat protection capabilities, you must enable Azure Defender on the subscription containing the applicable workloads.
>
> You can enable **Azure Defender for SQL** at either the subscription level or resource level.
