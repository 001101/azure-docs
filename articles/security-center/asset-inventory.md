# Explore and manage your resources with asset inventory and management tools

The asset inventory page of Azure Security Center provides a single page for full visibility of the resources you've connected to Security Center. You can use this view and its filters to address such questions as:

- Which of my subscriptions are on Security Center's standard tier?
- Which of my machines with the tag 'Production' are missing the Log Analytics agent?
- How many of my machines are tagged with a specific tag?
- How many resources in a specific resource group have active security alertsâ€‹ or findings from a vulnerability assessment service?

The asset management possibilities for this tool are substantial and continue to grow.

## How does asset inventory work?

Asset inventory utilizes [Azure Resource Graph (ARG)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/), the Azure service that stores all of ASC's security posture data.

ARG is designed to provide efficient resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across multiple subscriptions. 

Using the [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/), asset inventory can quickly produce deep insights by cross-referencing ASC data with other resource properties.


## What are the key features of asset inventory?

The inventory page provides the following tools:

- **Metrics** - Before you define any filters, a prominent strip of values at the top of the inventory view shows:

    - **Total resources**: The total number of resources connected to Security Center
    - **Unhealthy resources**: Resources with active security recommendations
    - **Unmonitored resources**: Resources with agent monitoring issues - they have the Log Analytics agent deployed, but the agent isn't sending data or has other health issues.

- **Filters** - The multiple filters at the top of the page provide a way to quickly refine the list of resources according to the question you're trying to answer. For example, if you wanted to answer the question *Which of my machines with the tag 'Production' are missing the Log Analytics agent?* you could combine the **Agent monitoring** filter with the **Tags** filter as shown in the following clip:

    ![Filtering to production resources that aren't monitored](./media/asset-inventory/filtering-to-prod-unmonitored.gif)

    As soon as you've applied filters, the metrics are updated to relate to the query results. 

- **Export options** - Inventory provides the option to export the results of your selected filter options to a CSV file. In addition, you can export the query itself to Azure Resource Graph Explorer to further refine, save, or modify the KQL query.

    > [!TIP]
    > The KQL documentation provides a database with some sample data together with some simple queries to get the "feel" for the language. [Learn more in this KQL tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer).

- **Asset management options** - Inventory lets you perform complex discovery queries. When you've found the resources that match your queries, inventory provides shortcuts for operations such as:

    - Upgrade a subscription from free to standard tier - open the context menu (right click) on a subscription to upgrade 
    - Assign tags to the filtered resources - select the checkboxes alongside the resources you want to tag
    - Onboard new servers to Security Center - use the **Add non-Azure servers** toolbar button

- **Page refresh** - If you've defined some filters and left the page open, Security Center won't update the results automatically. Any changes to resources won't impact the displayed results unless manually reload the page or select **Refresh**.


## How to use asset inventory

1. From Security Center's sidebar, select **Inventory**.

1. Optionally, to display a specific resource enter the name in the **Filter by name** box.

1. Define the filters to create the specific query you want to perform.

    By default, the resources are sorted by the number of active security recommendations.

1. To use the **Security findings contain** filter, enter free text from the ID, security check, or CVE name of a vulnerability finding to filter to the affected resources:

    !["Security findings contain" filter](./media/asset-inventory/security-findings-contain-elements.png)

1. To further examine the results of your query, select the resources that interest you.

1. Optionally, select **View in resource graph explorer** to open the query in Resource Graph Explorer.
