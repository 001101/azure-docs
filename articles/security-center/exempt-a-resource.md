# Exempt a resource from recommendations and secure score


We are also very excited to announce the public preview of a more fine-grained ability to manage and control security recommendations and their application on one’s resources. This includes ability to exempt specific resources from specific security recommendations, with documented reasoning and easy monitoring of exemptions. Another advanced capability is to customize security findings either by configuring which findings should be applicable, such as by severity, type, name or any other category. This allows maximum flexibility of adjusting the security recommendations to the organization’s policy and priorities and by that better representation of their security posture in Secure Score.
