# Vulnerability assessment in Azure Security Center

A core component of every cyber risk and security program is the identification and analysis of vulnerabilities. Azure Security Center includes vulnerability scanning with the Standard pricing tier at no extra cost. Additionally, Security Center can automatically deploy and integrate this tool for you. This feature is currently in preview.

The vulnerability assessment components of Security Center are managed through recommendations on your virtual machines. If Security Center doesn't find a vulnerability assessment solution installed on a VM:

* **For Standard tier users**, a recommendation offers to install an Azure Security Center Vulnerability Assessment extension (powered by Qualys) for you at no additional cost. This extension reports its findings directly back to Security Center. To learn more, see [Integrated vulnerability scanner for virtual machines](built-in-vulnerability-assessment.md).

* **For users on the Free tier**, Security Center recommends that you install a partner solution. You will need to purchase licenses for your chosen solution separately. Supported solutions report vulnerability data to the partnerâ€™s management platform. In turn, that platform provides vulnerability and health monitoring data back to Security Center. You can identify vulnerable VMs on the Security Center dashboard. Switch to the partner management console directly from Security Center for additional reports and information. To learn more, see [Deploying a partner vulnerability scanning solution](partner-vulnerability-assessment.md).
