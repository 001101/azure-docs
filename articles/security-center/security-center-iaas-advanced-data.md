# Advanced data security for SQL servers (Preview)
Advanced data security for SQL Servers is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. This preview feature includes functionality for identifying and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate threats to your database. 

This offering is an extension of the [advanced data security package](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-advanced-data-security), already available for Azure SQL Databases, Synapse and SQL Managed Instance, all powered by Azure Security Center.  


## Overview

Advanced data security provides a set of advanced SQL security capabilities, consisting of Vulnerability assessment and Advanced Threat Protection.

* [Vulnerability assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment) is an easy to configure service that can discover, track, and help you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. Assessment scans provide an overview of your SQL servers' security state, and details of any security findings. 

* [Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection-overview) detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your SQL server. It continuously monitors your database for suspicious activities and provides action-oriented security alerts on anomalous database access patterns. These alerts provide the suspicious activity details and recommended actions to investigate and mitigate the threat.



## Connecting your SQL Server's host to your Azure account

Advanced data security for SQL servers by Azure Security Center requires the SQL server host to be connected to Azure through the Log Analytics agent.  

The procedure to set that up depends on the type of host machine. Select the relevant tab below.

### [SQL Server on Azure VMs](#tab/sql-on-azurevm)
If your SQL Server is hosted on an Azure VM, the procedure is the same one you'd use to [add any Azure VM](quick-onboard-azure-stack.md#add-the-virtual-machine-extension-to-your-existing-azure-stack-virtual-machines) and it can even be auto-provisioned.

### [SQL Server on Azure Arc](#tab/sql-on-azurearc)
If your SQL Server is hosted on an [Azure Arc](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/) machine, connect it with the Log Analytics agent as described in the [Azure Arc documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-portal#install-and-validate-the-agent-on-windows).

### [SQL Server on-prem](#tab/sql-on-prem)
If your SQL Server is hosted on an on-premises Windows machine, you have two options for connecting it to Azure. 

* **Set up Azure Arc** - Any Windows machine can be connected to Azure Security Center. However, for alerts from advanced data security to appear in the security tab in the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** page, set up Azure Arc on the host and then follow the instructions for an Azure Arc hosted SQL Server.

    In addition to the alerts appearing in the security tab, Azure Arc provides deeper integration across *all* of your Azure environment. 

* **Connect the Windows machine without Azure Arc** - If you choose to connect a SQL Server running on a Windows machine without using Azure Arc, follow the instructions inâ€¯[Connect Windows machines to Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows).

### Enable advanced data security for SQL

Enable Advanced Data Security for SQL Servers on Virtual Machines at the subscription/workspace level:
 
1. From Security Center's sidebar, open the **Pricing & settings** page.

1. Select the subscription or workspace for which you want to enable Advanced Data Security for SQL on Azure VMs.

1. Toggle the option for **SQL servers (Preview)** to enabled. 

    [![Security Center recommendations and alerts as seen in Windows Admin Center](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/sql-servers-on-vms-in-pricing-small.png)](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/sql-servers-on-vms-in-pricing-large.png#lightbox)

    Advanced Data Security for SQL Servers will be enabled on all SQL Servers connected to the selected workspace or the default workspace of the selected subscription.

    >[!NOTE]
    > The solution will be fully active after the first restart of the SQL Server. 

To create a new workspace, follow the instructions in [Create a Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace).




## Set up email notification for security alerts 

You can set a list of recipients to receive an email notification when Security Center alerts are generated. The email contains a direct link to the alert in Azure Security Center with all the relevant details. 

For more information, see [Set up email notifications for security alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details).



## Explore vulnerability assessment reports

The Vulnerability assessment dashboard provides an overview of your assessment results across all your databases. You can view the distribution of databases according to SQL Server version, along with a summary of failing versus passing databases and an overall summary of failing checks according to risk distribution.

You can view the vulnerability assessment results directly from Security Center.

1. From Security Center's sidebar, under RESOURCE SECURITY HYGIENE, select **Data & Storage**.

1. Select the recommendation **Vulnerabilities on your SQL databases in VMs should be remediated (Preview)**. For more information, see [Security Center Recommendations](security-center-recommendations.md). 

    [![**Vulnerabilities on your SQL databases in VMs should be remediated (Preview)** recommendation](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/data-and-storage-sqldb-vulns-on-vm.png)](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/data-and-storage-sqldb-vulns-on-vm.png#lightbox)

    The detailed view for this recommendation appears.

    [![Detailed view for the **Vulnerabilities on your SQL databases in VMs should be remediated (Preview)** recommendation](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/all-servers-view.png)](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/all-servers-view.png#lightbox)

1. To drill down for more details:

    * For an overview of scanned resources (databases) and the list of security checks that were tested, click the server of interest.
    [![Vulnerabilities grouped by SQL server](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/single-server-view.png)](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/single-server-view.png#lightbox)

    * For an overview of the vulnerabilities grouped by a specific SQL database, click the database of interest.
    [![Vulnerabilities grouped by SQL server](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/single-database-view.png)](media/security-center-advanced-iaas-data/single-database-view.png#lightbox)

    In each view, the security checks are sorted by **Severity**. Click a specific security check to see a details pane with a **Description**, how to **Remediate** it, and other related information such as **Impact** or **Benchmark**.

## Advanced threat protection for SQL servers on Azure VMs alerts
Alerts are generated by unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit SQL Servers. These events can trigger alerts shown in the [Alerts for SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse section of the alerts reference page](alerts-reference.md#alerts-sql-db-and-warehouse).



## Explore and investigate security alerts

Your data security alerts are available in Security Center's alerts page, the resource's security tab, or through the direct link in the alert emails.

1. To view alerts:

    * In Security Center - Click **Security alerts** from the sidebar and select an alert.
    * In the resource scope - Open the relevant resource page, and from the sidebar click **Security**. 

1. Alerts are designed to be self-contained, with detailed remediation steps and investigation information in each one. You can investigate further by using other Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel capabilities for a broader view:

    * Enable SQL Server's auditing feature for further investigations. If you're an Azure Sentinel user, you can upload the SQL auditing logs from the Windows Security Log events to Sentinel and enjoy a rich investigation experience.
    * To improve your security posture, use Security Center's recommendations for the host machine indicated in each alert. This will reduce the risks of future attacks.
