Security Center offers customers with additional Microsoft licenses to onboard their findings to Security Center and view them in a consolidated manner.

* [Azure WAF](#azure-waf)
* [Azure DDoS](#azure-ddos)

## Azure WAF <a name="azure-waf"></a>

Azure Application Gateway offers a web application firewall (WAF) that provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities.

Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. The Application Gateway WAF is based on Core Rule Set (CRS) 3.0 or 2.2.9 from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). The WAF is updated automatically to protect against new vulnerabilities, with no additional configuration needed. Alerts generated by WAF are streamed to Security Center. For more information on the alerts generated by WAF, see [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules?tabs=owasp3#crs911).

## Azure DDoS <a name="azure-ddos"></a>

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are some of the largest availability and security concerns facing customers that are moving their applications to the cloud. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an applicationâ€™s resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can occur at any endpoint that is publicly reachable through the Internet. 

Azure DDoS protection, combined with application design best practices, provide a defense against DDoS attacks. Azure DDoS protection provides different service tiers. For more information, see [Azure DDoS Protection overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview).

DDoS Protection Standard can mitigate the following types of attacks:
