# Vulnerability assessments for your Azure Virtual Machines

A core component of every cyber risk and security program is the identification and analysis of vulnerabilities. Azure Security Center's standard pricing tier includes vulnerability scanning for your virtual machines at no extra cost. Additionally, Security Center can automatically deploy this tool for you.

## Security Center's recommendation to deploy vulnerability assessment

When Security Center discovers a connected VM without a vulnerability assessment solution deployed, it provides the security recommendation "**A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines**".

Use this recommendation to deploy the vulnerability assessment solution that best meets your needs and budget:

- **Standard tier users** - Only customers using Security Center's standard tier have the option to install an integrated vulnerability assessment extension (powered by Qualys) at no additional cost. This extension reports its findings directly back to Security Center. Learn more about the activities of this scanner in [How the integrated vulnerability scanner works](#how-the-integrated-vulnerability-scanner-works).

- **All customers** - If you have a private license (BYOL) for a vulnerability assessment solution from a supported third-party you can deploy your preferred tool. You'll retain responsibility for licensing costs and configuration. The advantages of deploying a BYOL tool through Security Center are:
    - Security Center can monitor for machines that are missing the tool.
    - You'll be able to view findings and manage all of your security issues within Security Center.

    Learn more about [how to deploy a BYOL solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md). 


## Overview of the integrated vulnerability scanner

The vulnerability scanner included with Azure Security Center is powered by Qualys. Qualys' scanner is the leading tool for real-time identification of vulnerabilities in your Azure Virtual Machines. It's only available to users on the standard pricing tier. You don't need a Qualys license or even a Qualys account - everything's handled seamlessly inside Security Center.

### Availability

- Release state: **Generally Available**
- Required roles: **Resource owner** can deploy the scanner. **Security reader** can view findings.
- Clouds: 

    ✔ Commercial clouds 

    ✘ National/Sovereign (US Gov, China Gov, Other Gov)

### How the integrated vulnerability scanner works

The vulnerability scanner extension works as follows:

1. **Deploy** - Azure Security Center deploys the Qualys extension to the selected virtual machine/s.

1. **Gather information** - The extension collects artifacts and sends them for analysis in the Qualys cloud service in the defined region.

1. **Analyze** - Qualys' cloud service conducts the vulnerability assessment and sends its findings to Security Center. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To ensure the privacy, confidentiality, and security of our customers, Microsoft doesn't share customer details with Qualys. [Learn more about the privacy standards built into Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy).

1. **Report** - The findings are available to you in Security Center.

## Deploy the integrated vulnerability scanner to standard tier VMs

1. From the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-portal/), open **Security Center**.

1. From Security Center's menu, open the **Recommendations** page.

1. Select the recommendation **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm/recommendation-page-machine-groupings.png" alt-text="The groupings of the machines in the **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines** recommendation page" lightbox="./media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm/recommendation-page-machine-groupings.png":::

    Your VMs will appear in one or more of the following groups:

    * **Healthy resources** – Security Center has detected a vulnerability assessment solution running on these VMs.
    * **Unhealthy resources** – A vulnerability scanner extension can be deployed to these VMs. 
    * **Not applicable resources** – these VMs can't have a vulnerability scanner extension deployed. Your standard tier VM might be in this tab because it's an image in an AKS cluster, it's part of a virtual machine scale set, or it's not running one of the supported operating systems for the integrated vulnerability scanner:

        | **Vendor** | **OS** | **Supported versions** |
        |----|----|----|
        |Microsoft|Windows|All|
        |Red Hat|Enterprise Linux|5.4+, 6, 7.0-7.8, 8|
        |Red Hat|CentOS|5.4+, 6, 7.0-7.7|
        |Red Hat|Fedora|22-25|
        |SUSE|Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)|11, 12, 15|
        |SUSE|OpenSUSE|12, 13|
        |SUSE|Leap|42.1|
        |Oracle|Enterprise Linux|5.11, 6, 7.0-7.5|
        |Debian|Debian|7.x-9.x|
        |Ubuntu|Ubuntu|12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 15.x, 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS|

1. From the list of unhealthy machines, select the ones to receive a vulnerability assessment solution and select **Remediate**.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > Depending on your configuration, you may only see a subset of this list. 
    >
    > - If you haven't got a third-party vulnerability scanner configured, you won't be offered the opportunity to deploy it.
    > - If your selected VMs aren't on the standard tier, you won't be offered the ASC integrated vulnerability scanner.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm/recommendation-remediation-options.png" alt-text="The options for which type of remediation flow you want to choose when responding to the recommendation **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines** recommendation page":::

1. Choose the recommended option, **Deploy ASC integrated vulnerability scanner** and **Proceed**.

1. You'll be asked for one further confirmation. Select **Remediate**.

    The scanner extension will be installed on all of the selected VMs within a few minutes.
    
    Scanning begins automatically as soon as the extension is successfully deployed. Scans will then run at four-hour intervals. This interval is hard-coded and not configurable.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > If the deployment fails on one or more VMs, ensure the target VMs can communicate with Qualys' cloud service on the following two IP addresses (via port 443 - the default for HTTPS):
    >
    >   - 64.39.104.113 - Qualys' US data center
    >   - 154.59.121.74 - Qualys' European data center
    >
    > If your VM is in a European Azure region, its artifacts will be processed in Qualys' European data center. Artifacts for virtual machines located anywhere else are sent to the US data center. 


## FAQ - Integrated vulnerability scanner (powered by Qualys)

### Are there any additional charges for the Qualys license?
No. The built-in scanner is free to all standard tier users. The "Enable the built-in vulnerability assessment solution on virtual machines (powered by Qualys)" recommendation deploys the scanner with its licensing and configuration information. No additional licenses are required. 

### What prerequisites and permissions are required to install the Qualys extension?
You'll need write permissions for any VM on which you want to deploy the extension.

The Azure Security Center Vulnerability Assessment extension (powered by Qualys), like other extensions, runs on top of the Azure Virtual Machine agent. So it runs as Local Host on Windows, and Root on Linux.

During setup, Security Center checks to ensure that the VM can communicate with the following two Qualys's data centers (via port 443 - the default for HTTPS):

- 64.39.104.113 - Qualys' US data center
- 154.59.121.74 - Qualys' European data center

In addition, the extension doesn't currently accept any proxy configuration details.

### Can I remove the Security Center Qualys extension? 
If you want to remove the extensions from a VM, you can do it manually or with any of your programmatic tools. 

You'll need the following details:

* On Linux, the extension is called "LinuxAgent.AzureSecurityCenter" and the publisher name is "Qualys"
* On Windows, the extension is called "WindowsAgent.AzureSecurityCenter" and the provider name is "Qualys"

### How does the extension get updated?
Like the Azure Security Center agent itself and all other Azure extensions, minor updates of the Qualys scanner may automatically happen in the background. All agents and extensions are tested extensively before being automatically deployed.

### Why does my VM show as "not applicable" in the recommendation?
The recommendation details page for the **"Enable the built-in vulnerability assessment solution on virtual machines (powered by Qualys)"** recommendation groups your VMs in one or more of the following lists: **Healthy resources**, **Unhealthy resources**, and **Not applicable resources**.

If you have VMs in the Not applicable resources group, it means Security Center can't deploy the vulnerability scanner extension on those VMs. 

Your VM might be in this tab because:

- It's on the free pricing tier - As explained above, the vulnerability scanner included with Azure Security Center is  only available to users on the standard pricing tier.

- It's an image in an AKS cluster or part of a virtual machine scale set - This extension doesn't support VMs that are PaaS resources.

- It's not running one of the supported operating systems:

    | **Vendor** | **OS** | **Supported versions** |
    |----|----|----|
    |Microsoft|Windows|All|
    |Red Hat|Enterprise Linux|5.4+, 6, 7.0-7.8, 8|
    |Red Hat|CentOS|5.4+, 6, 7.0-7.7|
    |Red Hat|Fedora|22-25|
    |SUSE|Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)|11, 12, 15|
    |SUSE|OpenSUSE|12, 13|
    |SUSE|Leap|42.1|
    |Oracle|Enterprise Linux|5.11, 6, 7.0-7.5|
    |Debian|Debian|7.x-9.x|
    |Ubuntu|Ubuntu|12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 15.x, 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS|

### What is scanned by the built-in vulnerability scanner?
The scanner is running on your virtual machine and looking for vulnerabilities of the VM itself. From the virtual machine, it can't scan your network.

### Does the scanner integrate with my existing Qualys console?
The Security Center extension is a separate tool from your existing Qualys scanner. Licensing restrictions mean that it can only be used within Azure Security Center.

### Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection also includes Threat & Vulnerability Management (TVM). How is the Security Center Vulnerability Assessment extension different?
Microsoft is actively developing world-class vulnerability management with Microsoft Defender ATP's Threat & Vulnerability Management solution, built into Windows.

Today, Azure Security Center's Vulnerability Assessment extension is powered by Qualys. The Qualys extension ensures support for both Windows and Linux VMs. The extension also benefits from Qualys's own knowledge of vulnerabilities that don't yet have CVEs.

### How quickly will the scanner identify newly disclosed critical vulnerabilities?
Within 48 hrs of the disclosure of a critical vulnerability, Qualys incorporates the information into their processing and can identify affected VMs.
