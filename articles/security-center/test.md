Attacks against data at rest include attempts to gain physical access to the hardware on which the data is stored. Azures use symmetric encryption to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data at rest. A symmetric encryption key is used to encrypt data as it is written to storage. That encryption key is also used to decrypt that data as it is readied for use in memory. Keys must be stored in a secure location with identity-based access control and audit policies. One such secure location is Azure Key Vault. If an attacker obtains the encrypted data but not the encryption keys, the attacker cannot access the data without breaking the encryption.</td>
