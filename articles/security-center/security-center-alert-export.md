# Exporting alert logs to Log Analytics
This article explains how to export the alerts that were generated by Azure Security Center to a Log Analytics workspace.

## Why export the alert logs
After exporting the alert logs generated by Secure Center to a workspace, you can then run these logs through the analytic tools available in Azure Monitor.

## Prerequisites
You need a Log Analytics workspace.  You cannot export log alerts to the Security Center default workspace. However, if you already set a [Log Analytics workspace for data collection](security-center-enable-data-collection.md#using-an-existing-workspace), then we recommend you use that same workspace to export the logs to. This is further explained in the steps below.

1. Click **Security Policy**.
1. Click on a subscription and then click **Edit Settings**.
1. Under the data collection settings, scroll down to **Store Security Center enriched data** and click the toggle option to **on**.

   ![Store data option](./media/security-center-alert-export/store_data_option.png "Security Policy")
1. Select the workspace that you want to export the alerts to.
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot use the default workspace. We recommend that you use the same Log Analytics workspace that you created when setting for collecting data. [Log Analytics workspace for data collection](security-center-enable-data-collection.md#using-an-existing-workspace)

1. Click **Save** (at the top of the screen).
1. Check the Log Analytics workspace and see that it is consistent with the data in Security Center.
