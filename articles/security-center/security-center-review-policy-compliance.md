# Review Security Center policy compliance using REST APIs

In [Managing security recommendations in Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations), you learn how to use  Security Center to monitor compliance with your security policies.  Here, you learn to do so using Azure REST APIs.  

To retrieve the current set of recommendations:
```  
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Security/tasks?api-version={api-version}
Content-Type: application/json   
Authorization: Bearer
```

## Request  
HTTPS is required for all service requests. 

The `{subscription-id}` parameter is required and should contain the subscription ID for the Azure subscription defining the policies.  You can get the subscription ID from the Azure portal.  Choose **All services** and then use the Filter to find Subscriptions. 

The `api-version` parameter is required. At this time, these endpoints are supported only for `api-version=2015-06-01-preview`.  The current version is `api-version=2016-09-01`. To learn more about versions, see See [API versions in Azure Search](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=834796) for a list of available versions.  

### Request Headers  
 The following table describes the required and optional request headers.  

|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|*Content-Type:*|Required. Set this to `application/json`|  
|*Authorization: Bearer*|Required. Set this to a valid [access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/#authorization-code-grant-interactive-clients). |  

### Response  
Status code 200 (OK) is returned for a successful response, which contains a list of recommendation tasks.

The response object contains list of 
``` javascript
{  
  "value": [  
    {  
       "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{region}/tasks/{task-id}",
       "name": "{task_id}",
       "type": "Microsoft.Security/locations/{region}/tasks",
       "properties": {
       "state": "Active",
       "subState": "NA",
       "creationTimeUtc": "{create-time}",
       "lastStateChangeTimeUtc": "{last-state-change}",
       "securityTaskParameters": "{security-task-properties}"
    } // , ... 
  ]  
}  
```  

Each item in **value** represents a recommendation:

| Response property | Description |
|---------------- |----------|
| **state** | Indicates whether recommendation is `active` or `resolved `. |
| **creationTimeUtc** | Date and time, in UTC, showing when the recommendation was created. |
| **lastStateChange** | Date and time, in UTV, of the last state change, if any. |
| **securityTaskParameters** | Details the recommendation; properties vary according to the underlying recommendation. | 

For currently supported recommendations, see [Implement security recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations).


Other status codes indicate error conditions.  In these cases, the response object includes a description explaining why the request failed.

``` javascript
{  
  "value": [  
    {  
      "description": "Error response describing why the operation failed."  
    }  
  ]  
}  
```  


## Example  

``` javascript
{  
  "value": [  
        {
            "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{region}/tasks/{task-id}",
            "name": "{task_id}",
            "type": "Microsoft.Security/locations/{region}/tasks",
            "properties": {
                "state": "Active",
                "subState": "NA",
                "creationTimeUtc": "{create-time}",
                "lastStateChangeTimeUtc": "{last-state-change}",
                "securityTaskParameters": {
                    "vmId": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm_name}",
                    "vmName": "{vm_name}",
                    "severity": "{severity}",
                    "isOsDiskEncrypted": {is_os_disk_encrypted},
                    "isDataDiskEncrypted": {is_data_disk_encrypted},
                    "name": "{recommendation_name}",
                    "uniqueKey": "EncryptionOnVmTaskParameters_/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resoource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm_name}",
                    "resourceId": "/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm_name}"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{location}/tasks/{task-id}",
            "name": "{task-id}",
            "type": "Microsoft.Security/locations/{region}/tasks",
            "properties": {
                "state": "Active",
                "subState": "NA",
                "creationTimeUtc": "{create-time}",
                "lastStateChangeTimeUtc": "{last-state-change}",
                "securityTaskParameters": {
                    "serverName": "{sql-server-name}",
                    "serverId": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/{server-id}",
                    "name": "Enable auditing for the SQL server",
                    "uniqueKey": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/{server-id}/auditingPolicies/Default",
                    "resourceId": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/{server-id}"
                }
            }
        }  ]  
}  
```  

This example shows two recommendations; each item in the list corresponds to a specific recommendation.  The first recommends encrypting storage on a virtual machine and the second suggests that you enable auditing for a SQL server.

The recommendations vary according to the policies you've enabled.  To learn more, including the currently available recommendations, see [Managing security recommendations in Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations).
