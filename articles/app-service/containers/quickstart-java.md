# Create a Java web app in Azure App Service on Linux

> [!NOTE]
> This article deploys an app to App Service on Linux.
>

[App Service on Linux](app-service-linux-intro.md) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service using the Linux operating system. This quickstart shows how to deploy a Java app to App Service on Linux using a built-in image. You create the web app with built-in image using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), and you use Git to deploy the Java code to the web app.

![Sample app running in Azure](media/quickstart-java/java-hello-world-in-browser.png)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Download the sample

In a terminal window on your machine, run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-docs-hello-world
```

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Configure deployment user](../../../includes/configure-deployment-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create resource group](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-resource-group.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create app service plan](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-app-service-plan-linux.md)]


## Create a web app

In the Cloud Shell, create a [web app](../articles/app-service/app-service-web-overview.md) in the `myAppServicePlan` App Service plan. You can do it by using the [`az webapp create`](/cli/azure/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az_webapp_create) command. In the following example, replace *\<app_name>* with a globally unique app name (valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`). 

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp create --name <app_name> --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --deployment-local-git --runtime "TOMCAT|8.5-jre8"
```

When the web app has been created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example:

```json
Local git is configured with url of 'https://<username>@<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app_name>.git'
{
  "availabilityState": "Normal",
  "clientAffinityEnabled": true,
  "clientCertEnabled": false,
  "cloningInfo": null,
  "containerSize": 0,
  "dailyMemoryTimeQuota": 0,
  "defaultHostName": "<app_name>.azurewebsites.net",
  "deploymentLocalGitUrl": "https://<username>@<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app_name>.git",
  "enabled": true,
  < JSON data removed for brevity. >
}
```

Youâ€™ve created an empty web app, with git deployment enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The URL of the Git remote is shown in the `deploymentLocalGitUrl` property, with the format `https://<username>@<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app_name>.git`. Save this URL as you need it later.
>

Browse to the newly created web app.

```
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net
```

Here is what your new web app should look like at this time:

## Browse to the app

Browse to the deployed application using your web browser.

```bash
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net
```

The Java sample code is running in a web app with built-in image.

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your first Java app to App Service on Linux.
