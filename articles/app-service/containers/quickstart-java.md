# Create a Java web app in Azure App Service on Linux

> [!NOTE]
> This article deploys an app to App Service on Linux.
>

[App Service on Linux](app-service-linux-intro.md) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service using the Linux operating system. This quickstart shows how to deploy a Java app to App Service on Linux using a built-in image. You create the web app with built-in image using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), and you use Git to deploy the Java code to the web app.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Download the sample

In a terminal window on your machine, run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-docs-hello-world
```

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Configure deployment user](../../../includes/configure-deployment-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create resource group](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-resource-group.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create app service plan](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-app-service-plan-linux.md)]

## Create a web app

[!INCLUDE [Create web app](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-web-app-java.md)]

Browse to your newly created web app. Replace _&lt;app name>_ with your web app name.

```bash
http://<app name>.azurewebsites.net
```

Here is what your new web app should look like:

```

## Browse to the app

Browse to the deployed application using your web browser.

```bash
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net
```

The Java sample code is running in a web app with built-in image.

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your first Java app to App Service on Linux.

## Manage your new Azure web app

Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> to manage the web app you created.

From the left menu, click **App Services**, and then click the name of your Azure web app.

![Portal navigation to Azure web app](./media/quickstart-java/java-docs-hello-world-app-service-list.png)

You see your web app's Overview page. Here, you can perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete.

The left menu provides different pages for configuring your app.
