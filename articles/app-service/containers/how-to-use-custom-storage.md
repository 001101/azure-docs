# Bring your own storage in App Service Linux

## Introduction

App Service now supports "Bring your own storage" (preview) for App Service Linux and Web App for Containers. This article uses Azure Storage to link to a WordPress app. You can read more about "Bring your own storage".

Bring your own storage is in preview and currently limited to the AZ CLI client. You can use API and Storage Explorer to transfer files. You can configure up to five Azure storage accounts for a given App Service. 

> [!CAUTION]
> This is currently in preview. If your WordPress app contains images in the uploads folder, you should make full backup of the app before continuing.
> Linking a storage account to the uploads directory of an existing WordPress app will delete the contents.

        az storage account keys list -g myResourceGroup -n mybyos
