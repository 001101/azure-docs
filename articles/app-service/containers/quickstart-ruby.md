# Create a Ruby web app in a Linux container in Azure

[!INCLUDE [app-service-linux-preview](../../../includes/app-service-linux-preview.md)]

[Azure Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-web/app-service-web-overview) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. This quickstart shows you how to create a basic Ruby on Rails application you then deploy it to Azure as a Web App on Linux. You create the web app using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), and you use Git to deploy the Ruby code to the web app.

![Hello-world](./media/quickstart-ruby/hello-world-updated.png)

## Prerequisites

* [Ruby 2.4.1 or higher](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rubyinstaller).
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Download the sample

In a terminal window, run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ruby-docs-hello-world
```

## Run the app locally

Run the rails server in order for the application to work. Change to the *hello-world* directory, and the `rails server` command starts the server.

```bash
cd hello-world\bin
rails server
```
	
Using your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to test the app locally.

In your terminal window, press **Ctrl+C** to exit the web server.

[!INCLUDE [Configure deployment user](../../../includes/configure-deployment-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create resource group](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-resource-group.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create app service plan](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-app-service-plan-linux.md)]

## Create a web app

Create a [web app](../../app-service-web/app-service-web-overview.md) in the `myAppServicePlan` App Service plan with the [az webapp create](/cli/azure/webapp#create) command. Don't forget to replace `<app name>` with a unique app name.

Notice that the runtime is set to `ruby|2.3`. 

```azurecli-interactive
  az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name <app name> --runtime "ruby|2.3" --deployment-local-git
```

> [!TIP]
> Setting the runtime this way uses a default container provided by the platform. You can bring your own docker container using the [az webapp config container set](/cli/azure/webapp/config/container#set) command.

[!INCLUDE [Create web app](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-web-app-result.md)] 

![Splash page](./media/quickstart-ruby/splash-page.png)

Youâ€™ve created an empty new web app in a Linux container, with git deployment enabled.

[!INCLUDE [Push to Azure](../../../includes/app-service-web-git-push-to-azure.md)] 

```bash
remote: Using sass-rails 5.0.6
remote: Updating files in vendor/cache
remote: Bundle gems are installed into ./vendor/bundle
remote: Updating files in vendor/cache
remote: ~site/repository
remote: Finished successfully.
remote: Running post deployment command(s)...
remote: Deployment successful.
To https://<your web app name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<your web app name>.git
  579ccb....2ca5f31  master -> master
myuser@ubuntu1234:~workspace/<app name>$
```

## Browse to the app locally

Browse to the deployed application using your web browser.

```bash
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net
```

The Ruby sample code is running in an Azure App Service web app.

![updated web app](./media/quickstart-ruby/hello-world-updated.png)

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your first PHP app to App Service.

## Update locally and redeploy the code

Using a local text editor, open the `hello-world/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file within the PHP app, and make a small change to the text within the string next to `echo`:

```php
echo "Hello Azure!";
```

Commit your changes in Git, and then push the code changes to Azure.

```bash
git commit -am "updated output"
git push azure master
```

Once deployment has completed, switch back to the browser window that opened in the **Browse to the app** step, and refresh the page.

## Manage your new Azure web app

Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> to manage the web app you created.

From the left menu, click **App Services**, and then click the name of your Azure web app.

![Portal navigation to Azure web app](./media/quickstart-php/php-docs-hello-world-app-service-list.png)

You see your web app's Overview page. Here, you can perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete.

The left menu provides different pages for configuring your app.
