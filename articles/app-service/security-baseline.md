# App Service security baseline for Azure Security Benchmark

The Azure Security Baseline for App Service contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4438).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure network resources and network configurations related to your Azure App Service web apps and APIs.

Network security groups (NSGs) allow you to restrict network access and control the number of exposed endpoints. If using Network Security groups with your Azure App Service web apps and APIs implementation, enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audits. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4439).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure network resources and network configurations related to your Azure App Service web apps and APIs.

For the public multi-tenant variation of Azure App Service, the recommendation is to use the access restrictions capability built into App Service. This can also be used for the single tenant App Service Environment (ASE) variation. This is similar to the Network Security Group (NSG) feature.

The App Service Environment is a deployment of Azure App Service in the subnet of a customer's Azure virtual network. It can be deployed with a public or private endpoint for app access. The deployment of the App Service Environment with a private endpoint (that is, an internal load balancer) is called an ILB App Service Environment.

Web application firewalls help secure your web applications by inspecting inbound web traffic to block SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting, malware uploads &amp; application DDoS and other attacks. It also inspects the responses from the back-end web servers for Data Loss Prevention (DLP). You can get a WAF device from the Azure marketplace or you can use the Azure Application Gateway.

The Azure Application Gateway is a virtual appliance that provides layer 7 load balancing, SSL offloading, and web application firewall (WAF) protection.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4444).

**Guidance**: If using Network Security groups (NSGs) or Azure Firewall with your Azure App Service web apps, you can use Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., AzureAppService) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

* [For more information about using service tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4445).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your Azure App Service web apps. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Web" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure App Service web apps. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions for Azure App Service, such as:
- App Service should use a virtual network service endpoint
- Web Application should only be accessible over HTTPS
- Latest TLS version should be used in your Web App

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, role-based access control (RBAC), and policies in a single blueprint definition. You can easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

## Data recovery

*For more information, see [Security control: Data recovery](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back ups

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4514).

**Guidance**: The Backup and Restore feature in Azure App Service lets you easily create app backups manually or on a schedule. You can configure the backups to be retained up to an indefinite amount of time. You can restore the app to a snapshot of a previous state by overwriting the existing app or restoring to another app.

App Service can back up the following information to an Azure storage account and container that you have configured your app to use:
- App configuration
- File content
- Database connected to your app

The following database solutions are supported with the backup feature:
- SQL Database
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- MySQL in-app

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer managed keys

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4517).

**Guidance**: Azure App Service backups are stored within an Azure Storage account. Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Azure Storage encryption is similar to BitLocker encryption on Windows.

Azure Storage encryption is enabled for all storage accounts, including both Resource Manager and classic storage accounts. Azure Storage encryption cannot be disabled. Because your data is secured by default, you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of Azure Storage encryption.

By default, data in a storage account is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your data, or you can manage encryption with your own keys. Ensure soft delete is enabled in Azure Key Vault.

* [Understand Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption)

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4519).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.
