# Azure security baseline for App Service

The Azure Security Baseline for App Service contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4437).

**Guidance**: 
An App Service Environment (ASE) refers to a deployment of Microsoft Azure App Service into a subnet within an Azure Virtual Network. 

Use network security groups to secure an ASE by blocking inbound and outbound traffic to resources in the virtual network, or restricting access to the apps on an ASE. 

Any allow rules need to be built, as network security groups include an implicit deny rule at the lowest priority to deny everything at the Azure portal. 
No access is available to the VMs being used to host the ASE as they're in a Microsoft-managed subscription.

A network security group that's applied to an integration subnet is in effect regardless of any routes applied to the integration subnet. Two types of ASE exist, an External ASE, and ILB (Internal Load Balancer) ASE.

ASEs can additionally be protected with an Azure Application Gateway enabled Web Application Firewall (WAF) which operates at Layer 7 with OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities protection.  

In the multi-tenant App Service, use network security groups to block outbound traffic. Use Virtual Network integration to make outbound calls from an app into its Virtual Network. Block traffic to public addresses from an the application by using regional Virtual Network Integration with the app setting WEBSITE_VIRTUAL NETWORK_ROUTE_ALL set to 1 (one).  The inbound rules do not apply because Virtual Network Integration can't be used to provide inbound access to an app.  

Secure Inbound traffic to your app with:

Access Restrictions: a series of allow or deny rules that control inbound access
Service Endpoints: enable you to secure traffic to originating from a set of virtual networks or subnets
Private Endpoints: expose your app on an address in your Virtual Network. With these enabled on your app, it is no longer internet accessible.

Use network security groups and route tables (UDR) when using Virtual Network integration with virtual networks in the same region. UDRs can be placed on the integration subnet to send outbound traffic where intended.

You can combine access restrictions and service endpoints but you cannot use Private Endpoints in conjunction with access restrictions and service endpoints.  

An Azure Firewall could also be used to centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across your subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for virtual network resources which allows outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4438).

**Guidance**: Implement Security Center's network protection recommendations to secure network resources and configurations related to your App Service Web Apps and APIs.

Use Azure Firewall to send traffic and centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. 

Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources allowing outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network. The service is fully integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4439).

**Guidance**: Secure an internet accessible app in an App Service Environment (ASE) by:

•	Deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Azure Application Gateway in front of your internet facing apps

•	Use access restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the Application Gateway 

•	Secure applications with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to ensure authentication

•	Disable TLS 1.2 on the app

•	Set the app to HTTPS only 

•	Drive all application traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs. Follow recommendations in the Locking down an App Service Environment guidance.

To secure an internet accessible app in the multi-tenant App Service:

•	Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) enabled device in front of your apps

•	Use access restrictions or service endpoints to secure inbound traffic to the WAF device

•	Secure applications with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to ensure authentication

•	Disable TLS 1.2 on the app

•	Set the app to HTTPS only 

•	Use Virtual network Integration and the app setting WEBSITE_VIRTUAL NETWORK_ROUTE_ALL to make all outbound traffic subject to NSGs and UDRs on the integration subnet.

•	Drive all application traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4440).

**Guidance**: Use Security Center's Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused public IP addresses. 

•	Secure the App Service Environment (ASE) as described in Locking down an App Service Environment 

•	Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) enabled application gateway in front of your internet facing apps

•	Use access restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the application gateway 

Use the virtual network integration feature to restrict incoming source IP addresses based on need, or if deemed malicious, with network security groups. This process allows placing many Azure resources in a non-internet-routable with network access restrictions and controls.

For the Multi-tenant App Service, use a public internet facing endpoint to allow traffic only from a specific subnet within an Azure Virtual Network and block everything else. 

Use Access Restrictions to configure network ACLs (IP Restrictions) to lock down allowed inbound traffic. Define priority among the ordered allow/deny list to control network access to your app with Access Restrictions. This list can include IP addresses or Virtual Network subnets. An implicit "deny all" rule exists at the end of the list when it contains one or more entries. This capability works with all App Service hosted work loads including, Web Apps, API apps, Linux apps, Linux container apps, and Functions. The ability to restrict access to your web app from an Azure Virtual Network is called service endpoint. 

Service endpoints enable you to restrict access to a multi-tenant App Service from selected subnets. It must be enabled on both the networking side as well as the service that it is being enabled. Note that this does not work to restrict traffic to apps that are hosted in an App Service Environment. If you are in an ASE, you can control access to your app with IP address rules.

### 1.5: Record network packets

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4441).

**Guidance**: Security Center monitors requests and responses sent to and from apps running in App Service. Attacks against a web application can be monitored by using a real-time Web Application Firewall (WAF) enabled Application Gateway providing integrated logging with Azure Monitor to track WAF alerts and easily monitor trends.

Use Microsoft Azure Sentinel to access the built-in Azure WAF firewall events workbook to get an overview of the security events on your WAF. This includes events, matched and blocked rules, and everything else that gets logged in the firewall logs.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4442).

**Guidance**: Not applicable to App Service. This capability is not built into the platform directly. 
Use a third-party application in the Azure Marketplace offering this capability.

Using service endpoints, (review this scenario)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4443).

**Guidance**: For an app in an App Service Environment (ASE):

•	Secure the ASE as described in Locking down an App Service Environment 

•	Deploy an Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) enabled Application Gateway in front of your internet facing apps

•	Use access restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the Application Gateway 

•	Set the app to HTTPS only 

•	Drive all application-traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

If you want to secure an internet accessible app in the multi-tenant service:

•	Deploy a WAF enabled device in front of your apps

•	Use access restrictions or service endpoints to secure inbound traffic to the WAF device

•	Set the app to HTTPS only 

•	Use Virtual Network Integration and the app setting WEBSITE_VIRTUAL NETWORK_ROUTE_ALL to make all outbound traffic subject to NSGs and UDRs on the integration subnet.

•	Drive all application-traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

Restrict access to your Web Apps with App Service’s static IP restrictions so that it only receives traffic from the VIP on an application gateway as the only address with access.

With Access restrictions, you can define a priority ordered allow/deny list that controls network access to your app. The list can include IP addresses or Azure Virtual Network subnets. When there are one or more entries, there is then an implicit "deny all" that exists at the end of the list.

The access restrictions capability works with all App Service hosted work loads including: Web Apps, API apps, Linux apps, Linux container apps, and Functions.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4444).

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall with App Service Web Apps.

You can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service by specifying the service tag name in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4445).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your App Service Web Apps. 

Maintain security configurations using Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Web" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces. Create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your App Service Web Apps. 

Use built-in policy definitions for App Service, such as:

•	App Service should use a virtual network service endpoint

•	Web Application should only be accessible over HTTPS

•	Latest TLS version should be used in your Web App

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4446).

**Guidance**: Use tags for the network security groups and other resources related to network security and traffic flow in App Service Web Apps.

Specify business need, duration, and so on, with the "Description" field  or any rules which allow traffic to or from a network for individual network security groups rules.

Apply any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value", effects to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of any existing untagged resources. Use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4447).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity Log to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes for network settings and resources related to App Service resources. 

Use one of the several Azure Policy built-in definitions for App Service. For example, a policy which audits any app not configured to use virtual network endpoint service. Create alerts within Azure Monitor to trigger when changes to critical network settings or resources takes place. 

View Security Center generated detailed security alerts and recommendations in the portal or through programmatic tools. Export this information or send it to other monitoring tools in your environment. Tools are available to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. Using these tools, you can:

•	Continuously export to Log Analytics workspaces

•	Continuously export to Azure Event Hubs (for integrations with third-party SIEMs)

•	Export to CSV (one time)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4461).

**Guidance**: Authenticate App Service through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD provides an OAuth 2.0 service for your identity provider and enables authorized access to mobile and web applications. 

App Service apps use federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider manages the user identities and authentication flow for you. Five identity providers are available by default:

•	Azure Active Directory

•	Microsoft Account

•	Facebook

•	Google

•	Twitter

When you enable authentication and authorization with one of these providers, its sign-in endpoint is available for user authentication and for validation of authentication tokens from the provider.

**Guidance**: Implement separate subscriptions and management groups for development, test, and production.

Deploy your App Service web app into a Virtual Network. Perimeter security in App Service is achieved through virtual networks. 

For Multi-tenant App Service, Virtual network. Integration gives your app access to resources in your Virtual network. but it doesn't grant inbound private access to your app from the Virtual network. Private site access refers to making an app accessible only from a private network, such as from within an Azure Virtual network. 

Virtual Network Integration is used only to make outbound calls from your app into your Virtual Network. The Virtual Network. Integration feature behaves differently when it's used with Virtual network in the same region and with Virtual network  in other regions. The Virtual network. Integration feature has two variations:

•	Regional Virtual network Integration: When you connect to Azure Resource Manager virtual networks in the same region, you must have a dedicated subnet in the Virtual network. you're integrating with.

•	Gateway-required Virtual network. Integration: When you connect to Virtual Network in other regions or to a classic virtual network in the same region, you need an Azure Virtual Network gateway provisioned in the target Virtual Network.

## Malware defense

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Malware defense](../security/benchmarks/security-control-malware-defense.md).*

### 8.1: Use centrally-managed anti-malware software

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4511).

**Guidance**: Not applicable to App Service. This recommendation is intended for IaaS compute resources.

The platform components of App Service, including Azure VMs, storage, network connections, web frameworks, management and integration features, are actively secured and hardened. App Service goes through vigorous compliance checks on a continuous basis to make sure that 24-hour threat management protects the infrastructure and platform against malware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), man-in-the-middle (MITM), and other threats.

Microsoft anti-malware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services (for example, Azure Functions), however it does not run on customer content.

## Data recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back-ups

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4514).

**Guidance**: The Backup and Restore feature in App Service lets you easily create app backups manually or on a schedule. You can configure the backups to be retained up to an indefinite amount of time. You can restore the app to a snapshot of a previous state by overwriting the existing app or restoring to another app.

App Service can back up the following information to an Azure storage account and container that you have configured your app to use:

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4517).

**Guidance**: App Service backups are stored within an Azure Storage account. Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Azure Storage encryption is similar to BitLocker encryption on Windows.

Azure Storage encryption is enabled for all storage accounts, including both Resource Manager and classic storage accounts. Azure Storage encryption cannot be disabled. Because your data is secured by default, you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of Azure Storage encryption.

By default, data in a storage account is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your data, or you can manage encryption with your own keys. Ensure soft delete is enabled in Azure Key Vault.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4519).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.
