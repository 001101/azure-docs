# Azure security baseline for App Service

The Azure Security Baseline for App Service contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: 
App Service helps provide perimeter security for virtual networks. An App Service Environment (ASE) is a deployment of Azure App Service into a subnet in an Azure Virtual Network. An ASE can be secured with network security groups to block inbound and outbound traffic to the resources in a Virtual network. There are two types of ASEs: External ASE, and ILB (Internal Load Balancer) ASE.

Network security groups include an implicit deny rule at the lowest priority to deny everything at the Azure portal, and any allow rules are required to be built. Network security groups can be applied on the ASE subnet in order to restrict access to the apps on the ASE. A network security group that's applied to an integration subnet is in effect regardless of any routes applied to the integration subnet. 

You can also use Azure Firewall to centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources allowing outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network. The service is fully integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics. ASEs can be protected by an Application Gateway with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) at Layer 7 with OWASP Top protection. 

No access is available to the VMs being used to host the ASE as they're in a Microsoft-managed subscription. 

In the multi-tenant App Service, network security groups can be used to block outbound traffic. To block traffic to public addresses, the application must be using regional Virtual network Integration and have the app setting WEBSITE_VIRTUAL NETWORK_ROUTE_ALL set to 1 (one). The inbound rules in a network security group don't apply to an app because Virtual Network integration affects only outbound traffic from your app. 

The Virtual Network integration feature is used in multi-tenant apps. Virtual Network integration is used only to make outbound calls from an app into its Virtual network. When using Virtual Network integration with virtual networks in the same region, network security groups, and route tables (UDRs) can be used:

- The inbound rules don't apply because Virtual network Integration can't be used to provide inbound access to an app

- Route tables (UDRs) can be placed on the integration subnet to send outbound traffic where intended

Inbound traffic to your app can be secured with:

- Access Restrictions: a series of allow/deny rules that control inbound access

- Service Endpoints: enable you to secure traffic to originating from a set of Virtual network/subnets

- Private Endpoints: expose your app on an address in your Virtual network. With these enabled on your app, it is no longer internet accessible.

You can combine access restrictions and service endpoints but you cannot use Private Endpoints in conjunction with access restrictions and service endpoints.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: No

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure network resources and network configurations related to your Azure App Service web apps and APIs.

Send the traffic through to an Azure Firewall where you can centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources allowing outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network. The service is fully integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: In an App Service Environment, if you want to secure an internet accessible app:
•	Secure the ASE as described in Locking down an App Service Environment 

•	Deploy a WAF enabled application gateway in front of your internet facing apps

•	Use access restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the application gateway 

•	Secure applications with AAD to ensure authentication

•	Disable TLS 1.2 on the app

•	Set the app to HTTPS only 

•	Drive all application outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

If you want to secure an internet accessible app in the multi-tenant service:

•	Deploy a WAF enabled device in front of your apps

•	Use access restrictions or service endpoints to secure inbound traffic to the WAF device

•	Secure applications with AAD to ensure authentication

•	Disable TLS 1.2 on the app

•	Set the app to HTTPS only 

•	Use Virtual network Integration and the app setting WEBSITE_VIRTUAL NETWORK_ROUTE_ALL to make all outbound traffic subject to NSGs and UDRs on the integration subnet.

•	Drive all application outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

- [Locking down an App Service Environment](environment/firewall-integration.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused public IP addresses. 
•	Secure the ASE as described in Locking down an App Service Environment 

•	Deploy a WAF enabled application gateway in front of your internet facing apps

•	Use access restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the application gateway 

Use the virtual network integration feature to restrict incoming source IP addresses through network security groups (NSGs). This allows placing many Azure resources in a non-internet, routable network access restrictions and controls.

APP Service Multi-tenant has a public internet facing endpoint which can be used to allow traffic only from a specific subnet within an Azure Virtual Network and block everything else. 

You can also use Access Restrictions to configure network ACLs (IP Restrictions) to lock down allowed inbound traffic. With Access restrictions, you can define a priority ordered allow/deny list that controls network access to your app. The list can include IP addresses or Azure Virtual Network subnets. When there are one or more entries, there is then an implicit "deny all" that exists at the end of the list.

The access restrictions capability works with all App Service hosted work loads including; web apps, API apps, Linux apps, Linux container apps, and Functions. The ability to restrict access to your web app from an Azure Virtual Network (Virtual network) is called service endpoint. 

You can define a list of IP addresses in an allowed list for Azure App Service on Windows that can access your app. The allowed list can include individual IP addresses, or a range of IP addresses defined by a subnet mask. 

Service endpoints enable you to restrict access to a multi-tenant service from selected subnets. It must be enabled on both the networking side as well as the service that it is being enabled with. It does not work to restrict traffic to apps that are hosted in an App Service Environment. If you are in an App Service Environment, you can control access to your app with IP address rules.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.5: Record network packets

**Guidance**: Azure security Center monitors requests and responses sent to and from apps running in App Service. Attacks can be monitored against a web application by using a real-time WAF enabled Application Gateway providing integrated logging with Azure Monitor to track WAF alerts and easily monitor trends.

If using Microsoft Azure Sentinel, you can access the built-in Azure WAF firewall events workbook to get an overview of the security events on your WAF. This includes events, matched and blocked rules, and everything else that gets logged in the firewall logs.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

**Guidance**: For an app in an App Service Environment (ASE):

•	Secure the ASE as described in Locking down an App Service Environment 

•	Deploy a WAF enabled application gateway in front of your internet facing apps

•	Use access restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the application gateway 

•	Set the app to HTTPS only 

•	Drive all application outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

If you want to secure an internet accessible app in the multi-tenant service:

•	Deploy a WAF enabled device in front of your apps

•	Use access restrictions or service endpoints to secure inbound traffic to the WAF device

•	Set the app to HTTPS only 

•	Use Virtual network Integration and the app setting WEBSITE_VIRTUAL NETWORK_ROUTE_ALL to make all outbound traffic subject to NSGs and UDRs on the integration subnet.

•	Drive all application outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

Restrict access to your web apps with Azure App Service’s static IP restrictions so that it only receives traffic from the VIP on an application gateway as the only address with access.

With Access restrictions, you can define a priority ordered allow/deny list that controls network access to your app. The list can include IP addresses or Azure Virtual Network subnets. When there are one or more entries, there is then an implicit "deny all" that exists at the end of the list.

The access restrictions capability works with all App Service hosted work loads including; web apps, API apps, Linux apps, Linux container apps, and Functions.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Virtual Network service tags can be used to define network access controls on Network Security Groups (NSG) or Azure Firewall with Azure App Service web apps.

By specifying the service tag name in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

- [For more information about using service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your Azure App Service web apps. 

You can maintain config using policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Web" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure App Service web apps. 

You may also make use of built-in policy definitions for Azure App Service, such as:

•	App Service should use a virtual network service endpoint

•	Web Application should only be accessible over HTTPS

•	Latest TLS version should be used in your Web App

- [How to configure and manage Azure Policy](../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: If using Network Security groups (NSGs) with your Azure App Service web apps, use tags for the NSGs and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. 

For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources. 
You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity Log to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes for network settings and resources related to your Azure App Service resources. 

There are several Azure Policy built-in policy definitions for Azure App Service. For example, a policy audits any app service not configured to use an virtual network endpoint service. 

Create alerts within Azure Monitor that will trigger when changes to critical network settings or resources takes place.

Azure Security Center generates detailed security alerts and recommendations. You can view them in the portal or through programmatic tools. You may also need to export this information or send it to other monitoring tools in your environment. Tools are available to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. Using these tools, you can:

•	Continuously export to Log Analytics workspaces

•	Continuously export to Azure Event Hubs (for integrations with third-party SIEMs)

•	Export to CSV (one time)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

**Guidance**: Authenticate through Azure Active Directory (AD). App Service provides an OAuth 2.0 service for your identity provider. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, and mobile phones. Azure AD uses OAuth 2.0 to enable you to authorize access to mobile and web applications. 

Implement single sign-on for your Azure App Service apps using a built-in identity provider. Azure App Service apps uses federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider manages the user identities and authentication flow for you. Five identity providers are available by default:

•	Azure Active Directory

•	Microsoft Account

•	Facebook

•	Google

•	Twitter

When you enable authentication and authorization with one of these providers, its sign-in endpoint is available for user authentication and for validation of authentication tokens from the provider.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: Implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production.

Deploy your Azure App Service web app into a Virtual Network (VNet). Perimeter security in App Service is achieved through VNets. 

The App Service Environment (ASE) is a deployment of Azure App Service into a subnet in your Azure Virtual network.. There are two types of ASE, External ASE and ILB (Internal Load Balancer) ASE.

For Multi-tenant App Service, Virtual network. Integration gives your app access to resources in your Virtual network. but it doesn't grant inbound private access to your app from the Virtual network.. Private site access refers to making an app accessible only from a private network, such as from within an Azure virtual network. 

Virtual network. Integration is used only to make outbound calls from your app into your Virtual network.. The Virtual network. Integration feature behaves differently when it's used with Virtual network in the same region and with Virtual network  in other regions. The Virtual network. Integration feature has two variations:

•	Regional Virtual network Integration: When you connect to Azure Resource Manager virtual networks in the same region, you must have a dedicated subnet in the Virtual network. you're integrating with.

•	Gateway-required Virtual network. Integration: When you connect to VNet in other regions or to a classic virtual network in the same region, you need an Azure Virtual Network gateway provisioned in the target VNet.
