# Azure security baseline for App Service

The Azure Security Baseline for App Service contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment. The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to App Service. **Controls** not applicable to App Service have been excluded.

To see how App Service completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full App Service security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4437).

**Guidance**: 
Deploy an Azure App into a subnet within your Azure Virtual Network. This type of deployment is called an App Service Environment (ASE). Use network security groups to secure a Microsoft Azure App Service Environment by blocking inbound and outbound traffic to resources in your virtual network, or to restrict access to apps in an App Service Environment . 

Build Allow rules based on your requirements. This is because network security groups include an implicit Deny rule at the lowest priority to deny everything at the Azure portal. No access is available to the virtual machines being used to host the App Service Environment as they're in a Microsoft-managed subscription.

Protect App Service Environment with an Azure Application Gateway enabled Web Application Firewall (WAF) which operates at Layer 7 with Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 vulnerabilities protection.  

In the multi-tenant App Service, use network security groups to block outbound traffic. Enable your apps to access resources in or through a Virtual Network, with the Virtual Network Integration feature. This feature can also be used to block traffic to public addresses from the app. Virtual Network Integration cannot be used to provide inbound access to an app.  

Secure Inbound traffic to your app with:
- Access Restrictions - a series of allow or deny rules that control inbound access
- Service Endpoints - enable you to secure traffic to originating from a set of virtual networks or subnets
- Private Endpoints - expose your app on an address in your Virtual Network. With these enabled on your app, it is no longer internet accessible

Use network security groups and route tables with user-defined routes, when using Virtual Network Integration feature with virtual networks in the same region. User-defined routes can be placed on the integration subnet to send outbound traffic as intended.  

Consider implementing an Azure Firewall to centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across your subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for virtual network resources, which allows outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4438).

**Guidance**: Implement network protection recommendations from Security Center to secure network resources and configurations related to your App Service Web Apps and APIs.

Use Azure Firewall to send traffic and centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. 

Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources, which allows outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your Virtual Network. The Azure Firewall service is also fully integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4439).

**Guidance**: Secure an internet accessible app in an App Service Environment (ASE) by:
- Deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Azure Application Gateway in front of your internet facing apps

- Use Access Restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the Application Gateway 

- Secure applications with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to ensure authentication

- Set minimum TLS version to 1.2

- Set the app to HTTPS only 

- Drive all application traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs. 

Follow recommendations in the Locking down an App Service Environment document.

To secure an internet accessible app in the multi-tenant App Service:

- Deploy a WAF enabled device in front of your apps

- Use Access Restrictions or service endpoints to secure inbound traffic to the WAF device

- Secure applications with Azure AD to ensure authentication

- Set minimum TLS version to 1.2

- Set the app to HTTPS only 

- Use Virtual network Integration and the app setting WEBSITE_VIRTUAL NETWORK_ROUTE_ALL to make all outbound traffic subject to network security groups and user-defined routes on the integration subnet.

- Drive all application traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4440).

**Guidance**: Secure the App Service Environment as described in the Locking down an App Service Environment documentation. Apply Security Center's Integrated Threat Intelligence features to deny communications with known-malicious or unused public IP addresses. Use Access Restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the Application Gateway 

For the multi-tenant App Service, use a public internet facing endpoint to allow traffic only from a specific subnet within your Virtual Network and blocking everything else. Use Access Restrictions to configure network ACLs (IP Restrictions) to lock down allowed inbound traffic.

Define priority among the ordered allow/deny list to manage network access to your app. This list can include IP addresses or Virtual Network subnets. An implicit "deny all" rule exists at the end of the list when it contains one or more entries. This capability works with all App Service hosted work loads including, Web Apps, API apps, Linux apps, Linux container apps, and Functions. 

Use service endpoints to restrict access to your web app from an Azure Virtual Network. Limit access to a multi-tenant App Service from selected subnets with service endpoints.

### 1.5: Record network packets

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4441).

**Guidance**: Security Center monitors requests and responses sent to and from apps running in App Service. Attacks against a web application can be monitored by using a real-time Web Application Firewall enabled Application Gateway, which uses integrated logging with Azure Monitor to track Web Application Firewall alerts and easily monitor trends.

Use Microsoft Azure Sentinel to access the built-in Azure Web Application Firewall events workbook to get an overview of the security events on your Web Application Firewall. This includes events, matched and blocked rules, and everything else that gets logged in the firewall logs.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4442).

**Guidance**: Not applicable to App Service. This capability is not built into the platform directly. 
Prevent access to a multi-tenant App Service from selected subnets with service endpoints. Service endpoints must be enabled on both the networking side as well as the service that it is being enabled. Note that this does not work to restrict traffic to apps that are hosted in an Application Service Environment. If you are in an Application Service Environment, you can control access to your app with IP address rules.

Use a third-party application in the Azure Marketplace offering a complete IDS or IPS capabilities.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4443).

**Guidance**: For an app in an App Service Environment:
- Secure the App Service Environment as described in Locking down an App Service Environment
- Deploy an Azure Web Application Firewall enabled Application Gateway in front of your internet facing apps
- Use Access Restrictions to secure inbound traffic to the Application Gateway
- Set the app to HTTPS only
- Drive all application-traffic outbound through an Azure Firewall device and monitor the logs

To secure an internet accessible app in the multi-tenant App Service:
- Deploy a Web Application Firewall enabled device in front of your apps
- Use Access Restrictions or service endpoints to secure inbound traffic to the WAF device. The access restrictions capability works with all App Service hosted work loads including Web Apps, API apps, Linux apps, Linux container apps, and Functions.- Set the app to HTTPS only

- Restrict access to your Web Apps with App Service’s static IP restrictions so that it only receives traffic from the VIP on an application gateway as the only address with access.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4444).

**Guidance**: App Service has a number of endpoints which are used to manage the service. These endpoint addresses are also included in the AppServiceManagement IP service tag. The AppServiceManagement tag is only used with an App Service Environment to allow such traffic. 

You can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service by specifying the service tag name in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule. App Service inbound addresses are tracked in the AppService IP service tag. There is no IP service tag that contains the outbound addresses used by App Service.

Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4472).

**Guidance**: Implement separate subscriptions and management groups for development, test, and production. Deploy your App Service Web App into a Virtual Network. Use network security groups and subnets for further application isolation. 

For the multi-tenant App Service, use Virtual Network Integration for your app's access to resources in your Virtual network. Note that this does not grant inbound private access to your app from the Virtual network. Use private site access to make an app accessible only from a private network, such as one from within an Azure Virtual network. 

Virtual Network Integration is used only to make outbound calls from your app into your Virtual Network. The Virtual Network Integration feature behaves differently when it is used with a virtual network in the same region and with virtual networks in other regions.

### 8.1: Use centrally-managed anti-malware software

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4511).

**Guidance**: App Service does not allow anti-malware solutions to be installed on top of its resources. 

Microsoft manages the underlying platform components that comprise App Service, including Azure VMs, storage, network connections, web frameworks, management and integration features. App Service goes through vigorous compliance checks on a continuous basis to make sure that 24-hour threat management protects the infrastructure and platform against malware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), man-in-the-middle (MITM), and other threats.

Microsoft anti-malware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services (for example, Azure Functions), however it does not run on customer content.

## Data recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back-ups

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4514).

**Guidance**: The Backup and Restore feature in App Service lets you easily create app backups manually or on a schedule. You can configure the backups to be retained up to an indefinite amount of time. You can restore the app to a snapshot of a previous state by overwriting the existing app or restoring to another app.

App Service can back up the following information to an Azure storage account and container, which you have configured your app to use:
- App configuration
- File content
- Database connected to your app

Ensure that regular and automated back-ups are occurring at a frequency as defined by your organizational policies.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4517).

**Guidance**: App Service backups are stored within an Azure Storage account. Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Azure Storage encryption is similar to BitLocker encryption on Windows.

Azure Storage encryption is enabled for all storage accounts, including both Resource Manager and classic storage accounts. Azure Storage encryption cannot be disabled. Because your data is secured by default, you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of Azure Storage encryption.

By default, data in a storage account is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your data, or you can manage encryption with your own keys. Ensure soft delete is enabled in Azure Key Vault.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4519).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for example, production, non-production) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.
