# Deploy to App Service using GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. With the Azure App Service Actions for GitHub, you can automate your workflow to deploy to [Azure App Service](overview.md) using GitHub Actions.

A workflow is defined by a YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository. This definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow.

For an Azure App Service workflow, the file has three sections:

|Section  |Tasks  |
|---------|---------|
|**Authentication** | 1. Define a service principal or publish profile. <br /> 2. Create a GitHub secret. |
|**Build** | 1. Set up the environment. <br /> 2. Build the web app. |
|**Deploy** | 1. Deploy the web app. |

## Generate deployment credentials

# [User-level credentials](#tab/userlevel)

You can create a [service principal](../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md#service-principal-object) by using the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command in the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/). You can run this command using [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) in the Azure portal or by selecting the **Try it** button.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                            --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<app-name> \
                            --sdk-auth
```

In the example above, replace the placeholders with your subscription ID, resource group name, and app name. The output is a JSON object with the role assignment credentials that provide access to your App Service app similar to below. Copy this JSON object for later.

```output 
  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is always a good practice to grant minimum access. The scope in the previous example is limited to the specific App Service app and not the entire resource group.

# [App-level credentials](#tab/applevel)

You can use app-level credentials by using publish profile for your app. 

1. Go to your app service in the Azure portal. 

1. On the **Overview** page, select **Get Publish profile**.

1. Save the downloaded file. You will use the contents of the file to create a GitHub secret.

---

## Configure the GitHub secret

# [User-level credentials](#tab/userlevel)

In [GitHub](https://github.com/), browse your repository, select **Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret**.

To use [user-level credentials](#generate-deployment-credentials), paste the entire JSON output from the Azure CLI command into the secret's value field. Give the secret the name like `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.

When you configure the workflow file later, you use the secret for the input `creds` of the Azure Login action. For example:

```yaml
- uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```

# [App-level credentials](#tab/applevel)

In [GitHub](https://github.com/), browse your repository, select **Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret**.

To use [app-level credentials](#generate-deployment-credentials), paste the contents of the downloaded publish profile file into the secret's value field. Name the secret `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`.

When you configure your GitHub workflow, you use the `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` in the deploy Azure Web App action. For example:
    
```yaml
- uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  with:
    publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
```

---

## Set up the environment

Setting up the environment can be done using one of the setup actions.

|**Language**  |**Setup Action**  |
|---------|---------|
|**.NET**     | `actions/setup-dotnet` |
|**Java**     | `actions/setup-java` |
|**JavaScript** | `actions/setup-node` |
|**Python**     | `actions/setup-python` |

The following examples show the part of the workflow that sets up the environment for the various supported languages:

**JavaScript**

```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '14.x'                # set this to the node version to use

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    name: Build and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
```
**Python**

```yaml
    - name: Setup Python 3.x 
      uses: actions/setup-python@v1
      with:
        python-version: 3.x
```

**.NET**

```yaml
    - name: Setup Dotnet 2.2.300
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: '2.2.300'
```

**Java**

```yaml
    - name: Setup Java 1.8.x
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        # If your pom.xml <maven.compiler.source> version is not in 1.8.x
        # Please change the Java version to match the version in pom.xml <maven.compiler.source>
        java-version: '1.8.x'
```

## Build the web app

This depends on the language and for languages supported by Azure App Service, this section should be the standard build steps of each language.

The following examples show the part of the workflow that builds the web app, in the various supported languages.

**JavaScript**

If your app is not in the root directory, you can set `working-directory` or change for npm directory in `pushd`. 
```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '14.x'                # set this to the node version to use

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    name: Build and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
    - name: npm install, build, and test
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build --if-present
        npm run test --if-present
      working-directory: my-app-folder # set to the folder with your app if it is not the root directory
```

**Python**

```yaml
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**.NET**

```yaml
    - name: 'Run dotnet build'
      shell: bash
      run: |
        # If your web app project is not located in your repository's root
        # Please consider using pushd to change your path
        pushd .
        dotnet build --configuration Release --output ./output
        popd
```

**Java**

```yaml
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Set up JDK 1.8
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 1.8
    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml
```
## Deploy to App Service

To deploy your code to an App Service app, use the `azure/webapps-deploy@v2` action. This action has four parameters:

| **Parameter**  | **Explanation**  |
|---------|---------|
| **app-name** | (Required) Name of the App Service app | 
| **publish-profile** | (Optional) Publish profile file contents with Web Deploy secrets |
| **package** | (Optional) Path to package or folder. *.zip, *.war, *.jar or a folder to deploy |
| **slot-name** | (Optional) Enter an existing Slot other than the Production slot |

# [User-level credentials](#tab/userlevel)

Below is the sample workflow to build and deploy a Node.js app to Azure using an Azure service principal. Note how the `creds` input references the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret that you created earlier.
