# Create a static HTML web app in Azure

[Azure Web Apps](app-service-web-overview.md) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service.  This quickstart shows how to deploy a basic HTML+CSS site to Azure Web Apps. You'll complete this quickstart in [Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview), but you can also run these commands locally with [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

![Home page of sample app](media/app-service-web-get-started-html/hello-world-in-browser-az.png)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Install web app extension for Cloud Shell

To complete this quickstart, you will need to add the [az web app extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/extension?view=azure-cli-latest#az-extension-add). If the extension is already installed, you should update it to the latest version. To update the web app extension, type `az extension update -n webapp`.

To install the webapp extension, run the following command:

```bash
az extension add -n webapp
```

When the extension has been installed, the Cloud Shell shows information to the following example:

```bash
The installed extension 'webapp' is in preview.
```

## Download the sample

In the Cloud Shell, create a quickstart directory and then change to it.

```bash
mkdir quickstart

cd quickstart
```

Next, run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your quickstart directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
```

While running, it displays information similar to the following example:

```bash
Cloning into 'html-docs-hello-world'...
remote: Counting objects: 43, done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 43
Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
````

Change to the directory that contains the sample code and run the `az webapp up` command.

In the following example, replace <app_name> with a unique app name.

```bash
cd html-docs-hello-world

az webapp up -n <app_name>
```

This command may take a few minutes to run. While running, it displays information similar to the following example:

```json
Creating Resource group 'appsvc_rg_Windows_CentralUS' ...
Resource group creation complete
Creating App service plan 'appsvc_asp_Windows_CentralUS' ...
App service plan creation complete
Creating app '<app_name>' ....
Webapp creation complete
Creating zip with contents of dir /home/username/quickstart/html-docs-hello-world ...

All done.
{
  "app_url": "https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net",
  "location": "Central US",
  "name": "<app_name>",
  "os": "Windows",
  "resourcegroup": "appsvc_rg_Windows_CentralUS ",
  "serverfarm": "appsvc_asp_Windows_CentralUS",
  "sku": "FREE",
  "src_path": "/home/username/quickstart/html-docs-hello-world ",
  "version_detected": "-",
  "version_to_create": "-"
}
```

The `az webapp up` command does the following actions:

- Create a default resource group.

- Create a default app service plan.

- Create an app with the specified name.

- [Zip deploy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-deploy-zip) files from the current working directory to the web app.

## Browse to the app

In a browser, go to the Azure web app URL: `http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net`.

The page is running as an Azure App Service web app.

![Sample app home page](media/app-service-web-get-started-html/hello-world-in-browser-az.png)

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your first HTML app to App Service.

## Update and redeploy the app

In the Cloud Shell, type `nano index.html` to open the nano text editor, and make a small change to the markup. For example, change the H1 heading from "Azure App Service - Sample Static HTML Site" to just "Azure App Service".

![Nano index.html](media/app-service-web-get-started-html/nano-index-html.png)

Save your changes and exit nano. Use the command `^O` to save and `^X` to exit.

You'll now redeploy the app. Substitute `<app_name>` with your web app.

```bash
az webapp up -n <app_name>
```

Once deployment has completed, switch back to the browser window that opened in the **Browse to the app** step, and refresh the page.

## Manage your new Azure web app

Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> to manage the web app you created.

From the left menu, click **App Services**, and then click the name of your Azure web app.

![Portal navigation to Azure web app](./media/app-service-web-get-started-html/portal1.png)

You see your web app's Overview page. Here, you can perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete.

The left menu provides different pages for configuring your app.

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete the resource group by running the following command in the Cloud Shell:

```bash
az group delete --name appsvc_rg_Windows_CentralUS
```

This command may take a minute to run.
