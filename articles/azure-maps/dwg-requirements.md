# DWG package requirements

The Azure Maps Conversion API allows you to convert a DWG design package, for a single facility, into map data set. This article helps you understand the DWG package requirements for the Conversion API.

## Prerequisites

You may choose any CAD software to produce your DWG package.

You'll also need to acquaint yourself with the following terms before we explain the DWG package requirements.

| Term  | Definition |
|:-------|:------------|
| Layer | An AutoCAD DWG layer|
| Level | An area of a building at a set elevation. For example, the floor of a building |
| Xref  | A DWG file attached to the primary drawing as an external reference |
| Feature | An object that combines a geometry with an additional metadata information |
| Feature Classes | A common blueprint for features. For example, a Unit is a feature class and an office is a feature |

## Package structure

A DWG package consists of DWG files and a manifest file. The DWG files can be organized in any way inside the zip folder, but the manifest file must live at the root directory of the folder. The files in the package must define a single facility and be zipped in a single folder.  The next sections detail the requirements for the DWG files, manifest file, and the content of these files.

## DWG files requirements

A single DWG file is required for each level of the facility. And all data for a level must be contained in a single DWG file. Any external references (xrefs) must be bound to the parent drawing. Additionally, each DWG file:

* Must define the _Exterior_ and _Unit_ layers. It's recommended that each level also defines the following optional layers: _Wall_, _Door_, _UnitLable_, _Zone_, and _ZoneLabel_.
* Must not contain features from multiple levels
* Must not contain features from multiple facilities

The Azure Maps Conversion Service can extract the following feature classes from the DWG files:

* Levels
* Units
* Zones
* Openings
* Walls

A DWG layer must contain features of a single class. Classes can't share a layer. For example, units and walls can't share a layer.

Moreover:

* The origins of drawings for all DWG files, of a facility, must align to the same latitude and longitude.
* Each level must be in the same orientation
* Self-intersecting polygons will be repaired automatically. A warning will be raised, so the repair results can be inspected manually.
* All CAD entities must be one of the following types: Line, PolyLine, Polygon, Circular Arc, Circle, Text (single line). Any other entity types will be ignored.

The table below outlines the supported entity types for each layer. The layer ignores any mon-supported entity types.

| Layer | Supported entity types |
| :----- | :-------------------|
| Exterior | Polygon, PolyLine (closed) |
| Units |  Polygon, PolyLine (closed) |
| Walls  | Polygon, PolyLine (closed) |
| Doors | Polygon, PolyLine, Line, CircularArc, Circle |
| Zones | Polygon, PolyLine (closed) |
| UnitLabel | Text (single line) |
| ZoneLabel | Text (single line) |

The next sections detail the requirements for each layer.

### Exterior layer

The DWG file for each level must contain a layer to define that level's perimeter. This layer is referred  to as the exterior layer.

Regardless of how many entities you draw in the exterior layer, the [resulting facility data set](indoor-data-management.md#Data-sets) will contain only one level feature for each DWG file. Additionally, the exterior layer:

* Must contain at least one closed PolyLine, which defines the exterior perimeter of the building at that level
* Must not contain multiple PolyLines

If the layer contains multiple overlapping PolyLines, then the PolyLines will be dissolved into a single Level feature. Alternatively, if the layer contains multiple non_overlapping PolyLines, the resulting Level feature will have a multi-polygonal representation.

### Units layer

The DWG file for each level should define a layer containing units.  Units are navigable spaces in the building, such as offices and hallways. The Units layer should adhere to the following requirements:

* Units must be drawn as closed PolyLines
* Units must not partially overlap
* Units must not contain any self-intersecting geometry
* Units must fall inside the bounds of the facility exterior perimeter
* Units must not overlap

 Name a unit by creating a text object in the _unitLabel_ layer, then place the object inside the bounds of the unit. For more information, see the [UnitLabel layer](#UnitLabel-layer).

### Walls layer

The DWG file for each level may contain a layer that defines the physical extents of walls, columns, and other building structure.

* Walls must be drawn as closed PolyLines
* The wall layer(s) should only contain geometry that's interpreted as building structure

### Doors layer

A DWG layer containing doors may be included in the package. To create a DWG layer for doors, each door must overlap the edge of a unit from the unit layer.

Doors won't be rendered on the resulting map, as drawn in the CAD software. However, the doors will be drawn according to the Azure Maps styling rules for the opening features.

### Zones layer

The DWG file for each level may contain a zone layer that defines the physical extents of zones. A Zone layer:

* Must be drawn as closed PolyLines
* May overlap
* May fall inside or outside the facility's exterior perimeter

A zone can be named by creating a text object in the _zoneLabel_ layer and placing the text object inside the bounds of the zone. See the [ZoneLabel layer](#ZoneLabel-layer) for more details.

### UnitLabel layer

The DWG file for each level may contain a unit label layer. The unit label layer adds a name property to units extracted from the Unit layer. Units with a name property can have additional details specified in the manifest file.

* Unit labels must be single-line text entities.
* Unit labels must fall inside the bounds of their unit.
* Units must not contain multiple text entities in the unit labels layer.

### ZoneLabel layer

The DWG file for each level may contain a zone label layer. This layer adds a name property to zones extracted from the Zone layer. Zones with a name property can have additional details specified in the manifest file.

* Zones labels must be single-line text entities.
* Zones labels must fall inside the bounds of their zone.
* Zones must not contain multiple text entities in the zone labels layer.

## Manifest file requirements

The zip folder must contain a manifest file at the root level of the directory, and the file must be named **manifest.json**. As indicated by the name, the manifest file is a JSON text file. It defines DWG file names, georeferencing information, and facility details.

The DWG file names must match the layer names. The file paths, in the **building_levels** object of the manifest file, must be relative to the root of the zip file. Only the files identified by the manifest will be ingested by the Conversion API. Files that are in the zip folder, but aren't properly listed in the manifest, will be ignored.

Although there are requirements when using the manifest objects, not all objects are required. The table below shows the required and the optional objects for version 1.1 of the Conversion API.

## Next steps

Once your DWG package meets the outlined requirements, you may use the Conversion API to convert the DWG file to a map data set. Then, you can use the data set to generate an indoor map using the Indoor Maps module. Learn more about using the Indoor Maps module by reading the following articles:
