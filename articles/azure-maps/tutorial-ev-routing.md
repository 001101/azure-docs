# ELectric Vehicle Routing using Azure Notebooks (Python)

Azure Maps is a portfolio of geospatial service APIs natively integrated into Azure that enable developers, enterprises and ISVs to create location aware apps and IoT, mobility, logistics and asset tracking solutions.  Also, users can leverage our services to support their scenarios, for example, around data analysis and machine learning (ML).  In order to perform data analysis, users can call directly Azure Maps REST APIs and visualize Azure Maps data using Python. Azure Maps offers a robust set of [routing APIs]([https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows users to calculate routes between the desired set of points based on various conditions such as vehicle type or reachable area. In this tutorial, we will implement a scenario consisting of an electric vehicle with low charge and its driver who needs to find the closest possible charging station with respect to drive time.

In this tutorial you will:

    ![install packages](./media/tutorial-ev-routing/install-packages.png)

## Load required modules and frameworks

Run the following script to load all of the required modules and frameworks.

```python
import os
import json
import time
import aiohttp
import requests
from IPython.display import Image, display
```

## Request for reachable range boundary

In our scenario, package delivery company has some electric vehicles in their fleet. During the day electric vehicles need to be recharged without having to return to the warehouse. Every time the current charge goes below 45 kWH (electric vehicle is low on charge), we need to search for a set of charging stations that are within the reachable range and get the boundary information for that range. Because company prefers to use routes balanced by economy and speed, the requested routeType is 'eco'. The following script calls the [Get route range API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getrouterange) of the Azure Maps routing service with parameters for the vehicle's consumption model and parses the response to create a polygon object of the geojson format representing the car's maximum reachable range.

Run the script below to get bounds for the electric vehicle's reachable range.

```python
subscriptionKey = "[Your primary subscriptions key]"
currentLocation = "34.05220607655166,-118.24339270591734"
session = aiohttp.ClientSession()

routeRangeResponse = await (await session.get("https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/range/json?subscription-key={}&api-version=1.0&query={}&travelMode=car&vehicleEngineType=electric&energyBudgetInkWh=20&currentChargeInkWh=35&maxChargeInkWh=80&routeType=eco&constantSpeedConsumptionInkWhPerHundredkm=50,8.2:130,21.3".format(subscriptionKey,currentLocation))).json()

polyBounds = routeRangeResponse["reachableRange"]["boundary"]

for i in range(len(polyBounds)):
    coordList = list(polyBounds[i].values())
    coordList[0], coordList[1] = coordList[1], coordList[0]
    polyBounds[i] = coordList

polyBounds.pop()
polyBounds.append(polyBounds[0])

boundsData = {
               "geometry": {
                 "type": "Polygon",
                 "coordinates": 
                   [
                      polyBounds
                   ]
                }
             }
```

## Search electric vehicle charging stations within reachable range

Once we have the reachable range (isochrone) for the electric vehicle,  we can search for charging stations in that range. The following script calls the Azure Maps [Post Search Inside Geometry API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/postsearchinsidegeometry) to search for electric vehicle charging stations within bounds of the car's maximum reachable range, and then parses the response to an array of reachable locations.

Run the following script to search for electric vehicle charging stations within reachable range.

```python
searchPolyResponse = await (await session.post(url = "https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/geometry/json?subscription-key={}&api-version=1.0&query=electric vehicle station".format(subscriptionKey), json = boundsData)).json() 

reachableLocations = []
for loc in range(len(searchPolyResponse["results"])):
                location = list(searchPolyResponse["results"][loc]["position"].values())
                location[0], location[1] = location[1], location[0]
                reachableLocations.append(location)

```

## Upload reachable range and charging points to Azure Maps Data service

In order to visualize the charging stations and boundary for the maximum reachable range of the electric vehicle on the map, we need to upload the boundary data and charging stations data as geojson objects to the Azure Maps Data service, using the [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadpreview). 

Run the following two cells to upload the boundary and charging point data to the Azure Maps data service.

```python
rangeData = {
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {},
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          polyBounds
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

uploadRangeResponse = await session.post("https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/upload?subscription-key={}&api-version=1.0&dataFormat=geojson".format(subscriptionKey), json = rangeData)

rangeUdidRequest = uploadRangeResponse.headers["Location"]+"&subscription-key={}".format(subscriptionKey)
# getRangeUdid = await (await session.get(rangeUdidRequest)).json()

while True:
    getRangeUdid = await (await session.get(rangeUdidRequest)).json()
    if 'udid' in getRangeUdid:
        break
    else:
        time.sleep(0.2)
rangeUdid = getRangeUdid["udid"]
```

```python
poiData = {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
      {
        "type": "Feature",
        "properties": {},
        "geometry": {
            "type": "MultiPoint",
            "coordinates": reachableLocations
        }
    }
  ]
}

uploadPOIsResponse = await session.post("https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/upload?subscription-key={}&api-version=1.0&dataFormat=geojson".format(subscriptionKey), json = poiData)
poiUdidRequest = uploadPOIsResponse.headers["Location"]+"&subscription-key={}".format(subscriptionKey)

while True:
    getPoiUdid = await (await session.get(poiUdidRequest)).json()
    if 'udid' in getPoiUdid:
        break
    else:
        time.sleep(0.2)

poiUdid = getPoiUdid["udid"]
```

## Render charging stations and reachable range on map

Once we have the data uploaded to the data service, we will now run the following script to call the Azure Maps Get Map Image service, [Get Map Image API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/render/getmapimage) to render the charging points and maximum reachable boundary on the static map image. 

```python
path = "lc1773c6|fcdcbdba|lw3|la0.80|fa0.40||udid-{}".format(rangeUdid)
pins = "default|la-35+50|ls12|lc003C62|co197cd9||udid-{}".format(poiUdid)

staticMapResponse =  await session.get("https://atlas.microsoft.com/map/static/png?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={}&pins={}&path={}&center=-118.36669921875,34.17318076114497&zoom=7".format(subscriptionKey,pins,path))
poiRangeMap = await staticMapResponse.content.read()


display(Image(poiRangeMap))
```

![location range](./media/tutorial-ev-routing/location-range.png)


## Find the optimal charging station to stop

After we have all the potential charging stations within the reachable range, we want to know which one of the stations can be reached in the minimum amount of time. The following script calls the Azure Maps [Matrix routing API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/postroutematrixpreview) returning for the given vehicle location the travel time and distance to every given charging station location. Next the script parses the response to get location for the closest reachable charging station with respect to time.

Run the following script to find the closest reachable charging station that can be reached in the minimum amount of time.

```python
locationData = {
            "origins": {
              "type": "MultiPoint",
              "coordinates": [[-122.1386142, 47.6422088]]
            },
            "destinations": {
              "type": "MultiPoint",
              "coordinates": reachableLocations
            }
         }

searchPolyRes = await session.post(url = "https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?subscription-key={}&api-version=1.0&waitForResults=false".format(subscriptionKey), json = locationData) 
routeMatrixResponse = await (await session.get(searchPolyRes.headers["Location"])).json()

distances = []
for dist in range(len(reachableLocations)):
    distances.append(routeMatrixResponse["matrix"][0][dist]["response"]["routeSummary"]["travelTimeInSeconds"])
    
minDistIndex = distances.index(min(distances))
reachableLocations[minDistIndex][0], reachableLocations[minDistIndex][1] = reachableLocations[minDistIndex][1], reachableLocations[minDistIndex][0]
closestChargeLoc = ",".join(str(i) for i in reachableLocations[minDistIndex])
```

## Calculate route to the closest charging station

After we have found the closest charging station, next we will call the [Get Route Directions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) to request the detailed route from the electric vehicle's current location to the charging station.

First, you need to run the following script to get the route, and parse the response to create a geojson object of the route.

```python
routeResponse = await (await session.get("https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/json?subscription-key={}&api-version=1.0&query={}:{}".format(subscriptionKey, currentLocation, closestChargeLoc))).json()

routeResponse
route = []
for loc in range(len(routeResponse["routes"][0]["legs"][0]["points"])):
                location = list(routeResponse["routes"][0]["legs"][0]["points"][loc].values())
                location[0], location[1] = location[1], location[0]
                route.append(location)

routeData = {
         "type": "LineString",
         "coordinates": route
     }
```

## Visualize the route

In order to visualize the route, we will first upload the route data as a geojson object into the Azure Maps Data service using the Azure Maps [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/uploadpreview). And then call the Render service, [Get Map Image API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/render/getmapimage) to render the route on the map and visualize it.

Run the following script to get the image for the rendered route on the map.

```python
routeUploadRequest = await session.post("https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/upload?subscription-key={}&api-version=1.0&dataFormat=geojson".format(subscriptionKey), json = routeData)

udidRequestURI = routeUploadRequest.headers["Location"]+"&subscription-key={}".format(subscriptionKey)

while True:
    udidRequest = await (await session.get(udidRequestURI)).json()
    if 'udid' in udidRequest:
        break
    else:
        time.sleep(0.2)

udid = udidRequest["udid"]

origin = currentLocation.split(",")
destination = closestChargeLoc.split(",")

path = "lc0f6dd9|lw5||udid-{}".format(udid)
pins = "default|la-35+50|ls12|codb1818||{} {}|{} {}".format(origin[1],origin[0],destination[1],destination[0])

staticMapResponse = await session.get("https://atlas.microsoft.com/map/static/png?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={}&&path={}&pins={}&center=-118.34609985351562,34.04469442222683&zoom=10".format(subscriptionKey,path,pins))
staticMapImage = await staticMapResponse.content.read()

await session.close()

display(Image(staticMapImage))
```
