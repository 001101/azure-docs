# Using the Azure Maps DWG Error Visualizer

The [Azure Maps Conversion API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/conversion) lets you download a stand-alone web application to visualize [DWG package warnings and errors](dwg-conversion-error-codes.md). The web application has a static page that you can use without connecting to an internet network. It is a convenient visual tool to inspect warnings and errors in your DWG package that are detected by the Conversion API.  In order to successfully convert your DWG package into map data, it must meet the [DWG package requirements](dwg-requirements.md). For more information on the DWG conversion process see the [Private Atlas for indoor maps concept article](private-atlas-for-indoor-maps.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you can download the DWG Error Visualizer, you will need to:

1. [Obtain a primary subscription key](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account) by [making an Azure Maps account](quick-demo-map-app.md#create-an-account-with-azure-maps)

2. [Enable the Private Atlas resource](tutorial-private-atlas-indoor-maps.md) in your Azure Maps account

3. Upload your DWG package to the Azure Maps service, and obtain a `udid` for the uploaded package. This procedure is detailed in the [DWG Uploading section of the Private Atlas](private-atlas-for-indoor-maps.md#upload-a-dwg-package#uploading-a-dwg-package) concept article.

## Download

Now that you have the `udid` for the uploaded package, make a request to the Azure Maps Conversion API. The procedure is detailed in the [DWG Uploading section of the Private Atlas](private-atlas-for-indoor-maps.md#upload-a-dwg-package#uploading-a-dwg-package) concept article.

Under the response **Headers** tab, look for the `diagnosticPackageLocation` property, returned by [Azure Maps Conversion API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/conversion). The DWG Error Visualizer can be downloaded by executing a `HTTP-GET` request on the `diagnosticPackageLocation`. See [Azure Maps Conversion API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/conversion) for more details on how to to download.

## Setup

Inside the downloaded zipped package from the `diagnosticPackageLocation` link, you'll find two files. The _ConversionWarningsAndErrors.json_ containing a formatted list of warnings, errors, and additional details that is used by the _VisualizationTool.zip_. The _VisualizationTool.zip_ is the standalone web application for DWG Error Visualizer.

Unzip the _VisualizationTool.zip_ folder. It contains an _assets_ folder with images and media files, a _static_ folder with source code, and an index.html file of the web page.

Open the _index.html_ file using any of the browsers below, with the respective version number. You may use a different version, if the version offers equally compatible behavior as the listed version.

- Microsoft Edge 80
- Safari 13
- Chrome 80
- Firefox 74

## Using the DWG Error Visualizer tool

Upon launching the DWG Error Visualizer tool, you'll see a box to load your data, as shown in the image below. To view the warnings and errors, load the _ConversionWarningsAndErrors.json_ file, placed at the root of the downloaded directory.

    ![DWG Error Visualizer App - Start Page](./media/azure-maps-dwg-errors-visualizer/start-page.png)

Once the file loads, you'll see a list of your DWG package errors and warnings. Specified by the layer, level, and described with a detailed message. You may now navigate to each error to learn more details in order to resolve the error.

## Next steps

Once your [DWG package meets the requirements](dwg-requirements.md), you may use the [Azure Maps Conversion API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/conversion) to convert the DWG file to a map data set. Then, you can use the Indoor Maps web module to develop your application. Learn more  by reading the following articles:
