# What is Azure Maps?
Azure Maps is a collection of REST APIs for geospatial services such as Maps, Search, Routing, Traffic, and Time Zones. You may use these APIs with familiar tools to quickly develop and scale solutions that integrate location information into your Azure solutions. Azure Maps is backed by fresh mapping data so you can provide accurate geographic context to your web and mobile applications. Alongwith the REST APIs, it provides a web-based JavaScript control to make development easy, flexible, and portable across multiple mediums. 

The following video introduces Azure Maps:

## Geospatial services

Azure Maps consists of the following six primary services to bolster Azure applications with geographic context. 

1. The **Render service** is designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around mapping. The service uses either high-quality raster graphic images, available in 19 zoom levels, or fully customizable vector format map images.

The Render service now includes **Imagery** APIs that allows developers to get a vector tile with satellite imagery.

2. The **Route service** contains robust real-world infrastructure geometry calculations and multiple transportation mode directions. The service allows for developers to calculate directions across a number of travel modes such as car, truck, bicycle, or walking. The service can also consider inputs such as traffic conditions, weight restrictions, or hazardous material transport.

The Route service now provides APIs for:
    1. **Batch routing** which processes a set of route requests in one call, for a simpler application that needs to process multiple routes, and
    2. **Matrix routing**, which returns a matrix of route summaries for a set of origin and destination locations.
    3. **Reachable range** calculation, which returns an area (as a polygon) that can be reached from an origin point, for a given fuel or time constraint. 

3. The **Search service** is designed for developers to search for addresses, places, business listings by name or category, and other geographic information. The Search Service can also [reverse geocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_geocoding) addresses and cross streets based on a latitude/longitude.

The Search service now provides APIs to:
    1. **Batch** search as well as reverse geocode a group of addresses. This allows for a simpler application that needs to process a large database of addresses.
    2. **Polygon search**, which returns a polygon for the area being searched. This will help in applications that need boundary data for a geographical area.

4. The **Time Zone service** allows you to query current, historical, and future time zone information using either latitude-longitude pairs or an [IANA ID](http://www.iana.org/). The Time Zone service also allows for converting Microsoft Windows time zone IDs to IANA time zones, fetching a time zone offset to UTC and getting the current time in a respective time zone. A typical JSON response for a query to the Time Zone Service looks like the following sample:

```JSON
{
    "Version": "2017c",
    "ReferenceUtcTimestamp": "2017-11-20T23:09:48.686173Z",
    "TimeZones": [{
        "Id": "America/Los_Angeles",
        "ReferenceTime": {
            "Tag": "PST",
            "StandardOffset": "-08:00:00",
            "DaylightSavings": "00:00:00",
            "WallTime": "2017-11-20T15:09:48.686173-08:00",
            "PosixTzValidYear": 2017,
            "PosixTz": "PST+8PDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0"
        }
    }]
}
```

5. The **Traffic service** is a suite of web services designed for developers to create web and mobile applications requiring traffic. The service provides two data types:
* Traffic flow - real-time observed speeds and travel times for all key roads in the network. 
* Traffic incidents - an accurate view about the traffic jams and incidents around the road network.

6. The **IP to Country** service allows you to retrieve the two letter country code for a given IP address. As a developer, you can use this service to alter the content of your application based on the geographic location. This service can help you tailor your application to meet special geopolitical constraints, as well as significantly enhance user experience based on the location. 


Azure Maps is built for mobility and can power cross-platform applications since the programming model is agnostic and supports JSON output through REST APIs. Additionally, Azure Maps offers a convenient JavaScript map control with a simple programming model for quick and easy development of both web and mobile applications. 

Azure Maps uses a key-based authentication scheme, so accessing the services is a matter of navigating to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com) and creating an Azure Maps account. Your account comes with two keys pre-generated for you. Start integrating these location capabilities directly into your applications by using either of your keys in the requests to the Azure Maps service.

## Unsupported regions
The Azure Maps API is currently unavailable in some countries. Check your current IP address and verify that your IP address' location is not in one of the unsupported countries below:

* Argentina
* China
* India
* Morocco
* Pakistan
* South Korea
