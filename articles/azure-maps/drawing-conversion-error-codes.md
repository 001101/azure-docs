# Drawing conversion errors and warnings

The [Azure Maps Conversion service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/conversion) lets you convert uploaded Drawing packages into map data. Drawing packages must adhere to the [Drawing package requirements](drawing-requirements.md). If one or more requirements are not met, then the Conversion service will return errors and/or warnings. This article lists the conversion error and warning codes, with recommendations on how to resolve them. It also provides some examples of drawings that can cause the Conversion service to return these codes.

The Conversion service will succeed if there are any conversion warnings, but itâ€™s recommended that you review and/or resolve all warnings. A warning means part of the conversion was ignored or automatically fixed. Failing to resolve the warnings could result in errors in latter processes.

## General Warnings

### **geometryWarning**

#### *Description for geometryWarning*

A **geometryWarning** occurs when the drawing contains an invalid entity. An invalid entity is an entity that does not conform to geometric constraints, such as a self-intersecting polygon or a non-closed PolyLine in a layer that only supports closed geometry.

The Conversion service is unable to create a map feature from an invalid entity and instead ignores it.

#### *Examples for geometryWarning*

* The two images below show examples of self-intersecting polygons.

     ![Example of a self-intersecting polygon](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/geometryWarning1.png)

     ![Example of a self-intersecting polygon](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/geometryWarning2.png)

* Below is an image that shows a non-closed PolyLine. Assume that the layer only supports closed geometry.

    ![Example of a non-closed PolyLine](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/geometryWarning3.png)

#### *How to fix geometryWarning*

Inspect the **geometryWarning** for each entity to verify that it follows geometric constraints.

### **unexpectedGeometryInLayer**

#### *Description for unexpectedGeometryInLayer*

An **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** warning occurs when the drawing contains geometry that is incompatible with the expected geometry type for a given layer. When the Conversion service returns an **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** warning, it will ignore that geometry.

#### *Example for unexpectedGeometryInLayer*

The image below shows a non-closed PolyLine. Assume that the layer only supports closed geometry.

![Example of a non-closed PolyLine](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/geometryWarning3.png)

#### *How to fix unexpectedGeometryInLayer*

Inspect each **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** warning and move the incompatible geometry to a compatible layer. If it is not compatible with any of the other layers, it should be removed.

### **unsupportedFeatureRepresentation**

#### *Description for unsupportedFeatureRepresentation*

The **unsupportedFeatureRepresentation** warning occurs when the drawing contains an unsupported entity type.

#### *Example for unsupportedFeatureRepresentation*

The image belows shows an unsupported entity type as a multi-line text object on a label layer.
  
![Example of a multi-line text object on label layer](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/multiLine.png)

#### *How to fix unsupportedFeatureRepresentation*

Ensure that your DWG files contain only the supported entity types listed under the [Drawing files requirements section in the Drawing package requirements article](drawing-requirements.md#drawing-package-requirements).

### **automaticRepairPerformed**

#### *Description for automaticRepairPerformed*

The **automaticRepairPerformed** warning occurs when the Conversion service automatically repairs invalid geometry.

#### *Examples for automaticRepairPerformed*

* The following image shows how the Conversion service repaired a self-intersecting polygon into valid geometry.

    ![Example of a self-intersecting polygon repaired](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/automaticRepair1.png)

* The image below shows how the Conversion service snapped the first and last vertex of a non-closed PolyLine to create a closed PolyLine, where the first and last vertex were less than 1 mm apart.  

    ![Example of a snapped PolyLine](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/automaticRepair2.png)

* The image below shows how, in a layer that supports only closed PolyLines, the Conversion service repaired multiple non-closed PolyLines by combining them into a single closed PolyLine. This fix was done to avoid discarding the PolyLines.

    ![Example of non-closed Polylines combined into a single closed PolyLine](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/automaticRepair3.png)

#### *How to fix automaticRepairPerformed*

To fix an **automaticRepairPerformed** warning, do the following:

1. Inspect each warning's geometry and the specific warning text.
2. Determine if the automated repair is correct.
3. If the repair is correct, continue. Otherwise, go to the design file and resolve the warning manually.

>[!TIP]
>To suppress a warning in the future, make changes to the original drawing such that the original drawing matches the repaired drawing.

## Manifest warnings

### **redundantAttribution**

#### *Description for redundantAttribution*

The **redundantAttribution** warning occurs when the manifest contains redundant or conflicting object properties.

#### *Examples for redundantAttribution*

* The JSON snippet below contains two or more `unitProperties` objects with the same `name`.

    ```json

        {
            "unitName": "L1-100",
            "categoryName": "room.office"
        },
        {
            "unitName": "L1-101",
            "categoryName": "room.office"
        },
        {
            "unitName": "L1-101",
            "categoryName": "room.office"
        }
    ]
    ```

* In the JSON snippet below, two or more `zoneProperties` objects have the same `name`.

    ```json
     "zoneProperties": [
        {
            "zoneName": "Assembly Area 1",
            "categoryName": "zone.assembly"
        },
        {
            "zoneName": "Assembly Area 2",
            "categoryName": "zone.assembly"
        },

            "zoneName": "Assembly Area 2",
            "categoryName": "zone.assembly"
        }
    ```

#### *How to fix redundantAttribution*

To fix a **redundantAttribution* warning, remove redundant or conflicting object properties.

### **manifestWarning**

#### *Description for manifestWarning*

A **manifestWarning** occurs when the manifest contains unitProperties or zoneProperties objects that are unused during conversion.

#### *Examples for manifestWarning*

* The manifest contains a `unitProperties` object with a `unitName` that has no matching label in a `unitLabel` layer.

* The manifest contains a `zoneProperties` object with a `zoneName` that has no matching label in a `zoneLabel` layer.

#### *How to fix manifestWarning*

To fix a **manifestWarning**, remove the unused `unitProperties` or `zoneProperties` object from the manifest, or add a unit/zone label to the drawing so that the properties object is used during conversion.

## Wall warnings

### **wallOutsideLevel**

#### *Description for wallOutsideLevel*

The **wallOutsideLevel** warning occurs when the drawing contains a Wall geometry outside the bounds of a level outline.

#### *Example for wallOutsideLevel*

A **missingRequiredField** error occurs when the _manifest.json_ file is missing required data.

#### *How to fix missingRequiredField*

To fix a **missingRequiredField** error, verify that the manifest contains all required properties. For a full list of required manifest object, see the [manifest section in the Drawing package requirements](drawing-requirements.md#manifest-file-requirements)  

### **missingManifest**

#### *Description for missingManifest*

The **missingManifest** error occurs when the _manifest.json_ file is missing from the ZIP archive.

The **missingManifest** error occurs because of one or more of the following reasons:

* The _manifest.json_ file is misspelled.
* The _manifest.json_ is missing.
* The _manifest.json_ is not inside the root directory of the ZIP archive.

#### *How to fix missingManifest*

To fix a **missingManifest** error, confirm that the archive has a file named _manifest.json_ at the root level of the ZIP archive.

### **conflict**

#### *Description for conflict*

The **conflict** error occurs when the _manifest.json_ file contains conflicting information.

#### *Example scenario for conflict*

The Conversion service will return a **conflict** error  when more than one level is defined with the same level ordinal. The following JSON snippet shows two levels defined with the same ordinal.

```JSON
"buildingLevels":
{
    "levels": [
        {
            "levelName": "Ground",
            "ordinal": 0,
            "filename": "./Level_0.dwg"
        },
        {
            "levelName": "Parking",
            "ordinal": 0,
            "filename": "./Level_P.dwg"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### *How to fix conflict*

To fix a **conflict** error, inspect your _manifest.json_ and remove any conflicting information.

### **invalidGeoreference**

The **invalidGeoreference** error occurs when a _manifest.json_ file contains an invalid georeference.

The **invalidGeoreference** error occurs because of one or more of the following reasons:

* The user is georeferencing a latitude or longitude value that is out of range.
* The user is georeferencing a rotation value that is out of range.

#### *Example scenario for invalidGeoreference*

In the JSON snippet below, the latitude is above the upper limit.

```json
"georeference"
{
    "lat": 88.0,
    "lon": -122.132600,
    "angle": 0
},
```

#### *How to fix invalidGeoreference*

To fix an **invalidGeoreference** error, verify that the georeferenced values are within range.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In GeoJSON, the coordinates order is longitude and latitude. If you don't use the correct order, you may accidentally refer a latitude or longitude value that is out of range.

## Wall errors

### **wallError**

#### *Description for wallError*

The **wallError** occurs when the drawing contains an error while attempting to create a wall feature.

#### *Example scenario for wallError*
