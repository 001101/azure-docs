# Drawing conversion errors and warnings

The [Azure Maps Conversion service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/conversion) lets you convert uploaded Drawing packages into map data. Drawing packages must adhere to the [Drawing package requirements](drawing-requirements.md). If one or more requirements are not met, then the Conversion service will return errors and/or warnings. This article lists the conversion error and warning codes, with recommendations on how to resolve them. It also provides some examples of drawings that can cause the Conversion service to return these codes.

The Conversion service will succeed if there are any conversion warnings, but itâ€™s recommended that you review and/or resolve all warnings. A warning means part of the conversion was ignored or automatically fixed. Failing to resolve the warnings could result in errors in latter processes.

## General Warnings

### **geometryWarning**

#### *Description for geometryWarning*

A **geometryWarning** warning occurs when the Conversion service discovers an invalid entity. An invalid entity is an entity that does not conform to geometric constraints. The Conversion service is unable to create a map feature from an invalid entity and instead ignores it.

The following are examples of invalid entities:

* PolyLine features not meeting perfectly at a point.
* A self-intersecting polygon.
* An unclosed polygon.
* Gaps between polygon borders.
* Overlapping polygon borders.

#### *Example for geometryWarning*

 ![Example of a geometric error](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### *How to fix geometryWarning*

Inspect the **geometryWarning** warning for each entity to verify that it follows geometric constraints.

### **unexpectedGeometryInLayer**

#### *Description for unexpectedGeometryInLayer*

The **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** warning occurs when the Conversion service finds a geometry that is incompatible with its current layer. When the Conversion service throws an **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** warning, it will ignore that geometry.

#### *Examples for unexpectedGeometryInLayer*

* The Conversion service finds a non-closed PolyLine in the level outline layer, unit layer, zone layer, or wall layer.

    ![Example of a non-closed Polyline](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* The Conversion service finds a non-text entity in the zoneLabel layer or the unitLabel layer.

    ![Example of a non-text entity](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### *How to fix unexpectedGeometryInLayer*

Inspect each **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** warning and move the incompatible geometry to a compatible layer. If it is not compatible with any of the other layers, it should be removed.

### **unsupportedFeatureRepresentation**

#### *Description for unsupportedFeatureRepresentation*

The **unsupportedFeatureRepresentation** warning occurs when the Conversion service finds an unsupported entity type.

#### *Examples for unsupportedFeatureRepresentation*

* The Conversion service finds a multi-line text object on a label layer.
  
    ![Example of a multi-line text object on label layer](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* The Conversion service finds a 3D Face in the unit layer.

    ![Example of a 3D Face on unit layer](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* The Conversion service finds an old-style Polyline2D entity that hasn't been converted to a regular Polyline.

    ![Example of a Polyline2D entity](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### *How to fix unsupportedFeatureRepresentation*

Ensure that your DWG files contain only the supported entity types listed under the [Drawing files requirements section in the Drawing package requirements article](drawing-requirements.md#drawing-package-requirements).

### **automaticRepairPerformed**

#### *Description for automaticRepairPerformed*

The **automaticRepairPerformed** warning occurs when the Conversion service finds invalid geometry and automatically repairs it.

#### *Examples for automaticRepairPerformed*

* The Conversion service found and repaired a self-intersecting polygon.

    ![Example of a self-intersecting polygon repaired](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* The Conversion service found and repaired a non-closed Polyline with first and last vertices closer than 1 mm were snapped to make a closed Polyline.

    ![Example of a snapped Polyline](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* In a layer that only supports closed Polylines, the Conversion service found, and repaired multiple non-closed Polylines to to combine them into a single closed Polyline. This fix was done to avoid discarding the Polylines.

    ![Example of non-closed Polylines converted to closed Polyline](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### *How to fix automaticRepairPerformed*

To fix an **automaticRepairPerformed** warning, do the following:

1. Inspect each warning's geometry and the specific warning text.
2. Determine if the automated repair is correct.
3. If the repair is correct, continue. Otherwise, go to the design file and resolve the warning manually.

>[!TIP]
>To suppress a warning in the future, make changes to the original drawing such that the original drawing matches the repaired drawing.

## Manifest warnings
