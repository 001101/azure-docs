# Drawing conversion errors and warnings

The [Azure Maps Conversion service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/conversion) lets you convert uploaded Drawing packages into map data. Drawing packages must adhere to the [Drawing package requirements](drawing-requirements.md). If one or more requirements are not met, then the Conversion service will return errors and/or warnings. This article lists the conversion error and warning codes, with recommendations on how to resolve them. It also provides some examples of drawings that can cause the Conversion service to return these codes.

The Conversion service will succeed if there are any conversion warnings, but itâ€™s recommended that you review and/or resolve all warnings. A warning means part of the conversion was ignored or automatically fixed. Failing to resolve the warnings could result in errors in latter processes.

## General Warnings

### geometryWarning

#### Description for geometryWarning

The **geometryWarning** occurs when a geometric constraint is not being met by an entity in a DWG file. As a result, the Conversion service is unable to create a map feature from that entity.

#### Example scenarios for geometryWarning

A DWG file contains geometric errors, such as PolyLine features not meeting perfectly at a point, a self-intersecting polygon, unclosed polygon, gaps between polygon borders, or overlapping polygon borders.

 ![Example of a geometric error](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### How to fix geometryWarning

Inspect each **geometryWarning** warning for each entity to verify that it follows geometric constraints.

### unexpectedGeometryInLayer

#### Description for unexpectedGeometryInLayer

The **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** occurs when the Conversion service finds a geometry that is incompatible with its current layer. When the Conversion service throws an **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** warning, it will simply ignore that geometry.

#### Example scenarios for unexpectedGeometryInLayer

* A non-closed PolyLine is found in the level outline layer, unit layer, zone layer, or wall layer.

    ![Example of a non-closed Polyline](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* A non-text entity is found in the zoneLabel layer or the unitLabel layer.

    ![Example of a non-text entity](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### How to fix unexpectedGeometryInLayer

Inspect each **unexpectedGeometryInLayer** warning and move the geometry of unexpected type to a compatible layer. If it is not compatible with any of the other layers, it should be removed.

### unsupportedFeatureRepresentation

#### Description for unsupportedFeatureRepresentation

The **unsupportedFeatureRepresentation** warning occurs when the Conversion service finds an unsupported entity type.

#### Example scenarios for unsupportedFeatureRepresentation

* The Conversion service found a multi-line text object on a label layer.
  
    ![Example of a multi-line text object on label layer](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* The Conversion service found a 3D Face in the unit layer.

    ![Example of a 3D Face on unit layer](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* The Conversion service found an old-style Polyline2D entity that hasn't been converted to a regular Polyline.

    ![Example of a Polyline2D entity](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### How to fix unsupportedFeatureRepresentation

Ensure that your DWG files contain only the supported entity types listed under the [Drawing files requirements section in the Drawing package requirements article](drawing-requirements.md#drawing-package-requirements).

### automaticRepairPerformed

#### Description for automaticRepairPerformed

The **automaticRepairPerformed** warning occurs when invalid geometry, which would have otherwise caused an error, was automatically repaired.

#### Example scenarios for automaticRepairPerformed

* A self-intersecting polygon was repaired.

    ![Example of a self-intersecting polygon repaired](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* A non-closed Polyline with first and last vertices closer than 1 mm were snapped to make a closed Polyline.

    ![Example of a snapped Polyline](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* In a layer that only supports closed Polylines, multiple non-closed Polylines were combined to create a single closed Polyline. This fix was done to avoid discarding the Polylines.

    ![Example of non-closed Polylines converted to closed Polyline](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### How to fix automaticRepairPerformed

To fix an `automaticRepairPerformed` warning, do the following:

1. Inspect each warning's geometry and the specific warning text.
2. Determine if the automated repair is correct.
3. If the repair is correct, continue. Otherwise, go to the design file and resolve the warning manually.

>[!TIP]
>To suppress a warning in the future, make changes to the original drawing such that the original drawing matches the repaired drawing.

## Manifest warnings

### redundantAttribution

#### Description for redundantAttribution

The **redundantAttribution** warning occurs when the Conversion service finds redundant or conflicting object properties.

#### Example scenarios for redundantAttribution

* Two or more `unitProperties` objects with the same `name`.

    ![Example of unitProperty objects with same name](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

* Two or more `zoneProperties` objects with the same `name`.
    ![Example of zoneProperty objects with same name](./media/drawing-conversion-error-codes/placeholder.png)

#### How to fix redundantAttribution

To fix a **redundantAttribution* warning, remove redundant or conflicting object properties.

## Level warnings
