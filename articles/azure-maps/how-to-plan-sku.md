# How to choose the right tier for your Azure Maps account

Azure Maps allows you to create an account in two different tiers - **Premium** and **Standard**, depending on the features and bandwidth you will need for your scenario. This article helps you decide which tier is right for you. 

If you're just starting out with Azure Maps, make sure to go through the article [Launch an interactive search map using Azure Maps](quick-demo-map-app) for a quick guidance on account setup and usage. For pricing information, read [Azure Maps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-maps/). 

## Premium Vs Standard tier
The Azure Maps Premium tier is an enterprise-ready tier, which includes all features of the Standard tier, in addition to **decreased throttling**. The Standard tier throttles customer transactions at 50 requests per second. Premium tier lifts this throttling to service large-scale enterprise customers on the order of multiple thousand requests per second. 

The Standard tier is sufficient for customers who are small to mid-sized enterprises and/or who do not expect high volumes of concurrent users. This tier is generally available, which means it is applicable for all stages of production, from proof of concept and early stage testing to application production and deployment. 

In contrast, customers who need support for large-scale enterprise, mission-critical applications, high volumes of concurrent users or required advanced geospatial services can try out the new Premium tier. Note that this tier is currently in public preview, so it will not be yet available for production environments.

[!IMPORTANT] To use Premium tier services, you will need to create an additional Azure Maps Premium account. The Standard account cannot be upgraded to Premium.
