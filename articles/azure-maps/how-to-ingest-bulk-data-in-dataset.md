# Bulk import data into a dataset

This guide will show you how to use the [Dataset Import API]() to bulk import data into a data set. You don't need to know how to upload fixture data, we'll show you how to do that process as well.

## Prerequisites

First, you need to [obtain a primary subscription key](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account) by [making an Azure Maps account](quick-demo-map-app.md#create-an-account-with-azure-maps).

In this article, the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) application is used to call the Azure Maps APIs, but you may use any API development environment.

We assume that the bulk data you want to import into your existing data set is in GeoJSON format. If it's not, then use the [Azure Maps Conversion]() service to convert your bulk data into GeoJSON.

## Creating an initial data set

The instructions below overview the process of uploading a DWG package, converting the package, and creating a data set from the package. If you already have a data set to import the bulk data into, then skip this section and continue to the next section.

1. Before you upload data into the Azure Maps resources, make sure that your DWG package meets the [DWG package requirements](dwg-requirements.md).

2. Upload your DWG package to the Azure Maps service, and obtain a `udid` for the uploaded package. This procedure is detailed in the [Data Upload section of the Indoor Data Management](indoor-data-management.md#data-upload-procedure) article.

3. Once you obtain the `udid` for the uploaded packaged, convert the uploaded packaged using the Azure Maps Conversion service, and obtain the conversion `conversionId` for the converted package. This procedure is detailed in the [Data Conversion section of the Indoor Data Management](indoor-data-management.md#data-conversion-procedure) article.

4. Once you obtain the `conversionId` for the converted package, create an initial data set using the Azure Maps Dataset service, and obtain the `datasetId`. This procedure is detailed in the [Data sets section of the Indoor Data Management](indoor-data-management.md#data-sets) article. Copy the `datasetId`to use in the next section.

## Bulk import data into a dataset

This section assumes that you already have a data set, and that you know your `datasetId`. The steps below show you how to upload bulk data to Azure services, and then import the bulk data into an existing data set.

1. Prepare your bulk data by placing your GeoJSON files in a zip folder.

2. Open the Postman app. Near the top of the Postman app, select **New**. In the **Create New** window, select **Collection**. Name the collection and select the **Create** button.

3. To create the request, select **New** again. In the **Create New** window, select **Request**. Enter a **Request name** for the request. Select the collection you created in the previous step, and then select **save**.

4. Upload your zip folder using the Data Upload API. Select the **POST** HTTP method in the builder tab and enter the following URL. In the **Headers** tab, specify the `Content-Type` key value to `application/octet-stream` because we're uploading a zipped folder.

    ```http
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/upload?api-version=1.0&dataFormat=zip&subscription-key=<Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key>
    ```

5. In the **Body** tab, select **binary**. Click on **Select File** and choose the zip folder that contains your bulk data. When you're done, select the blue **Send** button.

    </center>

6. Upon a successful post request, the response **Headers** tab will contain a **Location** key with a URL. Make a **GET** request at this URL to obtain the `udid` for the successfully uploaded data. Remember to append your Azure Maps key for authentication.

7. If the upload failed, the response body will contain a message with details. If the upload was successful, then the response body will contain the `resourceLocation` element. The upload `udid` is in the URL of the `resourceLocation` element, as seen in the image below. Copy the `udid` for the upload data.

8. Call the [Dataset Import API]() to import bulk data from the zip folder resource to the dataset resource. You'll need the `datasetId` and the `udid` for the uploaded zip folder. Use the `type` parameter key with the `fixture` value. The **PATCH** request URL should look similar to the one below.

    ```http
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/dataset/import/<datasetId>?api-version=1.0&subscription-key=<Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key>&udid=<upload-udid>&type=fixture
    ```

9. After making the **PATCH** request call, you'll receive a response header containing the status URL. You can use this URL to query the status of the import request.

10. To query the status URL, append you Azure Maps subscription key, and make a **GET** request.

11. The response body will contain a status indicating if your data bulk import failed or succeeded. If the request failed, you'll see a message with the error details. Remember to append your Azure Maps key for authentication. If the bulk import operation failed, you'll see a message with details. For example, the operation fails if your data isn't in the right format. If the bulk import was successful, you'll see a success message, like in the below image.
