# Bulk import data into a dataset

This guide will show you how to use the [Dataset Import API]() to bulk import data into a dataset. It will also show you how to upload the data that you want to be imported to an existing data set.

## Prerequisites

You need to [obtain a primary subscription key](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account) by [making an Azure Maps account](quick-demo-map-app.md#create-an-account-with-azure-maps).

In this article, the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) application is used to call the Azure Maps APIs, but you may use any API development environment.

## Creating an initial data set

The instructions below start with the overview the process of uploading, converting a DWG package, and creating a data set. If you already have a data set to import the bulk data into, then skip this section and continue to the next section.

1. Before you upload data into the Azure Maps resources, make sure that your DWG package meets to the [DWG package requirements](dwg-requirements.md).

2. Upload your DWG package to the Azure Maps service, and obtain a `udid` of the uploaded package. This procedure is detailed in the [Data Upload section of the Indoor Data Management](indoor-data-management.md#data-upload-process) article.

3. Once you obtain the uploaded packaged `udid`, convert the uploaded packaged using the conversion service, and obtain the conversion `udid` of the converted package. This ID may also be called the conversion ID. The details are in the [Data Conversion section of the Indoor Data Management](indoor-data-management.md#data-conversion-process) article.

4. Create an initial data set, and obtain the data set ID, also known as the data set `udid`. For details on how to do this step, see the [Data sets section of the Indoor Data Management](indoor-data-management.md#data-sets) article. Copy the data set ID to use in the next section.

## Bulk import data into a dataset

This section assumes that you already have a data set. It shows you how to upload bulk data to Azure services, and then import the bulk data into an existing data set.

1. Prepare your bulk data by placing your GeoJSON files in a zip folder.

2. Open the Postman app. Near the top of the Postman app, select **New**. In the **Create New** window, select **Collection**. Name the collection and select the **Create** button.

3. To create the request, select **New** again. In the **Create New** window, select **Request**. Enter a **Request name** for the request. Select the collection you created in the previous step, and then select **save**.

4. Upload your zip folder using the Data Upload API. Select the **POST** HTTP method in the builder tab and enter the URL below. In the **Headers** tab, specify a value for the `Content-Type` key to be `application/vnd.geo+json`

    ```http
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/upload?api-version=1.0&dataFormat=zip&subscription-key=<Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key>
    ```

5. In the **Body** tab, select **binary**. Click on **Select File** and choose the zip folder that contains your bulk data. When you're done, select the blue **Send** button.

    </center>

6. Upon a successful post request, the response **Headers** tab will contain a **Location** key with a URL. Make a **GET** request at this URL to obtain the zip folder ID, also known as the upload `udid`. The code block below shows the expected format for this URL, and remember to append your Azure Maps key for authentication.

    ```http
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/<unique-alphanumeric-value>/status?api-version=1.0&subscription-key=<Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key>
    ```

7. If the get request was successful, the response body will contain the `resourceLocation` element. The upload `udid` is in the URL of the `resourceLocation` element, as seen in the image below. Copy the upload ID for this zip folder.

    </center>

8. Call the [Dataset Import API]() to import bulk data from the zip folder resource to the dataset resource. You'll need the data set ID and the zip folder upload ID, to import the zip folder data into the data set. For the `type` parameter, use the `fixture` value. The **PATCH** request URL should look similar to the one below.

    ```http
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/dataset/import/<datasetId>?api-version=1.0&subscription-key=<Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key>&udid=<upload-udid>&type=fixture
    ```

9. After making the **PATCH** request call, you'll receive a response header containing the status URL, highlighted in the image below. You can use this URL to query the status of the import request.

    <center>

    ![Upload data folder](./media/how-to-ingest-bulk-data-in-dataset/status-uri.png)

    </center>

10. To query the status URL, append you Azure Maps subscription key, and make a **GET** request. The response body lets you know, if your data bulk import failed or succeeded. If it failed, you'll see a message with more details.

    ```http
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/dataset/operations/<unique-alphanumeric-value>?api-version=1.0&subscription-key=TdexqUMLfpcl0Dl9mhBmmVe2g1fqTenJMl3qai-73KE
    ```
