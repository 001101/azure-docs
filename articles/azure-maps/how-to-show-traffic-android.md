# Show traffic incidents on the map using Azure Maps Android SDK

This guide shows you how to display traffic data. Flow data and incidents data are the two types of traffic data that can be displayed on the map. Incidents data consists of point and line-based data for things such as constructions, road closures, and accidents. Flow data shows metrics about the flow of traffic on the road.

## Incidents traffic data 

 The following code snippet shows how to display traffic data on the map. We pass a boolean value to the `incidents` method, and pass that to the `setTraffic` method. 

```java

    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        mapControl.getMapAsync(map - > {
            map.setTraffic(incidents(true));
    }
}
```

You will need to import the following libraries to call the `setTraffic` and `incidents` methods:

```javad
import static com.microsoft.com.azure.maps.mapcontrol.options.TrafficOptions.incidents;
```

## Flow traffic data

4. Use the following code snippet to set traffic flow data. Similar to the code in the previous section, we pass the return value of the `flow` method to the `setTraffic` method. There are four values that can be passed to `flow`, and each value would trigger `flow` to pass the respective return value. The return value of `flow` will then be passed as the argument to `setTraffic`. See the table below for these four values:

| | |
| :-- | :-- |
| TrafficFlow.NONE | Doesn't displays traffic data on the map |
| TrafficFlow.RELATIVE | Shows traffic data that's relative to the free-flow speed of the road |
| TrafficFlow.RELATIVE_DELAY | Displays areas that are slower than the average expected delay |
| TrafficFlow.ABSOLUTE | Shows the absolute speed of all vehicles on the road |

```java
public class TrafficFlowExampleActivity extends ExampleActivity {

    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        mapControl.getMapAsync(map -> 
            map.setTraffic(flow(TrafficFlow.RELATIVE)));
    }
}
```

You will need to import the following libraries to use the `setTraffic` and `flow` methods:

```java
import com.microsoft.azure.maps.mapcontrol.options.TrafficFlow;
import static com.microsoft.com.azure.maps.mapcontrol.options.TrafficOptions.flow;
```
