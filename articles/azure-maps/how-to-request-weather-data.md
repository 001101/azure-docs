# Request real-time and forecasted weather data using the Azure Maps Weather service

The Azure Maps [Weather service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather) is a set of RESTful APIs designed to help developers request both real-time and forecasted weather data.

In this article you'll learn, how to:

* Request real-time (current) weather data using the [Get Current Conditions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getcurrentconditionspreview).
* Request severe weather alerts using the [Get Severe Weather Alerts API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getsevereweatheralertspreview).
* Request daily forecasts using the [Get Daily Forecast API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getdailyforecastpreview).
* Request hourly forecasts using the [Get Hourly Forecast API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/gethourlyforecastpreview).
* Request minute by minute forecasts using the [Get Minute Forecast API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getminuteforecastpreview).

## Prerequisites

1. [Make an Azure Maps account](quick-demo-map-app.md#create-an-azure-maps-account)
2. [Obtain a primary subscription key](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account), also known as the primary key or the subscription key. For more information on authentication in Azure Maps, see [manage authentication in Azure Maps](./how-to-manage-authentication.md).

This tutorial uses the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) application, but you may choose a different API development environment.

## Request real-time weather forecast data

The [Get Current Conditions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getcurrentconditionspreview) returns detailed weather conditions such as precipitation, temperature, and wind for a given coordinate location. Also, observations from the past 6 or 24 hours for a particular location can be retrieved. The basic information returned with the response includes details like observation date and time, brief description of the weather conditions, weather icon, precipitation indicator flags, and temperature. RealFeel™ Temperature and UV index are also returned.

In this example, you'll use the [Get Current Conditions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getcurrentconditionspreview) to retrieve current weather conditions at coordinates located in Seattle, WA.

1. Open the Postman app. Near the top of the Postman app, select **New**. In the **Create New** window, select **Collection**.  Name the collection and select the **Create** button. You'll use this collection for the rest of the examples in this document.

2. To create the request, select **New** again. In the **Create New** window, select **Request**. Enter a **Request name** for the request. Select the collection you created in the previous step, and then select **Save**.

3. Select the **GET** HTTP method in the builder tab and enter the following URL. For this request, and other requests mentioned in this article, replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key.

    ```http
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/weather/currentConditions/json?api-version=1.0&query=47.60357,-122.32945&subscription-key={Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

4. Click the blue **Send** button. The response body contains current weather information.

## Request severe weather alerts

The [Get Severe Weather Alerts API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getsevereweatheralertspreview) returns worldwide severe weather alerts that are available from both official Government Meteorological Agencies and leading global to regional weather alert providers. The API returns details such as alert type, category, level, and detailed description about active severe alerts for the requested location. Severe alerts are issued for events like hurricanes, thunderstorms, lightning, heat waves, or forest fires.

In this example, you'll use the [Get Severe Weather Alerts API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getsevereweatheralertspreview) to retrieve current weather conditions at coordinates located in Cheyenne, WY.

>[!NOTE]
>This example retrieves severe weather alerts at the time of this writing. It is likely that there are no longer any severe weather alerts at the requested location. To retrieve actual severe alert data when running this example, you'll need to retrieve data at a different coordinate location.

1. Open the Postman app, click **New**, and select **Request**. Enter a **Request name** for the request. Select the collection you created in the previous section or created a new one, and then select **Save**.

2. Select the **GET** HTTP method in the builder tab and enter the following URL. For this request, and other requests mentioned in this article, replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key.

    ```http
    https://atlas.microsoft.com/weather/severe/alerts/json?api-version=1.0&query=41.161079,-104.805450&subscription-key={Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

3. Click the blue **Send** button. If there are no severe weather alerts, the response body will contain an empty `results[]` array. If there are severe weather alerts, the response body contains something like the following JSON response:

    ```json
    {
    "results": [
