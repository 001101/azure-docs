# How to provide feedback to Azure Maps

Azure Maps has generally been available since May 2018, providing fresh map data, easy-to-use REST APIs and powerful SDKs to support our enterprise customers on a variety of business use cases. The real world is changing every second and it’s crucial for us to provide a factual digital representation to our customers. Our customers that are planning to open or close facilities need to ensure our maps are updated promptly so that they can efficiently plan for delivery, maintenance or customer service at the right facilities. We have created the Azure Maps data feedback tool to empower our customers to provide direct data feedback. Customers’ data feedback goes directly to our data providers and their map editors who can quickly evaluate and incorporate feedback into our mapping products.  

Azure Maps Data Feedback provides an easy way for our customers to provide map data feedback, especially on business points of interest and residential addresses. Customers can provide data feedback by visiting https://feedback.azuremaps.com/. 

In this article we discuss various types of feedback that can be provided using the feedback site.

## Add a business place or residential address

Customers can interact with the map and add a missing point of interest or residential address by searching for a coordinate or dropping a pin at a specified map location. To do so open up the feed back site and search for the point of interests location or drop a pin at the location.
