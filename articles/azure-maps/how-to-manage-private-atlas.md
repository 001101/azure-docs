# Manage Private Atlas for your Azure Maps

Private Atlas (PA) makes it possible to create private indoor maps and develop web applications using the Azure Maps APIs and the Indoor Maps module. Private Atlas is currently available in the United States, only.

You can manage the Private Atlas for your Azure Maps account through the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/). After you deploy a Private Atlas, you can implement the Indoor Maps module and the Azure Maps APIs for the Private Atlas in your web application.

Your Azure Maps account must [use the S1 pricing tier](how-to-manage-pricing-tier.md) because Private Atlas isn't available for the S0 tier. You can't change your Azure Maps account to the S0 pricing tier while the Private Atlas is active. Delete your Private Atlas first, then you can switch to the S0 tier. For each Azure Maps account, you can have up to one Private Atlas.

Private Atlas inherits your Azure Maps Access Control (IAM) settings. Meaning that all your permission and roles apply to the Private Atlas. Also, your Private Atlas usage data is incorporated with your Azure Maps usage charts and activity log. The next sections show you how to create a Private Atlas, and how to delete it.

Before you begin, if you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). Once you make an Azure account, you need to [create an Azure Maps account](how-to-manage-account-keys.md) to access the Private Atlas resource.

## Create Private Atlas

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)

2. Select your Azure Maps account. If you can't see your Azure Maps account under the **Recent resources**, then navigate to the Azure portal menu. Select **All resources**, find, and select your Azure Maps account.

## Delete Private Atlas

You can delete the Private Atlas of your Azure Maps account using the Azure portal. By deleting it, you'll also delete the data sets, tile sets, and feature state sets created using the Private Atlas APIs.

Navigate to your Azure Maps account and select **Overview** under **Private Atlas**. If you have a Private Atlas for your Azure Maps account, then you'll see a **Delete** button.

Click the **Delete** button, and type your Private Atlas name to confirm your desire to delete it. Once the resource is erased, you'll see a confirmation page, like in the image below:
