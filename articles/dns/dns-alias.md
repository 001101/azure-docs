# Overview of Azure DNS alias records

Azure DNS alias records are a custom record type that allow you to reference other Azure resources from within your DNS zone for both forward and reverse lookups. For example, can create an alias record that references an Azure Public IP address instead of creating an A record. Since your alias record points to the service instance itself (an Azure Public IP address), then if the IP address were to change, you don't need to update the alias record in your zone. It points to the servcice instance, which has the actual IP address associated with it.

Other Azure services benefit from this Azure DNS integration too. For example, Azure Traffic Mangager uses CNAMEs to direct your traffic to the Traffic Manager profile. However, since you can't create a CNAME for a domain apex (for example, contoso.com) it was not possible to redirect direct contoso.comtraffic to Taffic Manager. You can use an alias record to solve this problem. For example, create
