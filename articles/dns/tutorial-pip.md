# Tutorial: Configure an alias record to refer to an Azure Public IP address 

You can create an alias record for your Public IP addresses. The alias record references an Azure Public IP address instance instead of an A record. Since your alias record points to the service instance (an Azure Public IP address), the alias record seamlessly updates itself during DNS resolution. It points to the service instance, which has the actual IP address associated with it.
