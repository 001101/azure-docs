# Live transcription (preview)

Azure Media Service delivers video, audio, and text in different protocols. When you publish your live stream using MPEG-DASH or HLS/CMAF, then along with video and audio, our service delivers the transcribed text in IMSC1.1 compatible TTML. The delivery is packaged into MPEG-4 Part 30 (ISO/IEC 14496-30) fragments. If using delivery via HLS/TS, then text is delivered as chunked VTT.

This article describes how to enable live transcription when streaming a Live Event with Azure Media Services v3. Before you continue, make sure you're familiar with the use of Media Services v3 REST APIs (see [this tutorial](stream-files-tutorial-with-rest.md) for details). You should also be familiar with the [live streaming](live-streaming-overview.md) concept. It's recommended to complete the [Stream live with Media Services](stream-live-tutorial-with-api.md) tutorial.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, live transcription is only available as a preview feature in the West US 2 region. It supports transcription of spoken words in English to text. The API reference for this feature is located below—becasuse it's in preview, the details aren't available with our REST documents.

## Live event regions and languages

Live transcription preview has expanded its availability to many more regions, here is the complete list:

- Southeast Asia
- West Europe
- North Europe
- East US

## Creating the Live Event

To create the Live Event, you send the PUT operation to the 2019-05-01-preview version, for example:

```
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/:subscriptionId/resourceGroups/:resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaServices/:accountName/liveEvents/:liveEventName?api-version=2019-05-01-preview&autoStart=true 
```

The operation has the following body (where a pass-through Live Event is created with RTMP as the ingest protocol). Note the addition of a transcriptions property.

```
{
  "properties": {
    "description": "Demonstrate how to enable live transcriptions",
    "input": {
      "streamingProtocol": "RTMP",
      "accessControl": {
        "ip": {
          "allow": [
            {
              "name": "Allow All",
              "address": "0.0.0.0",
              "subnetPrefixLength": 0
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "accessControl": {
        "ip": {

            {

              "address": "0.0.0.0",
              "subnetPrefixLength": 0
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "encoding": {
      "encodingType": "None"
    },
    "transcriptions": [
      {
        "language": "en-US"
      }
    ],
    "vanityUrl": false,
    "streamOptions": [
      "Default"
    ]
  },
  "location": "West US 2"
}
```

## Start transcription after live event has started

Customers now will be able to start and stop live transcription while the live event is in running state. To turn on live transcriptions or to update the transcription language, you will be updating the live event to include a “transcriptions” property. To turn off live transcriptions, the “transcriptions” property will be removed from the live event object.

To turn on live transcriptions, patch the live event to include the “transcriptions” property. To turn off live transcriptions, the “transcriptions” property will be removed from the live event object.

For more information about starting and stopping live events, read the Long-running operations section at [Develop with Media Services v3 APIs](media-services-apis-overview.md#long-running-operations)

> [!NOTE]
> Turning the transcription on or off more than once during the live event is not a supported scenario.

This is the sample call to turn on live transcriptions.

## Transcription delivery and playback

Review the [Dynamic packaging overview](dynamic-packaging-overview.md#to-prepare-your-source-files-for-delivery) article of how our service uses dynamic packaging to deliver video, audio, and text in different protocols. When you publish your live stream using MPEG-DASH or HLS/CMAF, then along with video and audio, our service delivers the transcribed text in IMSC1.1 compatible TTML. This delivery is packaged into MPEG-4 Part 30 (ISO/IEC 14496-30) fragments. If using delivery via HLS/TS, then the text is delivered as chunked VTT. You can use a web player such as the [Azure Media Player](use-azure-media-player.md) to play the stream.  

> [!NOTE]
> If using Azure Media Player, use version 2.3.3 or later.

## Known issues

For preview, the following are known issues with live transcription:

* The feature is available only in West US 2.
* Apps need to use the preview APIs, described in the [Media Services v3 OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/mediaservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.Media/preview/2019-05-01-preview/streamingservice.json).
* The only supported language is English (en-us).
* With content protection, only AES envelope encryption is supported.
