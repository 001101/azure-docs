## What is Azure Media Services?

> [!NOTE]
> The latest version of Azure Media Services (2018-03-30) is in preview. This version is also called v3.

Azure Media Services is an extensible cloud-based platform that enables application developers to build solutions that achieve broadcast-quality video streaming, enhance accessibility and distribution, analyze content, and much more. You do not need to be a media content creator to use Azure Media Services. You might be an expert in developing web or mobile apps but don’t have any experience working with and streaming videos, Media Services is for anybody who wants to deliver media experiences of outstanding quality to their viewers. Whether you are a call center, a government agency, an entertainment company, Media Services will help you to easily create media applications that can reach large audiences on today’s most popular mobile devices and browsers. 

If you want to see how easy it is to start streaming files, check out [Stream files](stream-files-dotnet-quickstart.md). 

If you want to first see more examples of what you can achieve with Azure Media Services, see [What can I do with Media Services?](#examples).  

### What is Media Services v3?

Media Services v3, is the latest version of the services and it is based on the Azure Resource Management framework. The latest version provides the following:

* It combines together the previously separate management and operations API into a single unified API surface. 
* It enhances Media Services capabilities by introducing a new templated workflow resource called a [Transform](transform-concept.md). Transforms help you define a workflow of tasks - essentially a recipe for processing your video and audio files. You can then apply it repeatedly to process all the files in your content library, by submitting jobs.
* Jobs can now be submitted using HTTP(s) URLs, SAS URLs, or paths to files located in Azure Blob storage. 
* Notifications have also been enhanced to integrate directly with the Azure Event Grid notification system. You can easily subscribe to events on several resources in Azure Media Services. For example, Job progress or states, or Live Channel start/stop and error events. 
* Customers can now use Resource Manager templates to create and deploy Transforms, Streaming Endpoints, Channels, and more.
* Role-based access control can also be set at the resource level, allowing customers to lock down access to specific resources like Transforms, Content Keys, Channels, and more.

## <a id="examples" />What can I do with Media Services?

The following are some examples of tasks you might want to achieve.  

* Deliver adaptive bitrate content in HLS, MPEG DASH, and Smooth Streaming formats so it can be played on a wide variety of browsers and devices.
  
    For both on-demand and live streaming delivery to various clients (mobile devices, TV, PC, etc.) the video and audio content needs to be encoded and packaged appropriately. To see how to deliver adaptive bitrate content, see [Quickstart: Encode and stream files](stream-files-dotnet-quickstart.md).
* Stream sport events, such as the Olympic Games, live. 
* Broadcast public government meetings and events such as town halls, City council meetings, and Legislative bodies (Parliament, House of Representatives).
* Analyze videos for call centers. Embedded in the audio data is a large amount of customer information that can be analyzed to achieve higher customer satisfaction. Organizations can extract text and build search indexes and dashboards. Then they can extract intelligence around common complaints, sources of complaints, and other relevant data.
* Analyze surveillance videos. Manually reviewing surveillance video is time intensive and prone to human error. You can utilize services such as motion detection and face detection to make the process of reviewing, managing, and creating derivatives easier.
* Stream a DRM protected content when a customer (for example, a movie studio) needs to restrict the use of proprietary copyrighted work.
* Deliver offline content for playback on airplanes, trains, and automobiles. A customer might need to download content onto their phone or tablet for playback when they anticipate to be disconnected from the network.
* Add subtitles and captions to videos to cater to a broader audience (for example, people with hearing disabilities or people who want to read along in a different language). 
* Implement an educational e-learning video platform with Azure Media Services and [Azure Cognitive Services APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#pivot=products&panel=ai) for speech-to-text captioning, translating to multi-languages, etc.
* Enable Azure CDN to achieve large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event. 
* Use CDN to achieve distribution of user requests and serving of content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server.

## How can I get started?

### Supported client libraries 

As a developer, you can use Media Services [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/) or client libraries that allow you to interact with the REST API, to easily create, manage, and maintain custom media workflows. Microsoft generates and supports the following client libraries: 

* .NET languages,
* .NET Core, 
* Java, 
* Node.js, 
* Azure CLI 2.0

Media Services provides [Swagger files](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification/mediaservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.Media) that you can use to generate SDKs for your preferred language/technology. You can use [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) to generate client libraries. 

### Jump right in

The following quickstart shows you how to create an Azure Media Services account, upload a file based on the specified URL, encode it, and stream the video: [Stream your files](stream-files-dotnet-quickstart.md)

For a more advanced streaming scenario, see [Tutorial: Upload, encode, stream](stream-files-tutorial.md).
