# Monitor Media Services metrics and diagnostic logs

Azure Media Services uses [Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md) to enable you to monitor metrics and diagnostic logs that help you understand how your applications are performing. If there are critical conditions identified in the data, you can choose to be alerted so you can quickly respond to issues. 

For detailed information, see [Metrics](../../azure-monitor/platform/data-collection.md) and [Diagnostic logs](../../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-overview.md).

This topic discusses currently available Media Services [metrics](#media-services-metrics) and [diagnostic logs](#media-services-diagnostic-logs).

## Media Services metrics

Currently, you can view the following metrics:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Requests|Gives details around total # of requests serviced by streaming endpoint|
|Egress|Total number of egress bytes. For example, bytes streamed by streaming endpoint.|
|Success end to end Latency| Gives information about end to end latency of successful requests.|

You can view metrics using [the Azure portal](#view-metrics-using-portal) or [query metrics using the Azure CLI](#query-metrics-using-cli). 

### View metrics using portal 

You can view metrics using the Azure portal either from Azure Monitor or from your Media Services account.

#### Azure Monitor - Metrics 

In the Azure portal, navigate to **Monitor** -> **Metrics**.

## Media Services diagnostic logs

Currently, you can get the following diagnostic logs:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Key delivery service request|Logs that show the delivery service request information. For more details, see [schema](media-services-diagnostic-logs-schema.md)|
|Streaming endpoint|Logs that show the streaming endpoint information. For more details, see [schema](media-services-diagnostic-logs-schema.md)|

### Access diagnostic logs

To enable diagnostic logs for your Media Services Azure Resource Manager resource, use the following Azure CLI command. In the command, you need to provide the storage account into which you want for the Media Services logs to be written.
