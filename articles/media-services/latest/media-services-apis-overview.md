# Developing with Media Services v3 APIs

This article discusses rules that apply to entities and APIs when developing with Media Services v3.

## Naming conventions

Azure Media Services v3 resource names (for example, Assets, Jobs, Transforms) are subject to Azure Resource Manager naming constraints. In accordance with Azure Resource Manager, the resource names are always unique. Thus, you can use any unique identifier strings (for example, GUIDs) for your resource names. 

Media Services resource names cannot include: '<', '>', '%', '&', ':', '&#92;', '?', '/', '*', '+', '.', the single quote character, or any control characters. All other characters are allowed. The max length of a resource name is 260 characters. 

For more information about Azure Resource Manager naming, see: [Naming requirements](https://github.com/Azure/azure-resource-manager-rpc/blob/master/v1.0/resource-api-reference.md#arguments-for-crud-on-resource) and [Naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions).

## v3 API design principles and RBAC

One of the key design principles of the v3 API is to make the API more secure. v3 APIs do not return secrets or credentials on a **Get** or **List** operation. The keys are always null, empty, or sanitized from the response. You need to call a separate action method to get secrets or credentials. Separate actions enable you to set different RBAC security permissions in case some APIs do retrieve/display secrets while other APIs do not. 

Examples of this include:

* Not returning ContentKey values in the Get of the StreamingLocator.
* Not returning the restriction keys in the Get of the ContentKeyPolicy.
* Not returning the query string part of the URL (to remove the signature) of Jobs' HTTP Input URLs.

For information, see:

- [Use RBAC to manage access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-rest)
- [Role-based access control for Media Services accounts](rbac-overview.md)
- [Get content key policy - .NET](get-content-key-policy-dotnet-howto.md).

## Long-running operations

The operations marked with `x-ms-long-running-operation` in the Azure Media Services [swagger files](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/mediaservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.Media/stable/2018-07-01/streamingservice.json) are long running operations. 

For details about how to track asynchronous Azure operations, see [Async operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-async-operations#monitor-status-of-operation).

Media Services has the following long-running operations:

* Create LiveEvent
* Update LiveEvent
* Delete LiveEvent
* Start LiveEvent
* Stop LiveEvent
* Reset LiveEvent
* Create LiveOutput
* Delete LiveOutput
* Create StreamingEndpoint
* Update StreamingEndpoint
* Delete StreamingEndpoint
* Start StreamingEndpoint
* Stop StreamingEndpoint
* Scale StreamingEndpoint
