# Quickstart: Stream video files - .NET

> [!NOTE]
> The latest version of Azure Media Services (2018-03-30) is in preview. This version is also called v3.

When streaming videos, you would likely want for your customers to be able to play videos on a wide variety of browsers and devices. Thus, you would want to deliver adaptive bitrate content in various formats (for example, HLS, MPEG DASH, and Smooth Streaming). For both on-demand and live streaming delivery to various clients (mobile devices, TV, PC, etc.) the content needs to be encoded and packaged appropriately.

This quickstart shows you how easy it is to start delivering videos with adaptive bitrate streaming using Media Services .NET SDK. 

In the quickstart, you are first offered to clone a GitHub repository that contains the **EncodeAndStreamFiles** project. The project contains .NET code that uploads a video file based on the specified URL, encodes the video, and prints out the streaming URLs. If you want to understand more about what the code is doing, see the [Upload, encode, and stream videos](stream-files-tutorial.md) tutorial. 

To run the application, you need to specify credentials needed to access Media Services API. 

The quickstart uses Azure Media Player to stream your video based on one of the URLs printed by the application.

## Prerequisites

+ An active [GitHub](https://github.com) account. 
+ Visual Studio. The example described in this quickstart uses Visual Studio 2017. 

    If you do not have Visual Studio installed, you can get [Visual Studio Community 2017, Visual Studio Professional 2017, or Visual Studio Enterprise 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
+ An Azure Media Services account. See the steps described in [Create a Media Services account](create-account-cli-quickstart.md).

## Clone the sample application

First, let's clone the [StreamAndEncodeFiles](https://github.com/azure-samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-quickstarts) app from GitHub. Visual Studio 2017 was used to create the sample.

1. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and `CD` to a working directory.  
2. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-quickstarts.git
    ```
3. Open the solution file in Visual Studio. 
4. Right-click the **EncodeAndStreamFiles** project and select **Set as StartUp project**.
5. Build the solution. 

You can open Program.cs file and examine the code and code comments. If you want to understand more about what the code is doing, please see the [Upload, encode, and stream videos](stream-files-tutorial.md) tutorial. 

## Configure your app

To run the app and access the Media Services APIs, you need to specify the correct values in App.config. 
    
To get the values, see [Accessing APIs](access-api-cli-how-to.md).

## Run the app and get a streaming URL

When you run the application it prints streaming URLs for DASH, HLS, and Smooth Streaming. Copy the Smooth Streaming URL.

## Test with Azure Media Player

1. Open a web browser and browse to https://ampdemo.azureedge.net/.
2. In the **URL:** box, paste the Streaming URL value you got when you ran the application.  
3. Press **Update Player**.
