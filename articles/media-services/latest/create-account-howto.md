# Create a Media Services account

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

To start encrypting, encoding, analyzing, managing, and streaming media content in Azure, you need to create a Media Services account. The Media Services account needs to be associated with one or more storage accounts. This article describes steps for creating a new Azure Media Services account.

> [!NOTE]
> The Media Services account and all associated storage accounts must be in the same Azure subscription. It is strongly recommended to use storage accounts in the same location as the Media Services account to avoid additional latency and data egress costs.

 You can use either the Azure portal or the CLI to create a Media Services account. Choose the tab for the method you would like to use.
