# Media Services compliance

Media Services meet the demanding requirements of the US Federal Risk & Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and of the US Department of Defense, from information impact levels 2 through 5. By deploying protected services including Azure Government, Office 365 U.S. Government, and Dynamics 365 Government, federal and defense agencies can leverage a rich array of compliant services. Read more about Azure services compliance in the [Azure services by FedRAMP and DoD CC SRG audit scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/compliance/azure-services-in-fedramp-auditscope) article.
