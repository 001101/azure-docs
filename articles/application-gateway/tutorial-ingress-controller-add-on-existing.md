# Tutorial: Enable Application Gateway Ingress Controller Add-On for an existing AKS Cluster with an existing Application Gateway Through Azure CLI (Preview)

You can use Azure CLI to enable the [Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC)](ingress-controller-overview.md) add-on, which is currently in preview, for your [Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/) cluster. In this tutorial, you will create an AKS cluster in one Virtual Network, create an Application Gateway in a separate Virtual Network, enable the AGIC add-on and peer the two Virtual Networks together. You'll then deploy a sample application which will utilize the AGIC add-on to connect the Application Gateway to the AKS cluster. If you're enabling the AGIC add-on for an Application Gateway and AKS cluster in the same Virtual Network, then you can skip the peering step below. The add-on provides a much faster way of deploying AGIC for your AKS cluster than previously through Helm and also offers a fully managed experience.  

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Create a resource group 
> * Create a new AKS cluster 
> * Create a new Application Gateway 
> * Enable the AGIC add-on in the existing AKS cluster with the existing Application Gateway

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires you to run the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To install/update the aks-preview extension for this tutorial, use the following Azure CLI commands
```azurecli-interactive
az extension add --name aks-preview
az extension list
```
```azurecli-interactive
az extension update --name aks-preview
az extension list
```

## Create a resource group

In Azure, you allocate related resources to a resource group. Create a resource group by using [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create). The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *canadacentral* location (region). 

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location canadacentral
```

## Deploy a new AKS cluster

You will now deploy a new AKS cluster, to simulate having an existing AKS cluster that you want to enable the AGIC add-on on.  

In the following example, you'll be deploying a new AKS cluster named *myCluster* using [Azure CNI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/concepts-network#azure-cni-advanced-networking) and [Managed Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-managed-identity) in the resource group we just created, *myResourceGroup*.    

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -n myCluster -g myResourceGroup --network-plugin azure --enable-managed-identity 
```

To configure additional parameters for the `az aks create` command, visit references [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-create). 

## Deploy a new Application Gateway 

You will now deploy a new Application Gateway, to simulate having an existing Application Gateway that you want to use to load balance traffic to your AKS cluster, *myCluster*. The name of the Application Gateway will be *myApplicationGateway*, but you will need to first create a public IP resource, named *myPublicIp*, and a new Virtual Network called *myVnet* with address space 11.0.0.0/8, and a subnet with address space 11.1.0.0/16 called *mySubnet*, and deploy your Application Gateway in *mySubnet* using *myPublicIp*. 

```azurecli-interactive
az network public-ip create -n myPublicIp -g MyResourceGroup --allocation-method Static --sku Standard
az network vnet create -n myVnet -g myResourceGroup --address-prefix 11.0.0.0/8 --subnet-name mySubnet --subnet-prefix 11.1.0.0/16 
az network application-gateway create -n myApplicationGateway -l canadacentral -g myResourceGroup --sku Standard_v2 --public-ip-address myPublicIp --vnet-name myVnet --subnet mySubnet
```

> [!NOTE]
> Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) add-on **only** supports Application Gateway v2 SKUs (Standard and WAF), and **not** the Application Gateway v1 SKUs. 

## Enable the AGIC add-on in the existing AKS cluster with the existing Application Gateway 

Now, you'll enable the AGIC add-on in the AKS cluster you created, *myCluster*, and specify the AGIC add-on to use the existing Application Gateway you created, *myApplicationGateway*. Make sure you've added/updated the aks-preview extension at the beginning of this tutorial. 

```azurecli-interactive
appgwId=$(az network application-gateway show -n myApplicationGateway -g myResourceGroup -o tsv --query "id") 
az aks enable-addons -n myCluster -g myResourceGroup -a ingress-appgw --appgw-id $appgwId
```

## Peer the Application Gateway virtual network with the AKS cluster virtual network

Since we deployed the AKS cluster in its own Virtual Network and the Application Gateway it another Virtual Network, you'll need to peer the two Virtual Networks together in order for AGIC to communicate with the Application Gateway. Peering two 

```azurecli-interactive
nodeResourceGroup=$(az aks show -n myCluster -g myResourceGroup -o tsv --query "nodeResourceGroup")
aksVnetName=$(az network vnet list -g $nodeResourceGroup -o tsv --query "[0].name")

vnetId=$(az network vnet show -n $aksVnetName -g MC_$nodeResourceGroup -o tsv --query "id")
az network vnet peering create -n AppGWtoAKSVnetPeering -g myResourceGroup --vnet-name myVnet --remote-vnet $vnetId --enable-vnet-access

vnetId2=$(az network vnet show -n myVnet -g myResourceGroup3 -o tsv --query "id")
az network vnet peering create -n AKStoAppGWVnetPeering -g $nodeResourceGroup --vnet-name $aksVnetName --remote-vnet $vnetId2 --enable-vnet-access
```
## Deploy a sample application using AGIC for Ingress on the AKS cluster

You will now deploy a sample application to the AKS cluster you created that will use the AGIC add-on for Ingress and connect the Application Gateway to the AKS cluster. First, you'll get credentials to the AKS cluster you deployed by running the `az aks get-credentials` command. 

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials -n myCluster -g myResourceGroup
```

Once you have the credentials to the cluster you created, run the following command to set up a sample application that uses AGIC for Ingress to the cluster. AGIC will communicate to the Application Gateway you set up earlier that there is a change in the cluster and update the backend pool with the new information. 

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/master/docs/examples/aspnetapp.yaml 
```

## Check the Application Gateway connection to AKS cluster 

Now that the Application Gateway is set up to serve traffic to the AKS cluster, let's verify that it's actually connected. You'll first get the IP address of the Ingress. 

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get ingress
```

Check that the sample app you created is up and running by either visiting the IP address of the Application Gateway that you got from running the above command in your browser or check with `curl`. It may take Application Gateway a minute to get the update, so if the Application Gateway is still in an "Updating" state on Portal, then let it finish before trying to reach the IP address. 

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, remove the resource group, application gateway, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --location canadacentral
```
