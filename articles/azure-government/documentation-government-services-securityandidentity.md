# Azure Government security and identity
## Key Vault
For details about Key Vault and how to use it, see the [Azure Key Vault public documentation](../key-vault/index.md).

### Data considerations
The following information identifies the Azure Government boundary for Azure Key Vault:

| Regulated/controlled data that's permitted | Regulated/controlled data that's not permitted |
| --- | --- |
| All data that's encrypted with Azure Key Vault key might contain regulated or controlled data. |Azure Key Vault metadata cannot contain export-controlled data. This metadata includes all configuration data that you enter while creating and maintaining  Key Vault.  Do not enter regulated or controlled data into the following fields: Resource group names, Key Vault names, Subscription names. |

Key Vault is generally available in Azure Government. There is no extension, so Key Vault is available through PowerShell and CLI only.
