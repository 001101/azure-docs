# Isolation guidelines for Impact Level 5 workloads

Azure Government supports applications in all regions that require Impact Level 5 (IL5) data, as defined in the [US Department of Defense Cloud Security Requirements Guide (SRG)](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/cloud/SRG/index.html). IL5 workloads have a higher degree of impact to the US Department of Defense and must be secured to a higher standard. When you deploy these workloads on Azure Government, you can meet their isolation requirements in various ways. The guidance in this document will address configurations and settings to meet the isolation required to support IL5 data. We'll update this document as new implementations are enabled and as new services are accredited for IL5 data by DISA.

## Background

In January 2017, the Impact Level 5 Provisional Authorization (PA) for Azure Government was the first provided to a hyperscale cloud provider. This authorization covered two regions of Azure Government (US DoD Central and US DoD East) that were dedicated to the DoD. Based on mission owner feedback and evolving security capabilities, Microsoft has partnered with DISA to expand the IL5 PA in December 2018 to cover all six Azure Government regions while still honoring the isolation requirements needed by the Department of Defense.

Azure Government continues to provide more PaaS features and services to the DoD at Impact Level 5 than any other cloud provider.

## Principles and approach

Two key areas need to be addressed for services in Impact Level 5 scope: storage isolation and compute isolation. We'll focus on how these services can isolate the compute and storage of Impact Level 5 data.  The SRG allows for a shared management and network infrastructure.

### Compute isolation

The SRG focuses on the segmentation of compute during "processing" of data for Impact Level 5. This segmentation ensures that a virtual machine that compromises the physical host can't affect a DoD workload. To remove the risk of runtime attacks and ensure long running workloads aren't compromised from other workloads on the same host, all Impact Level 5 virtual machines should be isolated via Azure Dedicated Host. Doing so provides a dedicated physical server to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux. 

For services where the compute processes are obfuscated from access by the owner and stateless in their processing of data, you should accomplish isolation by focusing on the data being processed and how it's stored and retained. This approach ensures that the data is stored in protected mediums and not present on these services for extended periods unless it's encrypted as needed.

### Storage isolation

In the most recent PA for Azure Government, DISA approved logical separation of IL5 from other data via cryptographic means. In Azure, this approach involves encryption via keys that are maintained in Azure Key Vault. The keys are owned and managed by the IL5 system owner.

To apply this approach to services:

- If a service hosts only IL5 data, the service can control the key on behalf of end users. But it must use a dedicated key to protect IL5 data from all other data in the cloud.
- If a service will host IL5 and non-DoD data, the service must expose the option to for end users to use their own keys for encryption. Those keys are stored in Azure Key Vault. This implementation gives consumers of the service the ability to implement cryptographic separation as needed.

This approach ensures all key material for decrypting data is stored separately of the data itself and done so with a hardware key-management solution.

## Applying this guidance

Impact Level 5 guidelines require workloads to be deployed with a high degree of security, isolation, and control. The following configurations are required in *addition* to any other configurations or controls needed to meet Impact Level 5. Network isolation, access controls, and other necessary security measures aren't necessarily addressed in the guidance here.

Be sure to review the entry for each service you're using and ensure that all isolation requirements are implemented.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <sup>1</sup>When you deploy VMs in these regions, you must use Azure Dedicated Host, as described in the next section.

#### [Azure Dedicated Host](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/)

Azure Dedicated Host provides physical servers that can host one or more virtual machines and that are dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our datacenters, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, Availability Zone, and fault domain. You can then place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration meets your needs.

These VMs provide the necessary level of isolation required to support IL5 workloads when deployed outside of the dedicated DoD regions. When you use Dedicated Host, your Azure VMs are placed on an isolated and dedicated physical server that runs only your organization’s workloads to meet compliance guidelines and standards.

Current Dedicated Host SKUs (VM series and Host Type) that offer the required compute isolation include SKUs in the VM families listed on the [Dedicated Host pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/).

#### Isolated virtual machines

Virtual machine scale sets aren't currently supported on Azure Dedicated Host. But specific VM types, when deployed, consume the entire physical host for the VM. Each of the following VM types can be deployed via virtual machine scale sets to provide proper compute isolation with all the benefits of virtual machine scale sets in place. When you configure your scale set, select the appropriate SKU. To encrypt the data at rest, see the next section for supportable encryption options.

Current VM SKUs that offer the required compute isolation include SKUs in these VM families:

| **VM family** | **VM SKU** |
| --- | --- |
| D-Series (general purpose) | Standard\_DS15\_v2Standard\_D15\_v2 |
| Memory optimized | Standard\_E64is\_v3Standard\_E64i\_v3 |
| Compute optimized | Standard\_F72s\_v2 |
| Large memory optimized | Standard\_M128ms |
| GPU-enabled | Standard\_NV24 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As new hardware generations become available, some VM types might require reconfiguration (scale up or migration to a new VM SKU) to ensure they remain on properly dedicated hardware. This document will be updated to reflect any changes.

#### Disk Encryption for virtual machines

You can encrypt the storage that supports these virtual machines in one of two ways to support necessary encryption standards.

- Use Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt the drives by using dm-crypt (Linux) or BitLocker (Windows):
  - [Enable Azure Disk Encryption for Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview.md)
  - [Enable Azure Disk Encryption for Windows](../virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview.md)
- Use Azure Storage service encryption for storage accounts with your own key to encrypt the storage account that holds the disks:
  - [Storage service encryption with customer-managed keys](../storage/common/customer-managed-keys-configure-key-vault.md)

#### Disk Encryption for virtual machine scale sets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <sup>1</sup>Tables and Queues when used outside the **USDoD Regions** must encrypt the data before inserting into the Table and Queue. For more information refer to the instructions for using [client side encryption](../storage/common/storage-client-side-encryption-java.md).

#### Storage Encryption with Key Vault Managed Keys

To implement Impact Level 5 compliant controls on an Azure Storage account running in Azure Government outside of the dedicated DoD regions, Encryption at Rest must be implemented with the customer-managed key option enabled (also known as bring-your-own-key).

For more information on how to enable this Azure Storage Encryption feature, please review the supporting documentation for [Azure Storage](../storage/common/customer-managed-keys-configure-key-vault.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When using this encryption method, it is important that it is enabled BEFORE content is added to the storage account. Any content added prior will not be encrypted with the selected key, and only encrypted using standard encryption at rest provided by Azure Storage.`
