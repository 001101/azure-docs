# Develop with Azure DevOps Services

This article demonstrates how to set up continuous deployment to your web app running in Azure Government using Azure DevOps Services. Continuous deployment (CD) means starting an automated deployment process whenever a code change is made to your application or whenever a new successful build is available. Azure DevOps Services is used by teams to configure continuous deployment for their applications hosted in their Azure subscriptions. Refer to [CI/CD for newbies](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/get-started/ci-cd-part-1) for an overview of CI/CD with Azure DevOps Services.

[Release Management in Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/overview) is a service that enables continuous deployment for various applications. We can use this service for applications running in Azure Government by defining [service endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints) for Azure Government. 

Azure DevOps Services itself is not available in Azure Government Clouds. When CD is configured using Azure DevOps Services to deploy apps to Azure Government clouds, artifact storage, build, and (or) deployment orchestration for the app would execute outside the government cloud. To learn more about Azure DevOps Services, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/index). 

If you don't have an Azure Government subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/clouds/government/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* Review [Guidance for developers](documentation-government-developer-guide.md).<br/> This article discusses Azure Government's unique URLs and endpoints for managing your environment. You must know about these endpoints in order to connect to Azure Government. 
* Review [Compare Azure Government and global Azure](compare-azure-government-global-azure.md) and click on a service of interest to see variations between Azure Government and global Azure.
+ Have an [Azure DevOps Services organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization-msa-or-work-student) and [Azure DevOps Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?tabs=vsts)
+ Install and set up [Azure Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-5.1.1)

## Create Azure Government app service 

[Create an App service in your Azure Government subscription](documentation-government-howto-deploy-webandmobile.md). 
The following steps will set up a CD process to deploy to this Web App. 

## Set up Build and Source control integration
Follow through one of the quickstarts below to set up a Build for your specific type of app: 

- [ASP.NET Core app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/dotnet-core?tabs=github%2Cweb%2Cdeploy-windows)
- [ASP.NET 4 app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-4?tabs=vsts)
- [Node.js app with Gulp](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/archive/apps/nodejs/nodejs-to-azure)

## Generate a service principal 

1. Download or copy and paste [this powershell script](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-rm-documentation/blob/master/Azure/SPNCreation.ps1) into an IDE or editor. 
2. Open up the file and navigate to the `param` parameter. Replace the `$environmentName` variable with 
AzureUSGovernment." This sets the service principal to be created in Azure Government.
3. Open your Powershell window and run the following command: 
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass ` 
    Setting this policy enables running local files. Enter "A" when you are shown the following: 

    ![ps1](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img8.png)

4. Navigate to the directory that has the edited script above. 
5. Edit the following command with the name of your script and run:
    `./<name of script file you saved> `
6. The "subscriptionName" parameter can be found by logging into your Azure Government subscription with `Connect-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName AzureUSGovernment` and then running `Get-AzureSubscription`. 
7. When prompted for the "password" parameter, you can enter your desired password. 

    ![ps2](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img9.png)
8. After providing your Azure Government subscription credentials you should see the following: 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Environment variable should be "AzureUSGovernment"
    > 
    > 

    ![ps3](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img10.png)
9. After the script has run, you should see your service connection values. Copy these values as we will need them when setting up our endpoint. 

    ![ps4](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img11.png)

## Configure the Azure DevOps Services Endpoint

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that you add the endpoint soon after running the Powershell script above, as the key expires. 
> If not, you navigate to the [Azure Government portal](https://portal.azure.us) -> AAD -> App registrations -> Add Key
>

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps Project from your Visual Studio Account. 
2. Navigate to the Services tab and click on "New Service Endpoint".    

    ![azuredevops1](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img12.png)
3. Choose "Azure Resource Manager" from the dropdown menu. 

    ![azuredevops2](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img13.png)
4. Click on the blue text in order to set up the service principal. 
	
    ![azuredevops3](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img14.png)
5. Fill out the dialog with "AzureUSGovernment" for the "Environment" parameter and choose a friendly name for "Connection Name". Fill out the rest of dialog with the Service Connection values generated in **Step 9 of the "Generate a Service Principal" section above**. Click "Verify Connection" in the bottom right corner, make sure it says "Verified", and then click "Ok".

    ![azuredevops4](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img15.png)
6. Confirm your build has been created successfully.

    ![azuredevops5](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img16.png)

## Define a Release Process

1. After you have completed the steps above, we can now define the release process for our build.
2. Choose the link to the completed build (for example, Build 1634). In the build's Summary tab under Deployments, choose "Create release". This starts a new release pipeline that's automatically linked to the build pipeline.

    ![azuredevops6](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img17.png)
3. Select the Azure App Service Deployment template and choose Next.

    ![azuredevops7](./media/documentation-government-vsts-img18.png)

	In "Source..." make sure your CI build pipeline for the Web deploy package is selected as the artifact source.
4. Select the Continuous deployment check box, and then choose Create.
5. Select the Deploy Azure App Service task and configure it as follows:
 	- Azure Subscription: Select the endpoint configured earlier
	- App Service Name: the name of the web app (the part of the URL without .azurewebsites.us).
	- Deploy to Slot: make sure this is cleared (the default)
	- Virtual Application: leave blank
	- Web Deploy Package: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)\**\*.zip (the default)
	- Advanced: Take App Offline: If you run into locked .DLL problems when you test the release, as explained below, try selecting this check box.
		
	
6. Edit the name of the release pipeline, choose Save, and choose OK. The default environment is named Environment1, which you can edit by clicking directly on the name.
	
Now that your pipeline has been constructed, you can [deploy changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/) to your applications in Azure Government. 

## Q&A
* Do I need a build agent?
You need at least one [agent](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/concepts/agents/agents) to run your deployments. By default, the build and deployment processes are configured to use the [hosted agents](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/concepts/agents/hosted). Configuring a private agent would limit data sharing outside of Azure Government.
