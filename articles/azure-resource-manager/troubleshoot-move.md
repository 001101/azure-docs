# Troubleshoot moving Azure resources to new resource group or subscription

## When to call Azure support

You can move most resources through the self-service operations shown in this article. Use the self-service operations to:

* Move Resource Manager resources.
* Move classic resources according to the [classic deployment limitations](./move-limitations/classic-deployment-move-limitations.md).

Contact [support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview) when you need to:

* Move your resources to a new Azure account (and Azure Active Directory tenant) and you need help with the instructions in the preceding section.
* Move classic resources but are having trouble with the limitations.
