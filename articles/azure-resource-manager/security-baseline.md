# Azure security baseline for Azure Resource Manager

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Resource Manager. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Resource Manager. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Resource Manager have been excluded.

 To see how Azure Resource Manager completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Resource Manager security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

You can also enable a Just-In-Time access by using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management and Azure Resource Manager.

## Secure configuration

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Secure configuration](../security/benchmarks/security-control-secure-configuration.md).*

### 7.1: Establish secure configurations for all Azure resources

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32047.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Policy aliases &lt;!--- in the "Microsoft.Resources" namespace --!&gt; to create custom policies to audit or enforce the configuration of your Azure resources. You may also use built-in Azure Policy definitions.

Azure Resource Manager has the ability to export the template in Java Script Object Notation (JSON), which should be reviewed to ensure that the configurations meet the security requirements for your organization.

You can also use the recommendations from Azure Security Center as a secure configuration baseline for your Azure resources.

**Guidance**: Use Azure Policy [deny] and [deploy if not exist] to enforce secure settings across your Azure resources.  In addition, you can use Azure Resource Manager templates to maintain the security configuration of your Azure resources required by your organization. 

Additionally, as an administrator, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly.

**Guidance**: Implement Template security best
practices on this page: Best
practices for templates - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Docs

- Always use parameters for user names and passwords (or secrets).

- Use securestring for all passwords and secrets. If
you pass sensitive data in a JSON object, use the secureObject type.
Template parameters with secure string or secure object types can't be read
after resource deployment.

"secretValue": {

  
      "type": "securestring",

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
