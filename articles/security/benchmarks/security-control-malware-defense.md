# Security Control: Malware Defense

## 8.1: Use centrally managed anti-malware software

| Azure ID | CIS IDs | Responsibility |

| 8.1 | 8.1 | Customer |

Use Microsoft Antimalware for Azure Cloud Services and Virtual Machines to continuously monitor and defend your resources. For Linux, use third party antimalware solution.

## 8.2: Pre-scan files to be uploaded to non-compute Azure resources

| Azure ID | CIS IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 8.2 | 8.1 | Customer |

Microsoft Antimalware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services (for example, Azure App Service), however it does not run on your content.

Pre-scan any files being uploaded to non-compute Azure resources, such as App Service, Data Lake Storage, Blob Storage, etc.

Use Azure Security Center's Threat detection for data services to detect malware uploaded to storage accounts.

| 8.3 | 8.2 | Customer |

Microsoft Antimalware will automatically install the latest signatures and engine updates by default. Follow recommendations in Azure Security Center: "Compute &amp; Apps" to ensure all endpoints are up to date with the latest signatures. For Linux, use third party antimalware solution.
