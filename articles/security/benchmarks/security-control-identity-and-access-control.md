# Security Control: Identity and Access Control

## 3.1: Maintain Inventory of Administrative Accounts

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.1 | 4.1 | Customer |

Azure AD has built-in roles that must be explicitly assigned and are queryable. Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform adhoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups.

How to query Azure AD Roles and Role membership with PowerShell:
https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/get-azureaddirectoryrole?view=azureadps-2.0
https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/get-azureaddirectoryrolemember?view=azureadps-2.0

## 3.2: Change Default Passwords where Applicable

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.2 | 4.2 | Customer |

Azure AD does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. Customer responsible for third party applications and marketplace services that may utilize default passwords.

## 3.3: Use Dedicated Administrative Accounts

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.3 | 4.3 | Customer |

Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

You can also enable a Just-In-Time / Just-Enough-Access by using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management Privileged Roles for Microsoft Services, and Azure ARM.

## 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory Single Sign-On (SSO)

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.4 | 4.4 | Customer |

Wherever possible, use Azure Active Directory SSO instead than configuring individual stand-alone credentials per-service. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations.

Understanding SSO with Azure AD:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on

## 3.5: Use Multifactor Authentication for all Azure Active Directory based access.

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.5 | 4.5, 11.5, 12.11, 16.3 | Customer |

Enable Azure AD MFA and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations.

How to enable MFA in Azure:

https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted

How to monitor identity and access within Azure Security Center:

https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-identity-access

## 3.6: Use Dedicated Machines (Privileged Access Workstations) for all Administrative Tasks

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.6 | 4.6, 11.6, 12.12 | Customer |

Use PAWs (privileged access workstations) with MFA configured to log into and configure Azure resources.

Learn about Privileged Access Workstations:
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/privileged-access-workstations

How to enable MFA in Azure:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted

## 3.7: Limit users' ability to interact with ARM via scripting tools.

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.7 | 4.7 | Customer |

Use Azure Conditional Access to limit users' ability to interact with ARM by configuring &quot;Block access&quot; for the &quot;Microsoft Azure Management&quot; App.

How to configure Conditional Access to block access to ARM:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/conditional-access-azure-management

## 3.8: Log and Alert on Suspicious Activity from Administrative Accounts

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.8 | 4.8, 4.9 | Customer |

Use Azure Active Directory security reports for generation of logs and alerts when suspicious or unsafe activity occurs in the environment. Use Azure Security Center to monitor identity and access activity

How to identify Azure AD users flagged for risky activity:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-user-at-risk

How to monitor users identity and access activity in Azure Security Center:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-identity-access

## 3.9: Manage Azure Resource from only Approved Locations

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.9 | 11.7 | Customer |

Use Conditional Access Named Locations to allow access from only specific logical groupings of IP address ranges or countries/regions.

How to configure Named Locations in Azure:

https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations

## 3.10: Use Azure Active Directory

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.10 | 16.1, 16.2, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6 | Customer |

Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) as the central authentication and authorization system. AAD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. AAD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

How to create and configure an AAD instance:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant

## 3.11: Regularly Review and Reconcile User Access

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.11 | 16.9, 16.10 | Customer |

Azure AD provides logs to help discover stale accounts. In addition, use Azure Identity Access Reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right Users have continued access. 

Azure AD Reporting 
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/

How to use Azure Identity Access Reviews:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview

## 3.12: Monitor Attempts to Access Deactivated Accounts

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.12 | 16.12 | Customer |

You have access to Azure AD Sign in Activity, Audit and Risk Event log sources, which allow you to integrate with any SIEM / Monitoring tool.

 You can streamline this process by creating Diagnostic Settings for Azure Active Directory user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics Workspace. You can configure desired Alerts within Log Analytics Workspace.

How to integrate Azure Activity Logs into Azure Monitor:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics

## 3.13: Alert on Account Login Behavior Deviation

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.13 | 16.13 | Customer |

Use Azure AD Risk and Identity Protection features to configure automated responses to detected suspicious actions related to user identities. You can also ingest data into Azure Sentinel for further investigation.

How to view Azure AD risky sign-ins:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risky-sign-ins

How to configure and enable Identity Protection risk policies:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies

## 3.14: Regulate third-party access to company data

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| 3.14 | 16 | Customer |

In cases where a third party needs to access customer data (such as during a support request), use Customer Lockbox for Azure to review, approve, or reject customer data access requests.
