>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40088.).

**Guidance**: Azure Front Door uses Azure RBAC to isolate access to business-critical systems by restricting which accounts are granted privileged access to the subscriptions and management groups they are in.

Ensure that you also restrict access to the management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business critical access such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.

All types of access controls should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy to ensure consistent access control.

### PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege principle) 

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40093.).

**Guidance**: Azure Front Door is integrated with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage its resources. Azure RBAC allows you to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. The privileges you assign to resources through the Azure RBAC should be always limited to what is required by the roles. This complements the just in time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and should be reviewed periodically.

Use built-in roles to allocate permission and only create custom role when required.

### DP-4: Encrypt sensitive information in transit

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40104.).

**Guidance**: Encryption is critical for traffic on external and public networks.
Use access controls,

data in transit should be protected against ‘out of band’ attacks (e.g. traffic capture) using encryption to ensure that attackers cannot easily read or modify the data.

Ensure for HTTP traffic, that any clients connecting to your Azure resources can negotiate TLS v1.2 or greater.

For remote management, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of unencrypted protocol. Obsoleted SSL/TLS/SSH versions, protocols, and weak ciphers should be disabled.

At the underlying infrastructure, Azure provides data in transit encryption by default for data traffic between Azure data centers.

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40115.).

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives.

High quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources.

Azure Security Center provides high quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation.

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40116.).

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots. You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information.

Snapshots of running systems:

Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk.

Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

### IR-5: Detection and analysis – prioritize incidents

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40117.).

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity.

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

### IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery – automate the incident handling

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40118.).

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks.

Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.
