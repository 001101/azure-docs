# Security Control: Vulnerability Management

## 5.1: Run Automated Vulnerability Scanning Tools

| Azure ID | CIS Control IDs | Responsibility |

| 5.1 | 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 | Customer |

Follow recommendations from Azure Security Center on performing vulnerability assessments on your Azure Virtual Machines, Container Images, and SQL Servers.<br><br>Utilize third a party solution for performing vulnerability assessments on network devices and web applications. When conducting remote scans, do not use a single, perpetual, administrative account. Consider implementing JIT provisioning methodology for the scan account. Credentials for the scan account should be protected, monitored, and used only for vulnerability scanning.<br><br>How to implement Azure Security Center vulnerability assessment recommendations:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-recommendations

## 5.2: Deploy Automated Operating System Patch Management Solution
