# Security Control: Identity Management

Identity and access management recommendations focus on addressing issues related to identity-based access control, locking down administrative access, alerting on identity-related events, abnormal account behavior, and role-based access control.

## 3.1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

| Azure ID | CIS IDs | NIST IDs |
|--|--|--|--|
| 3.1 | 16.1, 16.2, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6 | AC-3, IA-7, IA-8 |

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Azure's default identity and access management service. Standardize Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management in:

- Microsoft Cloud resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machine (Linux and Windows), Azure Key Vault, PaaS, and SaaS applications.

- Your organization's resources, such as applications on Azure or your corporate network resources.

Azure AD supports external identity providers that allow users without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with their external identity.

Azure AD provides an identity secure score to help you assess your identity security posture relative to Microsoft’s best practice recommendations. Use the score to gauge how closely your configuration matches best practice recommendations, and to make improvements in your security posture.

## 3.2: Manage application identities securely and automatically

| Azure ID | CIS IDs | NIST IDs |
|--|--|--|--|
| 3.2 | N/A | AC-2, AC-3, IA-2, IA-4 |

For application identities such as service accounts used by applications or automation tools, use Azure AD to create a service principal type identity that can set with restricted permissions at the resource level instead of using a more powerful human account to access or execute your resources. You can use Azure Key Vault to manage service principal secrets to avoid hard coding credentials in source or configuration file. 
In addition, Azure AD also supports a managed identity feature that can be enabled for certain Azure services. The managed identity can natively authenticate to the Azure services/resources that supports Azure AD authentication through pre-defined access grant rule without using credential hard coded in source code or configuration file. Unlike service principal, managed identity does not require registration in Azure Key Vault for secrets management.

## 3.3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

| Azure ID | CIS IDs | NIST IDs |
|--|--|--|--|
| 3.3 | 4.4 | IA-2, IA-4 |

Azure AD Business-to-Business (B2B): 
Wherever possible, use Azure Active Directory SSO instead of configuring individual stand-alone credentials per-service. Azure AD supports cloud and on-premises applications using Azure AD for authentication. Azure AD B2B allows guest users without a Microsoft account to sign in to Azure or non-Azure applications and resources with users’ external identities for cross-organization collaboration.

Azure AD Business-to-Customer (B2C): 

Azure AD B2C is a customer identity access management service. It supports local account identities or customer’s social, enterprise identities to get single sign-on access to the applications and APIs.

## 3.4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

Azure AD supports multi-factor
authentication (MFA) or passwordlesss authentication as the strong
authentication mechanism. 

a) Multi-factor authentication - Enable Azure AD MFA and follow Azure Security
Center Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices
in your MFA setup. MFA can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user
level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors. 

b) Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are
available: a) Windows Hello for Business, b) Microsoft Authenticator app, c)
FIDO2 security keys For administrator and privileged
users, ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method are used,
followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other
users. For password-based authentication,
Azure AD does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources
that do require a password force it to be created with complexity requirements
and a minimum password length. The requirements differ depending on the
service. You are also responsible for third-party applications and marketplace
services that may use default passwords. Azure AD comes with a default password
policy that cannot be modified. You can use Azure AD custom banned passwords to
prevent certain known bad passwords being used or enforce a password change
when a known bad pair of user credentials from data breach are input by the
user. 

For managing on-premises/non-Azure
password policy through Azure AD, there are multiple options available
depending on your deployment model:

- Implement password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync- Enforce Azure AD weak password check
for on-premises Windows Server Active Directory

## 3.5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

Azure AD Identity Protection provides
the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated
with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more
sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases: Sign-ins
– The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed
applications and user sign-in activities.Audit
logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various
features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any
resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles
and policies.Risky
sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might
have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.Users
flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might
have been compromised. Azure Security Center can also alert
on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed
authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription.  Note: Azure Advanced Threat Protection
(ATP) is a security solution that can use Active Directory signals to identify,
detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious
insider actions.Refer to ASB 2. Logging and Monitoring
for more details about details in this area.

## 3.6: Restrict Azure resource access based on conditions

| Azure ID | CIS IDs | NIST IDs |
|--|--|--|--|
| 3.6 | 11.7 | AC-2 |

Use Azure AD conditional access for a more granular access control based on user-defined conditions, such as users logins from certain IP ranges will need to use MFA for login. Granular authentication session management policy can also be used for different use cases. 

Intune and Cloud App Security can also be used for more complicated conditional access controlling the device end and application end respectively.

## 3.7: Mitigate token theft and re-use

| Azure ID | CIS IDs | NIST IDs |
|--|--|--|--|
| 3.7 | N/A | AC-11, AC-12 |

Reducing the Access Token Lifetime property mitigates the risk of an access token or ID token being used by a malicious actor for an extended period of time. You can specify the lifetime of a token issued by Azure AD. You can also set token lifetimes for all apps in your organization, for a multi-tenant (multi-organization) application, or for a specific service principal in your organization.
