## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40010).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the default identity and access management service. You should standardize Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management in:
Microsoft Cloud resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machine (Linux and Windows), Azure Key Vault, PaaS, and SaaS applications.

Your organization's resources, such as applications on Azure or your corporate network resources.

Securing Azure AD should be a high priority in your organization’s cloud security practice. Azure AD provides an identity secure score to help you assess identity security posture relative to Microsoft’s best practice recommendations. Use the score to gauge how closely your configuration matches best practice recommendations, and to make improvements in your security posture.

Note: Azure AD supports external identity that allows users without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with their external identity.

### IM-2: Manage application identities securely and automatically

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40011).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager uses Azure-managed identities for service accounts used by Azure services or automation. It is recommended to use the Azure-managed identity feature instead of creating a more permissive user account to access or run your resources. Azure Firewall Manager can natively authenticate to the Azure services/resources that supports Azure AD authentication through pre-defined access grant rule without using credential hard coded in source code or configuration files.

- [Azure-managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) 

- [Services that support managed identities for Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40012).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager uses Azure Active Directory to provide identity and access management to Azure resources, cloud applications, and on-premises applications. This includes enterprise identities such as employees, as well as external identities such as partners, vendors, and suppliers. This enables single sign-on (SSO) to manage and secure access to your organization’s data and resources on-premises and in the cloud. Connect all your users, applications, and devices to the Azure AD for seamless, secure access and greater visibility and control.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40013).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager uses Azure Active Directory which supports strong authentication controls through multi-factor authentication (MFA), and strong passwordless methods.
Multi-factor authentication - Enable Azure AD MFA and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices in your MFA setup. MFA can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors.

Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method is used, followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40014).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager is integrated with Azure Active Directory in which provides the following data sources:
Sign-ins - The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

These data sources can be integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or third-party SIEM systems.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription.

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a security solution that can use Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions.

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access).*

### PA-1: Protect and limit highly privileged users

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40017).

**Guidance**: The most critical built-in roles are Azure AD are Global Administrator and the Privileged Role Administrator as users assigned to these two roles can delegate administrator roles:
Global Administrator / Company Administrator: Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure AD, as well as services that use Azure AD identities.

Privileged Role Administrator: Users with this role can manage role assignments in Azure AD, as well as within Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). In addition, this role allows management of all aspects of PIM and administrative units.

Note: You may have other critical roles that need to be governed if you use custom roles with certain privileged permissions assigned. And you may also want to apply similar controls to the administrator account of critical business assets.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-2: Restrict administrative access to business-critical systems

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40018).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager uses Azure RBAC to isolate access to business-critical systems by restricting which accounts are granted privileged access to the subscriptions and the management groups they are in.

Ensure that you also restrict access to the management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business critical access such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.

All types of access controls should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy to ensure consistent access control.

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40019).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts to manage its resources. Review user accounts and access assignment regularly to ensure the accounts and their access are valid. You can use Azure AD access reviews to review group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. Azure AD reporting can provide logs to help discover stale accounts. You can also use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to create access review report workflow to facilitate the review process.

In addition, Azure Privileged Identity Management can also be configured to alert when an excessive number of administrator accounts are created, and to identify administrator accounts that are stale or improperly configured.

Note: Some Azure services support local users and roles which not managed through Azure AD. You will need to manage these users separately.

### PA-4: Set up emergency access in Azure AD

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40020).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager uses Azure Active Directory to manage its resources. To prevent being accidentally locked out of your Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass"' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency.

### PA-6: Use privileged access workstations

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40022).

**Guidance**: Secured, isolated workstations are critically important for the security of sensitive roles like administrators, developers, and critical service operators. Use highly secured user workstations and/or Azure Bastion for administrative tasks. Use Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), and/or Microsoft Intune to deploy a secure and managed user workstation for administrative tasks. The secured workstations can be centrally managed to enforce secured configuration, including strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, and restricted logical and network access.

### PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege principle) 

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40023).

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall Manager is integrated with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage its resources. Azure RBAC allows you to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. The privileges you assign to resources through the Azure RBAC should be always limited to what is required by the roles. This complements the just in time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and should be reviewed periodically.

Use built-in roles to allocate permission and only create custom role when required.

## Data Protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-data-protection).*

### DP-1: Discovery, classify and label sensitive data

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40031).

**Guidance**: Not applicable. Azure Firewall Manager manages sensitive data but doesn't have capability to discover, classify, or label sensitive data.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### DP-2: Protect sensitive data

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40032).

**Guidance**: Protect sensitive data by restricting access using Azure Role Based Access Control (Azure RBAC), network-based access controls, and specific controls in Azure services (such as encryption in SQL and other databases).

To ensure consistent access control, all types of access control should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy. The enterprise segmentation strategy should also be informed by the location of sensitive or business critical data and systems.

For the underlying platform, which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and guards against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented some default data protection controls and capabilities.

### DP-3: Monitor for unauthorized transfer of sensitive data

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40033).

**Guidance**: Monitor for unauthorized transfer of data to locations outside of enterprise visibility and control. This typically involves monitoring for anomalous activities (large or unusual transfers) that could indicate unauthorized data exfiltration.

Azure Storage Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) and Azure SQL ATP can alert on anomalous transfer of information that might indicate unauthorized transfers of sensitive information.

Azure Information protection (AIP) provides monitoring capabilities for information that has been classified and labeled.

If required for compliance of data loss prevention (DLP), you can use a host-based DLP solution to enforce detective and/or preventative controls to prevent data exfiltration.

- [Enable Azure SQL ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/threat-detection-overview)

### DP-4: Encrypt sensitive information in transit

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40034).

**Guidance**: To complement access controls, data in transit should be protected against ‘out of band’ attacks (for example, traffic capture) using encryption to ensure that attackers cannot easily read or modify the data.

Azure Firewall Manager supports data encryption in transit with TLS v1.2 or greater.

While this is optional for traffic on private networks, this is critical for traffic on external and public networks. For HTTP traffic, ensure that any clients connecting to your Azure resources can negotiate TLS v1.2 or greater. For remote management, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of an unencrypted protocol. Obsoleted SSL, TLS, and SSH versions and protocols, and weak ciphers should be disabled.

By default, Azure provides encryption for data in transit between Azure data centers.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40035).

**Guidance**: Azure provides encryption for data at rest by default. For highly sensitive data, you have options to implement additional encryption at rest on all Azure resources where available. Azure manages your encryption keys by default, but Azure provides options to manage your own keys (customer-managed keys) for certain Azure services.

## Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Asset Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-asset-management).*

### AM-1: Ensure security team has visibility into risks for assets

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40053).

**Guidance**: Ensure security teams are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Azure Security Center. 

Depending on how security team responsibilities are structured, monitoring for security risks could  be the responsibility of a central security team or a local team. That said, security insights and risks must always be aggregated centrally within an organization. 

Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (Root Management Group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions. 

Note: Additional permissions might be required to get visibility into workloads and services.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40037).

**Guidance**: Azure AD provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:

Sign-ins – The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Azure Security Center’s Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you have visibility on account anomalies inside the individual resources.

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40045).

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives. 

High quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources. 

Azure Security Center provides high quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation. 

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40046).

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40047).

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity. 

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40048).

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks. 
Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.

**Guidance**: Establish an Azure identity and privileged access approaches as part of your organization’s overall security access control strategy.  

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	A centralized identity and authentication system and its interconnectivity with other internal and external identity systems

-	Strong authentication methods in different use cases and conditions

-	Protection of highly privileged users

-	Anomaly user activities monitoring and handling  

-	User identity and access review and reconciliation process

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40076).

**Guidance**: Establish a logging and threat response strategy to rapidly detect and remediate threats while meeting compliance requirements. Prioritize providing analysts with high quality alerts and seamless experiences so that they can focus on threats rather than integration and manual steps. 

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	The security operations (SecOps) organization’s role and responsibilities 

-	A well-defined incident response process aligning with NIST or another industry framework 

-	Log capture and retention to support threat detection, incident response, and compliance needs

-	Centralized visibility of and correlation information about threats, using SIEM, native Azure capabilities, and other sources 

-	Communication and notification plan with your customers, suppliers, and public parties of interest

-	Use of Azure native and third-party platforms for incident handling, such as logging and threat detection, forensics, and attack remediation and eradication

-	Processes for handling incidents and post-incident activities, such as lessons learned and evidence retention
