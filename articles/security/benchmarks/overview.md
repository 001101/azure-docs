# Overview

The Azure Security Controls Benchmark contains recommendations that help you improve the security of your applications and data on Azure.

Azure Security Controls benchmark includes cloud-centric control areas. These controls are consistent with well-known security benchmarks, such as those described by the [Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) Version 7.

The following numbered control areas are used in the Azure Security Controls Benchmark: 

- [Network security](security-control-network-security.md) 
- [Logging & Monitoring](security-control-logging-and-monitoring.md) 
- [Identity and Access Control](security-control-identity-and-access-control.md)
- [Data protection](security-control-data-protection.md)
- [Vulnerability Management](security-control-vulnerability-management.md)
- [Inventory & Asset Management](security-control-inventory-and-asset-management.md)
- [Secure Configuration](security-control-secure-configuration.md)
- [Malware Defense](security-control-malware-defense.md)
- [Data Recovery](security-control-data-recovery.md)
- [Incident Response](security-control-incident-response.md)
- [Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises](security-control-penetration-tests-and-red-team-exercises.md)

## Azure Security Controls Security Recommendations 

The Azure Security Controls Benchmark contains recommendations for networking, logging, monitoring, identity and access management, data protection, and other security controls.

Each recommendation includes the following information: 

- **Recommendation**: The action or task for implementation. For example, Azure recommends, within the Network Security section, to “Ensure that only network ports, protocols and services listening on a system with validated business needs, are running on each service”. 
- **Azure ID**: The Azure Security Controls Benchmark ID that corresponds to the recommendation. 
- **CIS ID**: The CIS sub-control ID that corresponds to this recommendation.  
- **Responsibility**: Whether the customer or the service-provider is responsible for implementing this recommendation. Security responsibilities are shared in the public cloud. Some security controls are only available to the cloud service provider and therefore responsibility for addressing those controls falls on Microsoft Azure.  
- **Details**: How to implement the recommendation on Azure, plus links to documentation for more information.
