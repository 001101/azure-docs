# Security controls for Azure services

This article aggregates the security controls for selected Azure services. 

[!INCLUDE [Security controls Header](../../../includes/security-controls-header.md)]

Security controls are categorized as:

* Network
* Monitoring & logging
* Identity
* Data protection
* Configuration management

Some services may specify "Additional security controls".

In each category, we show "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether an attribute is used. For some services, we show "N/A" for an attribute that is not applicable. We might also provide a note or a link to more information about an attribute.
