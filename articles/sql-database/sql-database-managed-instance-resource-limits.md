# Overview Azure SQL Database Managed Instance resource limits

This article provides an overview of the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance resource limits and provides information how to create request to increase default subscription limits. 

> [!NOTE]
> For other Managed Instance limitations, not specific to individual subscription, see [vCore-based purchasing model](sql-database-managed-instance.md#vcore-based-purchasing-mode)) and [Managed Instance service tiers](sql-database-managed-instance.md#managed-instance-service-tiers).

## Default subscription limits per region

Managed Instance only supports deployment on the following types of subscriptions:

- Enterprise Agreement (EA)
- Pay-as-you-go
- Cload Service Provider (CSP)

Managed Instances has two default subscription-level limits per Azure region. Different subscription types have different regional limits. These limits can be increased by creating special support request in the Azure portal for the subscription with issue type **Quota**:

- **Subnet limit**: The maximum number of subnets where managed instances are deployed
- **Instance number limit**: The maximum number of instances per region

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When planning your deployments, consider that a Business Critical (BC) instance (due to added redundancy) generally consumes 4x more capacity than a General Purpose (GP) instance. To simplify your consumption analysis against the default limits, summarize the instance units across all subnets in the region where Managed Instances are deployed and compare the results with the instance unit limits for your subscription type.

## Default limits by subscription type

|Subscription type| Max number of Managed Instance subnets | Max number of instances |Max number of GP managed instances*|Max number of BC managed instances*|
| :---| :--- | :--- |:--- |:--- |
|Pay-as-you-go|1*|4*|4*|1*|
|CSP |1*|4*|4*|1*|
|EA|3**|12**|12**|3**|

/* You can either deploy 1 BC or 4 GP instances in one subnet, so that total number of “instance units” in a region never exceeds  4.  
/*/* Maximum number of instances in one service tier applies if there are no instances in another service tier. In case you plan to mix GP and instances within same subnet, use the following section as a reference for allowed combinations. As a simple rule: by default total number of subnets cannon exceed 3, while total number of “instance units” cannot exceed 12. 

## Deployment options for GP and BC deployments within the same subnet 
The following examples cover non-trivial deployment cases with non-empty subnets. 
Number of subnets: 1 

Subnet 1 
0 BC and up to 12 GP 
1 BC and up to 8 GP, or 
2 BC and up to 4 GP 
3 BC 
 
Number of subnets: 2  

Subnet 1 
Subnet 2 
0 BC, up to 4 GP 
0 BC, up to 8 GP 
1 BC, up to 4 GP 
2 BC 
1 BC 
0 BC, up to 8 GP 
1 BC, up to 4 GP 
2 BC 
2 BC 
0 BC, up to 8 GP 
1 BC, up to 4 GP 
2 BC 
 
Number of subnets: 3 

Subnet 1 
Subnet 2  
Subnet 3 
1BC, 0 GP 
1BC, 0 GP 
0 BC, up to 4 GP 
1BC, 0 GP 
0 BC, up to 4 GP 
1BC, 0 GP 
0 BC, up to 4 GP 
1BC, 0 GP 
1BC, 0 GP 
 
 
How to obtain larger quotas for SQL Managed Instance? 
To initiate process, submit a new support request in the Azure portal for the subscription with issue type “Quota”.  Open “Help + support” blade in Azure Portal and click “New support request”: 
 
 

Page Break
 
Specify Issue Type "Service and subscription limits (quota)" and Quota type = "SQL Database Managed Instance" 
 
 
Provide Severity and quota details in the Problem pane. A valid request should include: 
Region in which limit needs to be changed 
Required number of instances, per service tier in existing subnets  after quota increase  (if any of the existing subnet needs to be expanded). 
Required number of new subnets and total number of instances per service tier within the new subnets (if you need to deploy managed instances in new subnets). 
 
 
 
 
In the last step (“Contact information”) enter preferred contact method (email, phone), contact details and create request.
