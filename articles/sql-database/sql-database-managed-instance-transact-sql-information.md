# Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server 
Azure SQL Database Managed Instance provides high compatibility with SQL Server on-premises. Most of the SQL Server features are supported in Managed Instance. Since there are still some differences in syntax, in this article are summarized and explained differences. 

## Auditing 
 
SQL Audit work on server level and stores `.xel` files on Azure Blob Storage account. The key differences between Auditing in Managed Instance, Azure SQL Database, and SQL Server on-premises are: 
- On Azure DB, SQL Audit works on database level  
- On on-premises, SQL Audit works at server level, but stores events on files system/windows event logs  
  
XEvent Auditing supports Azure blob storage targets. File and windows logs are not supported.    
 
The key differences in CREATE AUDIT syntax for Auditing to Azure `BLOB_STORAGE` are:
- New syntax `TO URL` is provided and enables you to specify URL of the Azure blob Storage container where `.xel` files will be placed 
- Syntax `TO FILE` is not supported because Managed instance cannot access Windows file shares. 
 
See more information in:  
- [CREATE SERVER AUDIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-server-audit-transact-sql)  
- [ALTER SERVER AUDIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-server-audit-transact-sql) 
- See [Auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-database-engine)     
 
## Backup 
 Azure SQL Database Managed Instance has automatic backups, and enables user to create 
- Only full database `COPY_ONLY` backups are supported. Differential, log, and FILE_SNAPSHOT backups are not supported.  
- Backup targetTarget: 
 - Only `BACKUP TO URL` is supported 
 - `FILE`, `TAPE`, and backup devices are not supported  
- `WITH` <options>  
 - `COPY_ONLY` is mandatory  
 - Most of the general `WITH` <options> are supported 
 - `COPY_ONLY` is mandatory  
 
 - `FILE_SNAPSHOT` not supported  
 - Tape options: `REWIND`, `NOREWIND`, `UNLOAD`, and `NOUNLOAD` are not supported 
 - Log-specific options: `NORECOVERY`, `STANDBY`, and `NO_TRUNCATE` are not supported 
 
Limitations:  
- Max stripe size is 195GB (PAGE blob size). Increase number of stripes in backup command to distribute stripe sizes. 

> To work around this limitation on premises, you can backup to `DISK` instead of backup to `URL`, upload backup file to blob, then restore. Restore support bigger files because a different blob types is used.  

- Managed Instance works with up to 32 stripes, which is enough for database up to 4TB.
 
## Buffer pool extension 
 
Buffer pool extension - not supported 
 
## Bulk insert / openrowset 
Managed Instance cannot access file shares and Windows folders, so the files must be imported from Azure Blob Storage.
 
## Certificates 
Managed Instance cannot access file shares and Windows folders, so the following constraint apply: 
- `CREATE`/`BACKUP` `FROM`/`TO` files is not supported for certificates  
- `CREATE`/`BACKUP` certificate from `FILE`/`ASSEMBLY` is not supported. Private key files cannot be used.  
 
See [CREATE CERTIFICATE (Transact-SQL) ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-certificate-transact-sql) and [BACKUP CERTIFICATE (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/backup-certificate-transact-sql)  
  
> Workaround: script certificate/private key, store as .sql file and create from binary: 
 
``` 
CREATE CERTIFICATE  
 FROM BINARY = asn_encoded_certificate    
WITH PRIVATE KEY ( <private_key_options> ) 
```   
 
## CLR 
Managed Instance cannot access file shares and Windows folders, so the following constraint apply: 
- Only `CREATE ASSEMBLY FROM BINARY` is supported. See [CREATE ASSEMBLY](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql) FROM BINARY 
- `CREATE ASSEMBLY FROM FILE` is not supported. See [CREATE ASSEMBLY](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-assembly-transact-sql) FROM FILE 
- [ALTER ASSEMBLY](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-assembly-transact-sql) cannot reference files. 
 
## Compatibility levels 
 
- Supported compatibility levels are: 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150  
- Compatibility levels below 100 are not supported. 
- The default compatibility level is 140. 
 
## Credential 
 
Only Azure Key vault and `SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE` identities are supported. Windows users are not supported 
 
See [CREATE CREDENTIAL](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-credential-transact-sql) and [ALTER CREDENTIAL](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-credential-transact-sql)  
 
## Collation 
 
Server collation is always `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`  
 
## Database options 
 
- Multiple log files are not supported. 
- In-memory objects are not supported  
- There is a limit 280 files per instance implying max 280 files per database.  
- Every database has one FILEGROUP called XTP that contains memory optimized data. If original database backup didn't have memory optimized file group, it will be added during restore. 
- Cannot create general purpose database with objects in XTP filegroups (Memory-optimized tables, natively compiled stored procedures)  
- Database cannot contain file groups containing file stream data are not supported.  Restore will fail if .bak contains `FILESTREAM` data.  
- Every file is placed on separate Azure Premium Disk. IO and throughput depend on the size of each individual file. See [Azure Premium disk performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/premium-storage-performance#premium-storage-disk-sizes)  
 
### CREATE DATABASE 
The following are `CREATE DATABASE` limitations:

 > As workaround, use `ALTER DATABASE` after `CREATE DATABASE` to set database options, or to add files, or to set containment.  

### ALTER DATABASE 
- Use `ALTER DATABASE` after `CREATE DATABASE` to set database options or to add files  
- File path cannot be specified in `ALTER DATABASE ADD FILE (FILENAME='path')` T-SQL statement. Remove `FILENAME` from the script because Managed Instance places the files.  
The following options are set by default and cannot be changed: 
- `MULTI_USER` 
- `ENABLE_BROKER ON` 
- `AUTO_CLOSE OFF` 
 
The following options are not supported:
