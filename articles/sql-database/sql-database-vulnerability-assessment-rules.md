# SQL Vulnerability Assessment rules reference guide

This article lists the set of built-in rules that are used to flag security vulnerabilities and highlight deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data. The rules are based on Microsoftâ€™s best practices and focus on the security issues that present the biggest risks to your database and its valuable data. They cover both database-level issues as well as server-level security issues, like server firewall settings and server-level permissions. These rules also represent many of the requirements from various regulatory bodies to meet their compliance standards.

The rules shown in your database scans depend on the SQL version and platform that was scanned. 

To learn about how to implement Vulnerability Assessment on SQL Databases see [Implement Vulnerability Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment#implementing-vulnerability-assessment).
