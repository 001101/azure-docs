# Tutorial: Deploy a predictive model in R with Azure SQL Database Machine Learning Services (preview)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a predictive model in R with Azure SQL Database Machine Learning Services (preview).

Azure SQL Database Machine Learning Services enables you to train and test predictive models in the context of an Azure SQL database. First, you store the model in an Azure SQL database. Then, you create a stored procedure with an embedded R script that makes predictions using the model. The database engine takes care of the execution. Because it executes in the SQL database, your models can easily be trained against data stored in the database.

This tutorial is **part three of a three-part tutorial series**.

In part three, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Store the predictive model in a database table
> * Create a stored procedure that generates the model
> * Create a stored procedure that makes predictions using the model
> * Execute the model with new data

In [part one](sql-database-tutorial-build-deploy-model-1.md), you learned how how to import a sample database into an Azure SQL database, and then prepare the data to be used for training a predictive model in R.

In [part two](sql-database-tutorial-build-deploy-model-2.md), you learned how to create and train multiple models, and then choose the most accurate one.

[!INCLUDE[ml-preview-note](../../includes/sql-database-ml-preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Part three of this tutorial series assumes you have completed [part one](sql-database-tutorial-build-deploy-model-1.md) and [part two](sql-database-tutorial-build-deploy-model-2.md).

## Store the model in a database table

Run the following commands in Azure Data Studio or SSMS.

1. Create a table for storing the model.

    ```sql
    USE TutorialDB;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rental_rx_models;
    GO
    CREATE TABLE rental_rx_models (
          model_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT('default model') PRIMARY KEY
        , model VARBINARY(MAX) NOT NULL
        );
    GO
    ```

1. Save the model to a table as a binary object.

    ```sql
    -- Save model to table
    TRUNCATE TABLE rental_rx_models;
    
    DECLARE @model VARBINARY(MAX);
    
    EXECUTE generate_rental_rx_model @model OUTPUT;
    
    INSERT INTO rental_rx_models (
          model_name
        , model
        )
    VALUES (
         'rxDTree'
        , @model
        );
    
    SELECT *
    FROM rental_rx_models;
    ```

## Create a stored procedure that generates the model

In [part two](sql-database-tutorial-build-deploy-model-2.md#compare-the-results) of this tutorial series, you decided that a decision tree (dtree) model was the most accurate. Now create a stored procedure that trains and generates the dtree model.

```sql
-- Stored procedure that trains and generates an R model using the rental_data and a decision tree algorithm
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS generate_rental_rx_model;
GO
CREATE PROCEDURE generate_rental_rx_model (@trained_model VARBINARY(max) OUTPUT)
AS
BEGIN
    EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
        , @script = N'
require("RevoScaleR");

rental_train_data$Holiday <- factor(rental_train_data$Holiday);
rental_train_data$Snow    <- factor(rental_train_data$Snow);
rental_train_data$WeekDay <- factor(rental_train_data$WeekDay);

#Create a dtree model and train it using the training data set
model_dtree <- rxDTree(RentalCount ~ Month + Day + WeekDay + Snow + Holiday, data = rental_train_data);
#Serialize the model before saving it to the database table
trained_model <- as.raw(serialize(model_dtree, connection=NULL));
'
        , @input_data_1 = N'
            SELECT RentalCount
                 , Year
                 , Month
                 , Day
                 , WeekDay
                 , Snow
                 , Holiday
            FROM dbo.rental_data
            WHERE Year < 2015
            '
        , @input_data_1_name = N'rental_train_data'
        , @params = N'@trained_model varbinary(max) OUTPUT'
        , @trained_model = @trained_model OUTPUT;
END;
GO
```

## Create a stored procedure that makes predictions

Create a stored procedure (`predict_rentalcount_new`) that makes predictions using the model.

```sql
-- Stored procedure that takes model name and new data as input parameters and predicts the rental count for the new data
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS predict_rentalcount_new;
GO
CREATE PROCEDURE predict_rentalcount_new (
      @model_name VARCHAR(100)
    , @input_query NVARCHAR(MAX)
    )
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @rx_model VARBINARY(MAX) = (
            SELECT model
            FROM rental_rx_models
            WHERE model_name = @model_name
            );

    EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
        , @script = N'
require("RevoScaleR");

#Convert types to factors
rentals$Holiday <- factor(rentals$Holiday);
rentals$Snow    <- factor(rentals$Snow);
rentals$WeekDay <- factor(rentals$WeekDay);

#Before using the model to predict, we need to unserialize it
rental_model <- unserialize(rx_model);

#Call prediction function
rental_predictions <- rxPredict(rental_model, rentals);
'
        , @input_data_1 = @input_query
        , @input_data_1_name = N'rentals'
        , @output_data_1_name = N'rental_predictions'
        , @params = N'@rx_model varbinary(max)'
        , @rx_model = @rx_model
    WITH RESULT SETS(("RentalCount_Predicted" FLOAT));
END;
GO
```

## Execute the model with new data

Now you can use the stored procedure `predict_rentalcount_new` to predict the rental count from new data.

```sql
-- Execute the predict_rentalcount_new stored procedure and pass the model name and a query string with a set of features to use to predict the rental count
EXECUTE dbo.predict_rentalcount_new @model_name = 'rxDTree'
    , @input_query = '
        SELECT CONVERT(INT,  3) AS Month
             , CONVERT(INT, 24) AS Day
             , CONVERT(INT,  4) AS WeekDay
             , CONVERT(INT,  1) AS Snow
             , CONVERT(INT,  1) AS Holiday
        ';
GO
```

You should see a result similar to the following.

```results
RentalCount_Predicted
332.571428571429
```

You have successfully created, trained, and deployed a model in an Azure SQL database. You then used that model in a stored procedure to predict values based on new data.

## Next Steps

* Store the predictive model in a database table
