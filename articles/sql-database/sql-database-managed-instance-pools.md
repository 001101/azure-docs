# What are SQL Database managed instance pools (preview)?

Instance pools are a new resource in Azure SQL Database that provides a convenient and cost-efficient way to migrate smaller SQL instances to the cloud at scale.

Previously, to migrate to the cloud, smaller, less compute-intensive workloads would often have to be consolidated on a larger managed instance. If you planned to migrate a group of databases hosted on multiple small-size SQL Servers on-premises (for example 2 vCores), you would need to deploy them together (consolidate) on the same managed instance of a larger size (8 vCores, for example). That typically required careful capacity planning and resource governance, additional security considerations and some extra data consolidation work at the instance level.

Managed instance pools bypass this by allowing you to *pre-provision compute* according to your total migration requirements (for example 8 vCores), then enabling you to deploy several individual managed instances up to your pre-provisioned compute level (two 2-vCore and one 4-vCore instances) and migrate databases these instances without any consolidation. The ability to deploy 2 vCore managed instance is now available only within instance pools.

Instance pools support native VNet integration. Depending on your requirements, you can deploy multiple instance pools and multiple single instances in the same subnet.

The [service tier property](sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits.md#service-tier-characteristics) (General Purpose or Business Critical) is associated with the instance pool resource so all deployed instances in a pool must be the same service tier as the service tier of the pool.

## Key capabilities of instance pools

Instance pools provide the following benefits:

1. Ability to host 2 vCore instances.
2. Predictable and fast instance deployment time (up to 5 minutes).
3. Minimal IP address allocation.

The following diagram illustrates an instance pool with multiple instances deployed within a VNet subnet.

![instance pool with multiple instances](./media/sql-database-managed-instance-pools/instance-pools1.png)

Instance pools enable deployment of multiple instances on the same virtual machine. The virtual machine's compute size is based on the total number of vCores allocated for the pool. This architecture allows *partitioning* of the virtual machine into multiple instances, which can be any supported size, including 2 vCores (2 vCore instances are only available for instances in pools).

Additionally, deployment or extension of a [virtual cluster](https://sql-database-managed-instance-connectivity-architecture.md#high-level-connectivity-architecture)
(dedicated set of virtual machines) is not part of provisioning the managed instance but happens when the managed instance is provisioned. Because of this, management operations on instances in a pool are much faster after the pool is initially deployed.

Since all instances in a pool share the same virtual machine, total IP allocation does not depend on the number of instances deployed, which is convenient for deployment in subnets with a narrow IP range.

Every pool has a fixed IP allocation of only nine IP addresses (this does not include the five IP addresses in the subnet reserved for its own needs).

For details, see [subnet size requirements for single instances](sql-database-managed-instance-determine-size-vnet-subnet.md).

## Application scenarios for instance pools

These are the main use cases where instance pools should be considered:

- Migration of *a group of SQL instances* at the same time, where the majority is a smaller size (for example 2 or 4 vCores).

- Scenarios where *predictable and short instance creation or scaling* is important. For example, deployment of a new tenant in a multi-tenant SaaS application environment that requires instance-level surface area.

- Scenarios when having *fixed cost* or *spending limit* is important. For example, running shared dev-test or demo environments of a fixed (or infrequently changing) size, where you periodically deploy managed instances when needed.

- Scenarios where *minimal IP address allocation* in a VNet subnet is important. All instances in a pool are sharing a virtual machine, so the number of allocated IP addresses is lower than in the case of single instances.

## How to deploy managed instances in pools

Process of instance deployment within a pool consists of two separate steps:

1. One-off instance pool deployment. This is a long running operation, with the duration same as for [first instance creation in an empty subnet](sql-database-managed-instance.md#managed-instance-management-operations).

2. Repetitive instance deployment within the pool, created in the first step. Instance pool parameter must be explicitly specified as part of this operation. This is relatively fast operation that typically takes up to 5 minutes.

In public preview, both steps are supported through PowerShell and Resource Manager templates only. The Azure portal experience should be coming soon.

After a managed instance is deployed in a pool, you *can* use the Azure portal to change its properties on the Pricing tier page.

For detailed steps explaining how to create a pool and instances, check out [Getting started with managed instance pools](#getting-started-with-instance-pools).

## Instance pool billing

Instance pools allow scaling compute and storage independently. Customers pay for compute associated with the pool resource and measured in vCores, and storage associated with every instance and measured in gigabytes (the first 32 GB are free of charge for every instance).

vCore price for a pool is charged regardless of how many instances are deployed in that pool.

For the Compute price (measured in vCores), two pricing options are available:

1. *License included*: Apply existing SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance.

2. *Azure Hybrid Benefit*: A reduced price that includes Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server. Customers can opt into this price by using their existing SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance. For eligibility and other details, see [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/)

Choosing between these two pricing options is not possible at the level of individual instances. All instances in the parent pool must be either at License Included price or Azure Hybrid Benefit price. The license model for the pool can be altered after the pool is created.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you specify a License Model for the instance that is different than in the pool, the pool price is used and the instance level value is ignored.

If you create instance pools on [subscriptions eligible for dev-test benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/dev-test/), you automatically receive discounted rates of up to 55 percent on Azure SQL managed instance.

For full details on instance pools pricing, refer to the *instance pools* section on the [managed instance pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/managed/).

## Architecture of instance pools

Instance pools have similar architecture to regular managed instances ("single instances"). To support [deployments within Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services.md#deploy-azure-services-into-virtual-networks) and provide isolation and security for customers, instance pools also rely on [virtual
clusters](sql-database-managed-instance-connectivity-architecture.md#high-level-connectivity-architecture), which represents a dedicated set of isolated virtual machines deployed inside the customer's virtual network subnet.

The main difference between the two deployment models is that instance pools allow multiple SQL Server process deployments on the same virtual machine node, which are resource governed using [Windows Job
Objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ProcThread/job-objects), while single instances are always alone on a virtual machine node.

The following diagram shows instance pool and two individual instances deployed in the same subnet and illustrates main architectural details for both deployment models:

![instance pool and two individual instances](./media/sql-database-managed-instance-pools/instance-pools2.png)

Every instance pool creates a separate virtual cluster underneath. Instances within a pool and single instances deployed in the same subnet do not share compute resources allocated to SQL Server processes and gateway components that ensures performance predictability.

## Instance pools resource limitations

There are several resource limitations regarding instance pools and instances inside pools:

- Instance pools are available only on Gen5 hardware.
- Instances within the pool have dedicated CPU and RAM memory so the aggregated number of vCores across all instances must be less or equal to the number of vCores allocated to the pool.
- All [instance level limits](sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits.md#service-tier-characteristics) apply to instances created within a pool.
- In addition to instance-level limits there are also two limits imposed *at the instance pool level*:
  - Total storage size per pool (8 TB).
  - Total number of databases per pool (100).

Total storage allocation and number of databases across all instances must be lower or equal to the limits exposed by instance pools.

- Instance pools support 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 64, and 80 vCores.
- Managed instances inside pools support 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 64 and 80 vCores.
- Managed instances inside pools support storage sizes between 32 GB and 8 TB, except:
  - 2 vCore instances support sizes between 32 GB and 640 GB
  - 4 vCore instances support sizes between 32 GB and 2 TB


## Public preview limitations

The public preview has the following limitations:

- Only the General Purpose service tier is available at this time. Business Critical service tier is planned to be added at GA time.

- Instance pools cannot be scaled during the public preview so careful capacity planning before deployment is important.

- No Azure portal support for instance pool creation and configuration exists at this time. All operations on instance pools are supported through PowerShell only. Initial instance deployment in a pre-created pool is also supported through PowerShell only. Once deployed in a pool, managed instances can be update using Azure portal.

- Managed instances created outside of the pool cannot be moved to an existing pool and vice versa, instances created inside pool cannot be moved outside as standalone managed instances or to another pool.
- Reserved instance price (license included or with Azure Hybrid Benefit) is not available.

## SQL features supported

Instances created in pools support the same [compatibility levels and features supported in a single managed instance](sql-database-managed-instance.md#sql-features-supported).

Every managed instance deployed in a pool has a separate instance of SQL Agent.

Optional features or features that require you to choose specific values (such as instance-level collation, time zone, public endpoint for data traffic, failover groups) are configured at instance level and can be different for every instance in the pool.

## Performance considerations

Although managed instances within pools do have dedicated vCore and RAM memory, they share local disk (for tempdb usage) and network resources. Although not very much likely, it is possible to experience the *noisy neighbor* effect if multiple instances in the pool have high resource consumption at the same time. If you observe this behavior, consider deploying these instances in a bigger pool or as single instances.

## Security considerations

Because instances deployed in a pool share the same virtual machine, you may want to consider disabling features that introduce higher security risks, or to firmly control access permissions to these features. For example, CLR integration, native backup and restore, database email, etc.

## Getting started with instance pools

Instance pool operations are supported in PowerShell.

List of available [PowerShell commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/)


|Cmdlet |Description |
|:---|:---|
|New-AzSqlInstancePool | Creates an Azure SQL Database managed instance pool. |
|Get-AzSqlInstancePool | Returns information about Azure SQL managed instance pool. |
|Set-AzSqlInstancePool | Sets properties for an Azure SQL Database managed instance pool. |
|Remove-AzSqlInstancePool | Removes an Azure SQL Database managed instance pool. |
|Get-AzSqlInstancePoolUsage | Returns information about Azure SQL managed instance pool usage. |


To use PowerShell, make sure you [install the latest version of PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell#powershell-core).

Then follow instructions to [Install Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

For operations related to the managed instance inside pools, the standard [managed instance commands](sql-database-managed-instance-create-manage.md#powershell-create-and-manage-managed-instances) can be used. When using these commands for an instance in a pool, the instance pool name property must be populated.

### Examples

#### Create an instance pool

Step 1: Create new virtual network and subnet using [Azure portal template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-create-vnet-subnet) or use instructions for [preparing an existing virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-configure-vnet-subnet)

Step 2: Execute command for creating new instance pool

```powershell
$instancePool = New-AzSqlInstancePool -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -Name "mi-pool-name" -SubnetId "your-subnet-id" -LicenseType "BasePrice" -VCore 80 -Edition "GeneralPurpose" -ComputeGeneration "Gen5" -Location "westeurope"
```


### Create managed instance inside pool

```powershell
$instance = $instancePool | New-AzSqlInstance -Name "pool-mi-001" -VCore 2 -StorageSizeInGB 512
```

### Get pool usage with belonging managed instances details

```powershell
$myPool | Get-AzSqlInstancePoolUsage --ExpandChildren
```

### Update storage of managed instance placed inside the pool

```powershell
$instance | Set-AzSqlInstance -StorageSizeInGB 1024 -InstancePoolName "mi-pool-name"
```

### Get list of databases from managed instance

```powershell
$databases = Get-AzSqlInstanceDatabase -InstanceName "pool-mi-001" -ResourceGroupName " resource-group-name "
```

## How-to guide

This how-to section walks you through basic scenarios available in instance pools during public preview. While just a couple of operations will be available through Azure portal experience in public preview, PowerShell will cover all of them. 

The following table shows the available commands related to managed instance and managed instance pools and their availability in the Azure portal and PowerShell.


|Command|Azure Portal|PowerShell|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Create managed instance pool|No|Yes|
|Update managed instance pool (limited number of properties)|No |Yes |
|Check managed instance pool usage and properties|No|Yes |
|Delete managed instance pool|No|Yes|
|Create managed instance inside managed instance pool|No|Yes|
|Update managed instance resource usage|Yes |Yes|
|Check managed instance usage and properties|Yes|Yes|
|Delete managed instance from the pool|Yes|Yes|
|Create a database in managed instance placed in the pool|Yes|Yes|
|Delete a database from managed instance|Yes|Yes|

### Create managed instance pool 
 
Resources required and steps for creating managed instance pool include:

1. Virtual Network with subnet.
2. Preparing Virtual Network and subnet for an instance pool.
3. Creating an instance pool inside prepared Virtual Network and subnet.

### Create Virtual Network with subnet 
 
If you consider placing multiple instance pools inside the same Virtual Network, please refer to following articles:

- [Determine VNet subnet size for Azure SQL Database managed instance](sql-database-managed-instance-determine-size-vnet-subnet.md)
- [Create a virtual network for an Azure SQL Database managed instance](sql-database-managed-instance-create-vnet-subnet.md)

This step can be achieved either using the Azure portal or PowerShell. 

Example of PowerShell command that can be used (change the names of the virtual network and subnet, and adjust the IP ranges associated with your networking resources):

```powershell
$virtualNetwork = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location EastUS `
  -Name miPoolVirtualNetwork`
  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16
```

After creating Virtual Network add a subnet inside it:

```powershell
$subnetConfig = Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
  -Name miPoolSubnet`
  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24 `
  -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork
```

### Preparing Virtual Network and subnet for managed instance 
 
Managed instance pools must be deployed within an Azure virtual network and the subnet dedicated for managed instances pools only. The same guidelines are applied for managed instance and managed instances pools [](sql-database-managed-instance-configure-vnet-subnet.md)

For preparing Virtual Network and Subnet execute the following command with your subscription id, and names for resource group, virtual network, and subnet used in the previous step.


```powershell
$scriptUrlBase = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/master/samples/manage/azure-sql-db-managed-instance/prepare-subnet'
  
$parameters = @{
    subscriptionId = '<subscriptionId>'
    resourceGroupName = '<resourceGroupName>'
    virtualNetworkName = '<virtualNetworkName>'
    subnetName = '<subnetName>'
    }

Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([Scriptblock]::Create((iwr ($scriptUrlBase+'/prepareSubnet.ps1?t='+ [DateTime]::Now.Ticks)).Content)) -ArgumentList $parameters
```

### Create a managed instance inside prepared Virtual Network and Subnet 
 
After completing previous steps, you are ready to create managed instance pools.

Several restrictions to follow:

- Only General Purpose and Gen5 are available in public preview.
- Pool name can contain only lowercase, numbers and hyphen, and can't start with a hyphen.
- In order to get subnet ID, use `Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "miPoolSubnet" -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork`.
- If you want to use AHB (Azure Hybrid Benefit), it is applied on instance pool level. You can set the license type during pool creation or update it anytime after creation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deploying an instance pool is a long running operation that takes approximately 4.5 hours.

To create an instance pool:

```powershell
$instancePool = New-AzSqlInstancePool `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Name "mi-pool-name" `
  -SubnetId "/subscriptions/a8c9a924-06c0-4bde-9788-e7b1370969e1/resourceGroups/ myResourceGroup /providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/ miPoolVirtualNetwork /subnets/ miPoolSubnet" `
  -LicenseType "LicenceIncluded" `
  -VCore 80 `
  -Edition "GeneralPurpose" `
  -ComputeGeneration "Gen5" `
  -Location "westeurope"
```


Because deploying an instance pool is a long running operation, you need to wait until it completes before running any of the following steps. 

### Create managed instance inside the pool 

After the successful deployment of the instance pool, it's time to create first instance inside it. For creating a managed instance execute the following:
```powershell
$instanceOne = $instancePool | New-AzSqlInstance -Name "poolmi-001" -VCore 2 -StorageSizeInGB 256
```

Deploying instance inside the pool is an operation that takes a couple of minutes. After the first instance has been created, we can create the second one:
```powershell
$instanceTwo = $instancePool | New-AzSqlInstance -Name "poolmi-001" -VCore 4 -StorageSizeInGB 512
```

### Check managed instance pool usage 
 
To get a list of instances inside a pool:

```powershell
$instancePool | Get-AzSqlInstance
```


To get pool resource usage:

```powershell
$instancePool | Get-AzSqlInstancePoolUsage
```


For a detailed usage overview of the pool and instances inside it execute

```powershell
$instancePool | Get-AzSqlInstancePoolUsage –ExpandChildren
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100 databases per pool (not per instance).

### Create a database inside instance 

For creating a database and managing databases that in managed instance placed inside the pool, same set of commands like for singleton managed instance is used.

To create a database inside a managed instance:

```powershell
$poolinstancedb = New-AzSqlInstanceDatabase -Name "mipooldb1" -InstanceName "poolmi-001" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
```


### Scale managed instance inside the pool 


After populating managed instance with databases and start with test or production, you may hit instance limits regarding storage of performance. In that case, if pool usage has not exceeded, you are able to scale your instance. 

Example of command for scaling number of vCores and storage size


```powershell
$instanceOne | Set-AzSqlInstance -VCore 8 -StorageSizeInGB 512  -InstancePoolName "mi-pool-name"
```


Scaling managed instance inside pool is an operation that takes a couple of minutes. Prerequisite for scaling is available vCores and storage on the instance pool level. 


### Connect to managed instance placed inside the pool

Two steps are required for achieving this:

1. Enabling public endpoint for the instance.
2. Adding inbound rule to network security group.

After both steps are completed, you can connect to the instance by using public endpoint address, port and credentials provided during instance creation. 

Enabling public endpoint for instance

This can be done through portal or using the following PowerShell command:


```powershell
$instanceOne | Set-AzSqlInstance -PublicDataEndpointEnabled true
```

This parameter can be set during instance creation as well.

### Add an inbound rule to NSG 
 
This step can also be achieve through portal or using PowerShell commands:


```powershell
$RGname="myResourceGroup" 
$port=3342 
$rulename="public_endpoint_inbound" 
$nsgname="nsg-mi-pool-name"
```

### Get the NSG resource


```powershell
$resource = Get-AzResource | Where {$_.ResourceGroupName –eq $RGname -and $_.ResourceType -eq "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups"}
$nsg = Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name $nsgname -ResourceGroupName $RGname
```


### Add the inbound security rule


```powershell
$nsg | Add-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name $rulename -Description "Allow app port" -Access Allow `
    -Protocol * -Direction Inbound -Priority 1300 -SourceAddressPrefix "*" -SourcePortRange * `
    -DestinationAddressPrefix * -DestinationPortRange $port
```


### Update the NSG


```powershell
$nsg | Set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup
```

> [!NOTE]
> Adding inbound rule can be done at any time after the subnet is prepared for managed instance as described previously in this article.
