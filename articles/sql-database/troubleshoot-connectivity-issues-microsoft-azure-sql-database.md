# Troubleshooting connectivity issues with Microsoft Azure SQL Database

You receive error messages when the connection to Azure SQL Database fails. The connection problems can be caused by SQL Azure database reconfiguration, firewall settings, connection time-out, or incorrect login information. Additionally, if the maximum limit on some Azure SQL Database resources is reached, you cannot connect to Azure SQL Database.

## A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server

The issue occurs because the application is not able to connect to the server.

To resolve this issue, try the following steps (in that order):

1. Make sure that TCP IP is enabled as a client protocol on the application server. For more information, see [Configure client protocols](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181035.aspx). On application servers where you do not have SQL Server tools installed, check that TCP IP is enabled by running cliconfg.exe (SQL Server Client Network Utility). 
2. Check the application’s connection string to make sure that it is correctly configured. For example, make sure that the connection string specifies the correct port (1433) and the fully qualified server name.
See [Obtain the connection string from the Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-connectivity-issues/#connections-to-azure-sql-database).
3. Try increasing the connection **timeout**. Microsoft recommends using a connection timeout of at least 30 seconds. 
4. Test the connectivity between the application server and the Azure SQL database by using a UDL file, ping, and telnet. For more information, see [Troubleshooting SQL Server connectivity issues](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chaitanya_medikonduri/archive/2011/03/09/sql-server-connectivity-issues-troubleshooting-tips.aspx) and [Diagnostics for connectivity issues](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-connectivity-issues/#diagnostics).

   **Note**: As a troubleshooting step, you can also try to test the connectivity on a different client computer.
5. As a best practice, ensure retry logic is in place. For more information about the retry logic, see [Troubleshoot transient faults and connection errors to SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-connectivity-issues/).

If the previous steps do not resolve your problem, try the following step to collect more data and contact support:

* If your application is a cloud service, enable the logging. This step returns a UTC time stamp of the failure. Additionally, SQL Azure returns the tracing ID. [Microsoft Customer Support Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) can use this information. 

For more information about how to enable the logging, see [Enable diagnostics logging for web apps in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log/).

## Error 40613: Database < x > on server < y > is not currently available

**Detailed Error**

``40613: Database <DBname> on server <server name> is not currently available. Please retry the connection later. If the problem persists, contact customer support, and provide them the session tracing ID of '<Tracing ID>'.``

To solve this issue:

1. Check the [Microsoft Azure Service Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=168847) for any known outages. 
2. If there are no known outages go to the [Microsoft Azure Support website](http://azure.microsoft.com/support/options) to open a support case.

See [Troubleshoot "Database on server is not currently available" error](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-troubleshoot-connection/).

## Cannot connect to < servername > due to firewall issues

### Error 40615: Cannot connect to < servername >

To resolve this issue, [configure firewall settings on SQL Database using the Azure portal.](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-configure-firewall-settings/)

### Error 5: Cannot connect to < servername >

To solve this issue, make sure that port 1433 is open for outbound connections on all firewalls between the client and the Internet. Refer to [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc646023.aspx) for additional pointers.

## The server was not found or was not accessible (Errors 26, 40, 10053)

### Error 26: Error Locating Server/Instance Specified

**Detailed Error**

``System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections.(provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 26 – Error Locating Server/Instance Specified)``

The issue occurs because the application is not able to connect to the server.

To resolve this issue, try the following steps (in that order):

1. Make sure that TCP IP is enabled as a client protocol on the application server. For more information, see [Configure client protocols](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181035.aspx).

### Error 10053: A transport-level error has occurred when receiving results from the server.

**Detailed Error**

``10053: A transport-level error has occurred when receiving results from the server. (Provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine)``

**Note**: These error messages occur because of some system-specific issue such as an outage or some component failure. Therefore, you may eventually have to open a support case.

To find more information about these errors, try these methods:

1. Check the [Microsoft Azure Service Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=168847) for any known outages. 
2. Test the connectivity by using ping and telnet. For more information, see [Troubleshooting SQL Server connectivity issues](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chaitanya_medikonduri/archive/2011/03/09/sql-server-connectivity-issues-troubleshooting-tips.aspx) and [Diagnostics for connectivity issues](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-connectivity-issues/#diagnostics).

**Note** As a troubleshooting step, try to test the connectivity on a different client computer. Check whether you can log on by using SQL Server Management Studio and also the Azure portal:

* If you can log on, you can query the following DMVs in master database in order to understand the reason for the failure (Such as reconfiguration, idle connection threshold, and so on).

  ```
  SELECT * FROM sys.resource_stats 
  WHERE database_name='<Database name>' 
  SELECT * FROM sys.event_log 
  WHERE database_name='<Database name>'
  ```

If you cannot log on, follow **Unable to login to the server** and **Connections failing from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** scenarios.

## Socket was forcibly closed by remote host - Error 10053

**Note** These error messages occur because of some system-specific issue such as an outage or some component failure. Therefore, you may eventually have to open a support case.

To find more information about these errors, try these methods:

1. Check the [Microsoft Azure Service Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=168847) for any known outages. 
2. Test the connectivity by using ping and telnet. For more information, see [Troubleshooting SQL Server connectivity issues](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chaitanya_medikonduri/archive/2011/03/09/sql-server-connectivity-issues-troubleshooting-tips.aspx) and [Diagnostics for connectivity issues](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-connectivity-issues/#diagnostics). 

   **Note**: As a troubleshooting step, try to test the connectivity on a different client computer. Check whether you can log on by using SQL Server Management Studio and also the Azure portal:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM sys.resource_stats 
  WHERE database_name='<Database name>' 
  SELECT * FROM sys.event_log 
  WHERE database_name='<Database name>'
  ```

* If you cannot log on, follow the steps in **Unable to login to the server** and **Connections failing from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

## Unable to login to the server (Errors 18456, 40531)

### Login failed for user '< User name >'

**Detailed Error**

``Login failed for user '<User name>'.This session has been assigned a tracing ID of '<Tracing ID>'. Provide this tracing ID to customer support when you need assistance. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 18456)``

To resolve this issue, contact your service administrator to provide you the valid SQL user name and password. For more information, see [Managing Databases and Logins in Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-manage-logins/).

Typically, the service administrator can use the following steps to add the login:

1. Log in to the server using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Check whether the login name is disabled by using the following SQL query:

   ```
   SELECT name, is_disabled FROM sys.sql_logins
   ```

3. If the corresponding name is disabled, enable it by using the following statement: 

   ```
   Alter login <User name> enable
   ```

4. If the SQL login user name does not exist, create it by using SSMS:

   1. Double-click **Security** to expand it. 
   2. Right-click **Logins**, and then select **New login**. 
   3. In the generated script with placeholders, you can edit and run the following SQL query:
 
   ```
   CREATE LOGIN <SQL_login_name, sysname, login_name>
   WITH PASSWORD = ‘<password, sysname, Change_Password>’
   GO
   ```       
5. Double-click **Database**. 
6. Select the database to which you want to grant user the permission.
7. Double-click **Security**. 
8. Right-click **Users**, and then select **New User**. 
9. In the generated script with placeholders, you can edit and run the following SQL query: 

   ```
   CREATE USER <user_name, sysname, user_name>          
   FOR LOGIN <login_name, sysname, login_name>
   WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = <default_schema, sysname, dbo>
   GO
   
   -- Add user to the database owner role

   EXEC sp_addrolemember N’db_owner’, N’<user_name, sysname, user_name>’
   GO
   ```
   
   **Note**: You can also use `sp_addrolemember` to map specific users to specific database roles. 

### Server name cannot be determined

**Detailed Error**

``Server name cannot be determined. It must appear as the first segment of the server's dns name (servername.database.windows.net). Some libraries do not send the server name, in which case the server name must be included as part of the user name (username@servername). In addition, if both formats are used, the server names must match. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 40531)``

To resolve this issue, make sure that user name is specified as username@servername. For example, if the user name is **user1** and the fully qualified server name is **abc123.database.windows.net**, you should specify user name as **user1@abc123**. 

## Connection timeout expired errors

### System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): Connection Timeout Expired.

**Detailed Error**

``System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): Connection Timeout Expired. The timeout period elapsed while attempting to consume the pre-login handshake acknowledgement. This could be because the pre-login handshake failed or the server was unable to respond back in time. The duration spent while attempting to connect to this server was - [Pre-Login] initialization=3; handshake=29995;``

The exception 0x80131904 can occur either because of connection or query issues. To confirm this error is because of connectivity issues, review the stack trace for frames that show calls to open a connection like the following ones (Note the reference to the **SqlConnection** class):

```
System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.TryOpen(TaskCompletionSource`1 retry)
 at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.Open()
 at AzureConnectionTest.Program.Main(String[] args)
ClientConnectionId:<Client connection ID>
```

When the exception happens due to query issues, you will notice a call stack that is similar to the following ones (Note the reference to the **SqlConnection** class).In these scenarios, you have to [tune your queries](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlblog/archive/2013/11/01/is-my-query-running-fine-in-the-cloud.aspx).

```
  at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.ExecuteReader()
  at AzureConnectionTest.Program.Main(String[] args)
  ClientConnectionId:<Client ID>
```

To resolve the issue you can try the following steps (in that order):

1. Check the application’s connection string to make sure that it is correctly configured. For example, make sure that the connection string specifies the correct port (1433) and the fully qualified server name.

See [Obtain the connection string from the Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-connectivity-issues/#connections-to-azure-sql-database).

2. Make sure that TCP IP is enabled as a client protocol on the application server. For more information, see [Configure client protocols](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181035.aspx).

## Transient errors (Errors 40197, 40545)

### Error 40197: The service has encountered an error processing your request. Please try again. Error code < code >

This issue occurs because of a transient error encountered during a reconfiguration/failover on the backend.

To resolve this issue, wait a short period and retry. No support case is required unless the issue remains persistent.

### Error 40545: The service is experiencing a problem that is currently under investigation.

1. Check the [Microsoft Azure Service Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=168847) for any known outages.
2. If there are no known outages go to the [Microsoft Azure Support website](http://azure.microsoft.com/support/options) to open a support case.

## Connection Terminated due to hitting some system-defined limit

### Error 10928: Resource ID: %d.

**Detailed Error**

``10928 : Resource ID: %d. The %s limit for the database is %d and has been reached. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267637 for assistance. The Resource ID value in error message indicates the resource for which limit has been reached. For sessions, Resource ID = 2.``

To work around this issue, try one of the following methods:
* Verify whether there are long-running queries:

  **Note** This is a minimalist approach that may not necessarily resolve the issue.

  1. Check the [sys.dm_exec_requests](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms177648(v=sql.120).aspx) view to see any blocking requests, by executing the following SQL query:

   ```
   SELECT * FROM dm_exec_requests
   ```

  2. Determine the inputbuffer for the head blocker.
  3. Tune the head blocker query.

### Error 10929: Resource ID: 1.

**Detailed Error**

``10929: Resource ID: 1. The %s minimum guarantee is %d, maximum limit is %d and the current usage for the database is %d. However, the server is currently too busy to support requests greater than %d for this database. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267637 for assistance. Otherwise, please try again later.``

### Error 40501: The service is currently busy

**Detailed Error**

``40501: The service is currently busy. Retry the request after 10 seconds. Incident ID: %ls. Code: %d.``

This is an engine throttling error, for more info about throttling error, see [Azure SQL Database resource limits](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-resource-limits/) and the **SQL Database Throttling** section in [Windows Azure SQL Database Performance and Elasticity Guide](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/3507.windows-azure-sql-database-performance-and-elasticity-guide.aspx).

### Error 40544 : The database has reached its size quota

**Detailed Error**

``40544 : The database has reached its size quota. Partition or delete data, drop indexes, or consult the documentation for possible resolutions. Incident ID: <ID>. Code: <code>.``

This error happens when the database size exceeds the currently configured maximum size.

The following steps can help you with either working around the problem or provide you with additional options that you can consider to

1. Check the current size of the database by using the dashboard in Azure management portal.

   **Note**: To identify which tables are consuming the most space and potential candidates for cleanup, you can use the following SQL query:

   ```
   SELECT o.name,
    a.SUM(p.row_count) AS 'Row Count',
    b.SUM(p.reserved_page_count) * 8.0 / 1024 AS 'Table Size (MB)'
   FROM sys.objects o
   JOIN sys.dm_db_partition_stats p on p.object_id = o.object_id
   GROUP BY o.name
   ORDER BY [Table Size (MB)] DESC
   ```

2. If the current size does not exceed the maximum size supported for your edition , you can use ALTER DATABASE to increase the MAXSIZE setting. 
3. If the database size is already past the maximum supported size for your edition, you can take one of the following steps:
   1. Perform normal database cleanup activities (cleaning up the unwanted data by using truncate/delete etc. or move data out using SSIS, bcp etc.)
   2. Consider upgrading your edition to another edition that supports higher database sizes. For more information, check the following two links: 
   * [Basic, Standard, and Premium Preview for Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/).
   * [SQL Database Pricing Details](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/).

### Error 40549: Session is terminated because you have a long-running transaction.

**Detailed Error**

``40549 : Session is terminated because you have a long-running transaction. Try shortening your transaction.``

If you repeatedly encounter this error message, try the following steps to resolve this issue: 

1. Check the sys.dm_exec_requests view to see any open sessions that have a high value for the total_elapsed_time column by executing the following SQL Script:

   ```
   SELECT * FROM dm_exec_requests
   ```
2. Determine the inputbuffer for the query that is long running. 
3. Tune the query.

For an in-depth troubleshooting procedure, see [Is my query running fine in the cloud?](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlblog/archive/2013/11/01/is-my-query-running-fine-in-the-cloud.aspx).

### Error 40551: The session has been terminated because of excessive TEMPDB usage.

**Detailed Error**

``40551 : The session has been terminated because of excessive TEMPDB usage. Try modifying your query to reduce the temporary table space usage.``

To work around this issue, follow these steps: 
1. Change the queries to reduce the temporary table space usage. 
2. Drop temporary objects after they are no longer needed. 
3. Truncate tables, or remove unused tables.

### Error 40552: The session has been terminated because of excessive transaction log space usage.

**Detailed Error**

``40552 : The session has been terminated because of excessive transaction log space usage. Try modifying fewer rows in a single transaction.``

To resolve this issue, follow these methods: 

* The issue occurs because of insert, update, or delete operations. 
Try to reduce the number of rows that are operated on immediately by implementing batching or splitting into multiple smaller transactions.
* The issue occurs because of the index rebuild operations. Make sure that you adhere to the following formula: 
number of rows that are affected in table * (average size of field that is updated in bytes + 80) < 2 GB

  **Note** For index rebuild, the average size of the field that is updated should be substituted by average index size.

### Error 40553: The session has been terminated because of excessive memory usage.

**Detailed Error**

``40553 : The session has been terminated because of excessive memory usage. Try modifying your query to process fewer rows.``

To work around this issue, try to optimize the query.

## Connections failing from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

### This version of Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express can only be used to connect to SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005 servers.(Microsoft.sqlServer.Express.connectionDlg)

This issue occurs because of the earlier versions of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) are not supported.

To resolve this issue, download and install one of the following supported versions of SSMS:

* [SQL Server Management Studio Express (2014)](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42299)
* [SQL Server Management Studio Express (2012)](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=29062)

  **Note** You can also use SQL Server 2008 R2 SSMS. For more information, check this link.

### Cannot open database "master" requested by the login. The login failed.

This issue occurs because the account does not have access permission to the master database. However, by default, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) tries to connect to the master database.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. On the login screen of SSMS, click **Options**, then click **Connection Properties**. 
2. In **Connect to database**, type the user’s default database name as the default login database, then click **Connect**.
