# Tutorial: Order Azure Data Box

Azure Data Box Disk is a cloud solution that allows you to import your on-premises data into Azure in a quick, easy, and reliable way. You transfer your data to solid-state disks (SSDs) supplied by Microsoft and ship the disks back. This data is then uploaded to Azure.

This tutorial describes how you can order an Azure Data Box. In this tutorial, you learn about:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Sign up for Data Box
> * Order a Data Box
> * Track the order
> * Cancel the order

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following configuration prerequisites for Data Box service and device before you deploy the device.

### For service

Before you begin, make sure that:
- You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.

### For device

Before you begin, make sure that:
- You should have a host computer connected to the datacenter network. Data Box will copy the data from this computer. Your host computer must run a supported operating system as described in [Azure Data Box system requirements](azure-data-box-system-requirements).
- Your datacenter needs to have high speed network. We strongly recommend that you have at least one 10 GbE connection. If a 10 GbE connection is not available, a 1 GbE data link can be used but the copy speeds are impacted.


## Order Data Box

Perform the following steps in the Azure portal to order a device.

1. Use your Microsoft Azure credentials to log in at this URL: [https://aka.ms/azuredatabox](https://aka.ms/azuredatabox).
2. Click **+ Create a resource** and search for *Azure Data Box*. Click **Azure Data Box**.
    
   [![Search Azure Data Box 1](media/azure-data-box-deploy-ordered/search-azure-data-box1.png)](media/azure-data-box-deploy-ordered/search-azure-data-box1.png#lightbox)

3. Click **Create**.

4. Check if Data Box service is available in your region. Enter or select the following information and click **Apply**. 
    |Setting  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Subscription     | Select the subscription you want to use for Data Box service. <br> The subscription is linked to your billing account.       |
    |Transfer type     | Select **Import to Azure**.        |
    |Source country     |	Select the country where your data currently resides.         |
    |Destination Azure region     | 	Select the Azure region where you want to transfer data.        |

5. Select Data Box. The maximum solution capacity for a single order is 80 TB. You can create multiple orders for larger data sizes.

6. In **Order**, specify the **Order details**. Enter or select the following information and click **Next**.

    
    |Setting  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Name     |  Provide a friendly name to track the order. <br> The name can have between 3 and 24 characters that can be letters, numbers, and hyphens. <br> The name must start and end with a letter or a number.      |
    |Resource group     |	Use an existing or create a new one. <br> A resource group is a logical container for the resources that can be managed or deployed together.         |
    |Destination Azure region     | Select a region for your storage account. <br> Currently, storage accounts in all of US, West Europe, and North Europe regions are supported.        |
    |Storage account(s)     | Based on the specified Azure region, select one or more storage account from the filtered list of an existing storage account. Data Box can be linked with up to 10 storage accounts. <br> You can also create a new **General purpose v1**, **General purpose v2**, or **Blob storage account**.        |
    
7. In the **Shipping address**, provide your first and last name, name and postal address of the company, and a valid phone number. Click **Validate address**. The service validates the shipping address for service availability. If the service is available for the specified shipping address, you receive a notification to that effect. Click **Next**.

8. In the **Notification details**, specify email addresses. The service sends email notifications regarding any updates to the order status to the specified email addresses.

    We recommend that you use a group email so that you continue to receive notifications if an admin in the group leaves.

9. Review the information **Summary** related to the order, contact, notification, and privacy terms. Check the box corresponding to the agreement to privacy terms.

10. Click **Order**. The order takes a few minutes to be created. 


## Track the order

After you have placed the order, you can track the status of the order from Azure portal. Go to your order and then go to **Overview** to view the status. The portal shows the order in **Ordered** state.

If the device is not available, you receive a notification. If the device is available, Microsoft identifies the device for shipment and prepares the shipment. During device preparation, following actions occur:

- SMB shares are created for each storage account associated with the device. 
- For each share, access credentials such as username and password are generated.
- Device password that helps unlock the device is also generated. 
- The Data Box is locked to prevent anyone from accessing the device while in transit.

When the device preparation is complete, the portal shows the order in **Processed** state.

Microsoft then prepares and dispatches your device via a regional carrier. You receive a tracking number once the device is shipped. The portal shows the order in **Dispatched** state.

## Cancel the order

To cancel this order, in the Azure portal, go to **Overview** and click **Cancel** from the command bar.

You can only cancel when the device is ordered and the order is being processed for shipment. Once the order is processed, you can no longer cancel the order.

To delete a canceled order, go to Overview and click Delete from the command bar.
