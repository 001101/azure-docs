# Use the Azure Portal to manage Data Box Disk Customer Managed Shipping

This article describes the process workflow and customer-managed shipping (CMS) tasks to order, pick-up, and drop off of an Azure Data Box Disk device. You can manage the Data Box Disk using the Azure portal. The customer can designate a point of contact from their organization, or use any carrier of their choice to pick up the Azure Data Box Disk from a distribution center and also return the device back to the distribution center. The customer will need to follow distribution center's security procedures as both parties will sign off at particular points between pick-up and drop-off. At pick-up and drop-off, the customer or point of contact will be assigned an authorization code (authcode). This authcode needs to be presented during device pick-up and drop-off at the distribution center.

## Prerequisites

Customer Managed Shipping for Azure Data Box and Azure Data Box Disc is only available to the following Regions:

1. Western Europe
2. Japan
3. Singapore
4. South Korea
5. India (CMS only)

For detailed information regarding prerequisites and Azure Portal usage, see [Quickstart: Deploy Azure Data Box Heavy using the Azure portal](data-box-heavy-quickstart-portal.md)

## Order an Azure Data Box from your supported region

1. When choosing shipping type, if you are located in a supported region, you will have the option of selecting **Self-managed shipping**.

2. After you fill out the fields, you will need to verify/validate your email address.

3. Ready for Pick-up in progress. You need to click on **Schedule Pickup**.

4. Follow the instructions in the **Schedule pickup for Azure**. Before you can get your authcode, you must email [adbops@microsoft.com](mailto:adbops@microsoft.com) to schedule the device pickup from your region's distribution center.

5. After you have made contact with ADBOPs, you will be able to view your **Authorization Code** for your device in the **Schedule pickup for Azure**.

   Write this number down or print it.

6. Ready for pickup in progress.
   Your order automatically moves to this state once the device prep has completed. You will receive an email instructing you to contact ADB ops to schedule an appointment to come to the distribution center for pickup.

   You also need to provide details of who will be going to the distribution center for pickup. You or the point of contact has to carry a Government approved photo ID that will be validated at the distribution center. Ops will need to include this person's details so that it can be verified during pickup.

   Additionally, the person who is picking up the device also needs to have the **Authorization code** that is available in the Portal under **Schedule Pick up**. This code is also validated at the distribution center time of pickup.

<!-- 7. After you have scheduled an appointment for pickup and shared the pickup point of contact's details. -->

7. After the device is picked up, the customer needs to finish data copy and then drop off the device back at the DC.

    The authcode for drop off will be available on the portal itself under **Schedule drop off**.
Â    Once you have finished data copy, you will need to contact operations to schedule an appointment for the drop off. If you plan on using a point of contact, you will need to include their personal details. The distribution center will also need to the authcode.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Do not share the authcode over email. This is only to be verified at the distribution center during drop off.

8. You should now be at **Ready to receive** success state of the Azure portal. This means that you have scheduled an appointment for drop off and shared the drop off point of contact's details. You will also need to confirm that the distribution center also has the authcode available.

9. Customer or point of contact has dropped off the device at the DC and their ID and authcode have been verified.

10. After drop-off, Microsoft will copy your data to their servers. The Azure portal should be at the **Copy in progress**.

11. When your data and finished copying successfully, Azure portal will indicate that the copy of your data is complete.
