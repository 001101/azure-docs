# Use self-managed shipping for Azure Data Box Disk in the Azure portal

This article describes self-managed shipping tasks to order, pick-up, and drop-off of an Azure Data Box Disk device. You can manage the Data Box Disk using the Azure portal. You have the option of choosing a point of contact from your organization, or use any carrier of your choice to pick up the Azure Data Box Disk device from a datacenter and also return the device back to the datacenter.

It is important that you follow the datacenter's security procedures as sign-off is required at particular points between pickup and drop-off. You, or your point of contact, will be required to present the authorization code obtained from the Azure portal during device pick-up and drop-off.

## Prerequisites

Self-managed shipping for Azure Data Box Disk is only available to the following regions:

1. Western Europe
2. Japan
3. Singapore
4. South Korea
5. India

## Use self-managed shipping

When you place a Data Box Disk order, you can choose self-managed shipping option.

6. After you have scheduled your device pickup, you will be able to view your authorization code in the  **Schedule pickup for Azure**.

   Make a note of this **Authorization code**.

   You also need to provide details of who will be going to the datacenter for pickup. You or the point of contact has to carry a Government approved photo ID that will be validated at the datacenter.

   Additionally, the person who is picking up the device also needs to have the **Authorization code**. The authorization code is validated at the datacenter time of pickup.

7. Your order automatically moves to the **Picked up** state once the device preparation is complete. You will receive an email instructing you to contact Microsoft to schedule a pickup appointment at the datacenter.

8. Once you have picked up the device, you may copy data to the Data Box Disk(s) at your site. After the data copy is complete, you can prepare to ship the Data Box Disk.

    The authorization code for drop off will be available in Azure portal under **Schedule drop off**.
Â    nce you have finished data copy, you will need to contact operations to schedule an appointment for the drop off. You will need to share the details of the person coming to the datacenter to drop off the disks. The datacenter will also need to verify the authorization code at the time of drop-off.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Do not share the authorization code over email. This is only to be verified at the datacenter during drop off.

9. If you have scheduled an appointment for drop off and shared the drop off point of contact's details, then you should now be at the **Ready to receive at Azure datacenter** state in the Azure portal.
