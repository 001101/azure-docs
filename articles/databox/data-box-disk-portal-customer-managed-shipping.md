# Use the Azure Portal to manage Data Box Disk Customer Managed Shipping

This article describes the process workflow and customer managed shipping (CMS) tasks to order, pick-up, and drop off of an Azure Data Box Disk. You can manage the Data Box Disk device using the Azure portal. Since some organizations are working with sensitive data, it's imperative that there is a method for Microsoft and the customer to handle device logistics in a secure manner where the customer has control over. The customer can designate a point of contact from their organization, or use any carrier of their choice to pick up the Azure Data Box Disk device from a distribution center and also return the device back to the distribution center. The customer will need to follow distribution center's security procedures, so both parties will need to sign off at particular points between pick-up and drop-off. At many of the stages of the workflow, you will be using an assigned authorization code (authcode) that you, the customer, and the distribution center will use for that security.

## Prerequisites

Customer Managed Shipping for Azure Data Box and Azure Data Box Disc is only available to the following Regions:

1. Western Europe
2. Japan
3. Singapore
4. South Korea
5. India (CMS only)

4. Follow the instructions in the **Schedule pickup for Azure**. Before you can get your authorization code, you must email [adbops@microsoft.com](mailto:adbops@microsoft.com) to schedule the device pickup from your region's distribution center.

   Write this number down or print it.

6. Ready for pickup in progress.
   Your order automatically moves to this state once the device prep has completed. You will receive an email instructing you to contact ADB ops to schedule an appointment to come to the distribution center for pick up.

   You also need to provide details of who will be coming for the pick up. You or the point of contact has to carry a Government approved photo ID that will be validated at the DC. Ops will need to include this person's details so that it can be verified during pick up.

   Additionally, the person who is picking up the device also needs to have the **Authorization code** that is available in the Portal under **Schedule Pick up**. This code is also validated at the distribution center time of pick up.

7. After you have scheduled an appointment for pick up and shared the pick up point of contact's details.

8. After the device is picked up, the customer needs to finish data copy and then drop off the device back at the DC.

    Auth code for drop off will be available on the portal itself under **Schedule drop off**.
Â    Once you have finished data copy, you will need to contact operations to schedule an appointment for the drop off. If you plan on using a point of contact, you will need to include their personal details. The distribution center will also need to the authorization code.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Do not share the authorization code over email. This is only to be verified at the distribution center during drop off.

9. You should now be at **Ready to receive** success state of the Azure portal. This means that you have scheduled an appointment for drop off and shared the drop off point of contact's details. You will also need to confirm that the distribution center also has the authorization code available.

10. Customer or point of contact has dropped off the device at the DC and their ID and authorization code have been verified.
