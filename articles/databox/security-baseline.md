### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23595).

**Guidance**: Azure Data Box implements AES 256-bit encryption for Data-at-rest.

Additionally, Azure Data Box protects the device unlock key (also known as device password) that is used to lock the device via an encryption key. By default, device unlock key for a Data Box order is encrypted with a Microsoft managed key. For additional control over device unlock key, you can also provide a customer-managed key. Customer-managed keys must be created and stored in an Azure Key Vault. 

For Azure Data Box Gateway, access to data stored in shares is restricted. SMB clients that access share data need user credentials associated with the share. These credentials are defined when the share is created. The IP addresses of NFS clients that access a share need to be added when the share is created.

Your device is associated with a storage account that's used as a destination for your data in Azure. Access to the storage account is controlled by the subscription and two 512-bit storage access keys associated with that storage account. One of the keys is used for authentication when the Azure Stack Edge device accesses the storage account. The other key is held in reserve, so you can rotate the keys periodically.
