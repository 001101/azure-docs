# Manage customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault for Azure Data Box

Azure Data Box protects the device unlock key (also known as device password) that is used to lock the device via an encryption key. By default, the device unlock key for a Data Box order is encrypted with a Microsoft managed key. For additional control over the device unlock key, you can instead use a customer-managed key.

Customer-managed keys must be created and stored in an Azure Key Vault. For more information about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../key-vault/general/overview.md).

You can configure a customer-managed key when you place a Data Box order or add one after the order is processed. For information about configuring a customer-managed key when you order your Data Box, see [Tutorial: Order Azure Data Box](data-box-deploy-ordered.md).  

This article shows how to use customer-managed keys with Azure Data Box in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). This article applies to both Azure Data Box devices and Azure Data Box Heavy devices.

## Requirements

- The key is created and stored in an Azure Key Vault. For more information about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../key-vault/general/overview.md). 

  You can create a key vault when add a customer-managed key to a new or completed Data Box order or separately.To learn how to create a key vault using the Azure portal, see [Quickstart: Set and retrieve a secret from Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal](../key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal.md).

- The key vault is in the same region as the storage accounts used for your data. Multiple storage accounts can be linked with your Azure Data Box resource.

- **Soft delete** and **Do not purge** are set on the key vault. These properties are not enabled by default. To enable these properties, see the **Enabling soft-delete** and **Enabling Purge Protection** sections in one of the following articles:
   - [How to use soft-delete with PowerShell](../key-vault/general/soft-delete-powershell.md).
   - [How to use soft-delete with CLI](../key-vault/general/soft-delete-cli.md).

- The key is an RSA key of 2048 size or larger.

## Add a key

To add a customer-managed key in the Azure portal after your Data Box order is complete, follow these steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can disable the Microsoft managed key and move to a customer-managed key at any stage of your Data Box order. However, once you create a customer-managed key, you can't switch back to the Microsoft-managed key.

1. Go to the **Overview** screen for your completed Data Box order.

2. Go to **Settings > Encryption**. Under **Encryption type**, you can choose how you want to protect your device unlock key. By default, a Microsoft managed key is used to protect your device unlock password. 

    ![Choose encryption option](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-2.png)

3. Select **Customer managed key** as the encryption type. Then select **Select a key vault and key**.

4. On the **Select key from Azure Key Vault** screen, the subscription is automatically populated. For **Key vault**, you can select an existing key vault from the dropdown list.

    You can also select **Create new** to create a new key vault. On the **Create key vault** screen, enter the resource group and a key vault name. Ensure that the **Soft delete** and **Purge protection** are enabled. Accept all other defaults. Select **Review + Create**.

5. Review the information associated with your key vault and select **Create**. Wait for a couple minutes for key vault creation to complete.

6. In the **Select key from Azure Key Vault**, you can select a key in the existing key vault.

7. If you want to create a new key, select **Create new**. RSA key size can be 2048 or greater.

8. Enter a name for your key, accept the other defaults, and select **Create**.

    ![Create new key](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-7.png)

9. You are notified that a key is created in your key vault. Select the **Version** and then choose **Select**.

10. In the **Encryption type** settings, you can see the key vault and the key selected for your customer-managed key.

11. Save the key.

    ![Save customer-managed key](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-10.png)

    The key URL is displayed under **Encryption type**.

## Troubleshoot errors

If you receive any errors related to your customer-managed key, use the following table to troubleshoot.<!--Two new error codes expected?-->

| Error   code| Error details| Recoverable?|
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| SsemUserErrorEncryptionKeyDisabled| Could not fetch the passkey as the customer managed key is disabled.| Yes, by enabling the key version.|
| SsemUserErrorEncryptionKeyExpired| Could not fetch the passkey as the customer managed key has expired.| Yes, by enabling the key version.|
| SsemUserErrorKeyDetailsNotFound| Could not fetch the passkey as the customer managed key could not be found.| If you deleted the key vault, you can't recover the customer-managed key.
