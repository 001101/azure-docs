# Use customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault for Azure Data Box

Azure Data Box protects the device unlock key (also known as the device password), which is used to lock a device, via an encryption key. By default, this encryption key is a Microsoft managed key. For additional control, you can use a customer-managed key.

Using a customer-managed key doesn't affect how data on the device is encrypted. It only affects how the device unlock key is encrypted.

To keep this level of control throughout the order process, use a customer-managed key when you create your order. For more information, see [Tutorial: Order Azure Data Box](data-box-deploy-ordered.md).

This article shows how to change the type of encryption key for an existing Data Box order, or to change the key vault, key, identity type, or user identity that you're using for a customer-managed key, via the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). This article applies to Azure Data Box and Azure Data Box Heavy devices.

## Requirements

The customer-managed key for a Data Box order must meet the following requirements:

- The key must be created and stored in an Azure Key Vault that has **Soft delete** and **Do not purge** enabled. For more information, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../key-vault/general/overview.md). You can create a key vault and key while creating or updating your order.

- The key must be an RSA key of 2048 size or larger.

## Change the key for an order

To change the encryption key used for a Data Box order in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Overview** screen for your completed Data Box order.

    ![Overview screen of a Data Box order](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-1.png)

2. Go to **Settings > Encryption**. Under **Encryption type**, you can choose how you want to protect your device unlock key, by using either a Microsoft managed key or a customer-managed key. You can select either key type when you place your Data Box order and change it later.

    ![Choose encryption option](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-2.png)

    If you want to switch from a customer-managed key to a Microsoft managed key, simply select **Microsoft managed key**. No other steps are needed.

    If you want to switch to a customer-managed key or change the key vault, key, identity type, or identity for your existing customer-managed key, complete the following steps.

3. If you're changing to a customer-managed key, select **Customer managed key** as the encryption type. Then select **Select a key vault and key**. If you're changing an existing key, you'll select **Change the key vault and key**.

    ![Select customer-managed key](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-3.png)

4. On the **Select key from Azure Key Vault** screen, you can select or change the key vault and key. The subscription is automatically populated.

   - For **Key vault**, you can select an existing key vault from the dropdown list.

     ![Select existing Azure Key Vault](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-3-a.png)

    - Or select **Create new** to create a new key vault. On the **Create key vault** screen, enter the resource group and a key vault name. Ensure that **Soft delete** and **Purge protection** are enabled. Accept all other defaults. Select **Review + Create**.

      ![Review and create Azure Key Vault](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-4.png)

      Review the information for your key vault, and select **Create**. Wait for a couple minutes for key vault creation to complete.

       ![Create Azure Key Vault with your settings](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-5.png)

5. On the **Select key from Azure Key Vault** screen, you can select an existing key from the key vault.

    ![Select key from Azure Key Vault](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-6.png)

   If you want to create a new key, select **Create new**. You must use an RSA key. The size can be 2048 or greater.

    ![Create new key in Azure Key Vault](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-6-a.png)

   Enter a name for your new key, accept the other defaults, and select **Create**. You'll be notified that a key has been created in your key vault.

    ![Name new key](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-7.png)

6. For **Version**, select the version of the key to use - the current version or an earlier one from the drop-down list, or select **Create new** to generate a new version. For more information, see PROCEDURE FOR GENERATING A KEY.<!--Find the link.-->

    ![Select version for new key](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-8.png)

    When you've selected a key vault, key, and key version, click **Select**.

    The **Encryption type** settings show the key vault and key that you chose.<!--STOPPED HERE, 11/12-->

7. Select the type of identity to use to manage the customer-managed key for this resource. You can use the **system assigned** identity that was generated during order creation or select **user assigned** and choose an identity of your own.

    A user-assigned identity is an independent resource that you can use to manage access to resources. For more information, see [Managed identity types](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

    ![Select the identity type](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-13.png)<!--Reshoot. First screenshot should show just the two selection types. The option to use a system assigned identity type is not included in the Order wizard.-->

    If you want to assign a user identity, select **Select a user identity** and then select your managed identity that you want to use.<!--Stopped shooting screens here (11/06).-->

    ![Select an identity to use](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-14.png)<!--Edit current screen from the Order tutorial to sub new options in the Encryption Type settings.-->

    You can't create a new user identity here. To find out how to create one, see [Create, list, delete or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity using the Azure portal](/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal).

    The selected user identity is shown in the **Encryption type** settings.

 12. Save the key settings.<!--Check the Save button context. Not just saving a key. New screenshot may not be needed. Save command is boxed in the previous screenshot.-->

     ![Save customer-managed key](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-10.png)

The key URL is displayed under **Encryption type**.
