# What is Azure Blockchain Workbench?

Azure Blockchain Workbench is a collection of Azure services and capabilities designed to help you create and deploy blockchain applications to share business processes and data with other organizations. Azure Blockchain Workbench provides the infrastructure scaffolding for building blockchain applications enabling developers to focus on creating business logic and smart contracts. Azure Blockchain Workbench orchestrates several Azure services with popular blockchains into a reference architecture, which can be used to build blockchain applications. 

With Azure Blockchain Workbench you can:

* Create blockchain applications.
* Manage Workbench blockchain applications and users.
* Integrate blockchain workflows with existing systems and applications leveraging Microsoft Flow and Logic Apps. 
* Extend Workbench using a REST API or a message-based API for system-to-system integration. 
* Extend your existing applications to use blockchain ledgers.
* Deploy a consortium blockchain network.
* Associate and abstract blockchain identities with Active Directory for easier login and collaboration.
* Synchronize on-chain data with off-chain storage and databases to more easily query attestations and visualize ledger activity. 

## Capabilities

### Federated identity

Workbench provides the capability for a consortium to federate their Enterprise identities using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Workbench generates new user accounts for on-chain identities with the enterprise identities stored in Azure AD. The identity mapping facilitates authenticated login to client APIs and applications and leverages the authentication policies of organizations. Workbench also provides the ability to associate enterprise identities to specific roles within a given smart contract. In addition, Workbench also provides a mechanism to identify the actions those roles can take and at what time.

### Client applications

Workbench provides automatically generated client applications for web and mobile (iOS, Android), which can be used to validate, test, and view blockchain applications. The application interface is dynamically generated based on smart contract metadata (Workbench configuration) and can accommodate any use case. The clients enable rapid iteration and testing of smart contracts by developers.

### Blockchain transactions

Workbench can be used to deploy a blockchain network. Once deployed, Workbench can transform messages sent to its message-based API to build transactions in a format expected by that blockchainâ€™s native API.  Workbench can sign and route transactions to the appropriate blockchain. 

Workbench currently supports Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric (private preview).

### Robust integration

Workbench provides a REST-based API for client development, a message-based API for system-to-system integration, and an off-chain data store providing access to data using SQL. Workbench also provides a client library and samples developers can use to create a diversity of client types, such as bots or integration with IoT devices.

### Off-chain data and storage

Workbench automatically synchronizes data stored on the blockchain with an off-chain storage, such as a SQL database. In addition, Workbench relies on Azure Storage to store documents and other media associated with blockchain workflows. The database can be used to extend the system to leverage data visualization and intelligence as well as integration with other clients, services, or systems.

### Key management

Workbench uses Azure Key Vault to store keys and secrets for client applications and establishment of on-chain identities.

### Event Publishing

Workbench automatically delivers events to Service Bus and Event Grid to send messages to downstream consumers. Developers can integrate with either of these messaging systems to drive transactions and to look at results. Capabilities for off-chain data and storage are built using this functionality.

### Monitoring

Workbench provides end to end application logging using Application Insights and Azure Monitor. Logging including warnings, errors, and successes.
