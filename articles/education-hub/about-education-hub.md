# What is the Azure Education Hub?

The Microsoft Azure [Education Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/quickstart) is a tool that helps academic users provision and manage
cloud credit across many different Azure subscriptions. This is useful when faculty
members need to manage many cloud-based student projects. The Education Hub is also useful for research purposes when your Azure credit needs are not yet known. Users can easily adjust the amount of allocated credit within each subscription or in bulk. Subscriptions can also be suspended—for example, when a semester or quarter project is complete—to maximize available credits.

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

<!---Screenshots and videos can add another way to show and tell the overview story. But don’t overdo them. Make sure that they offer value for the overview.
If users access your product/service via a web browser, the first screenshot should always include the full browser window in Chrome or Safari. This is to show users that the portal is browser-based - OS and browser agnostic.

## Prerequisites

To access the Education Hub, you should already have received an email notification that you've been approved for an Academic Grant. The email contains your approved credit
amount and a link to the [Education Hub](https://aka.ms/startedu).

To use your Academic Grant, you must create a classroom in the
Education Hub and use subscriptions within the classroom that will access your Azure credit.

## How do I get support?

Most sponsored academic offers include a Developer tier of Azure Support for free. Microsoft also offers an [Educator Services Desk](azuredu@microsoft.com) where your local Microsoft representative or teaching assistant (TA) can request support for any questions or issues regarding the Education Hub, including setup issues.
