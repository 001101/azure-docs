# Frequently asked questions about Azure Dev Tools for Teaching

This article addresses frequent questions about student subscriptions, Azure for Students Starter, and Azure Dev Tools for Teaching.

## Azure for students

### What happens after I use my $100 credit or I’m at the end of 12 months?

After you exhaust your available credit or reach the end of 12 months, your Azure subscription will be disabled. To continue using [Azure](https://account.azure.com/), you may upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription in the Azure Account Portal.

### What are subscriptions, and how do they relate to Azure for Students?

Subscriptions provide access to Azure services. Azure for Students gives you $100 credit for 12 months and access to more than 25 free services, including compute, network, storage, and databases. Any charges incurred during this period are deducted from the credit. To continue using Azure at the end of 12 months or after you’ve exhausted your $100 credit, whichever occurs first, you must upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

### What happens with my Azure services if I don’t upgrade?

If you decide not to upgrade at the end of 12 months or after you’ve exhausted your $100 credit, whichever occurs first, any products you’ve deployed will be decommissioned and you won’t be able to access them. You can always come back within the next 90 days to upgrade your subscription.

### How do I know how much of the $100 credit I have left?

You can see your remaining credit on the Microsoft [Azure Sponsorships portal](http://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/).

### Why do I see a $0 Balance in the Azure Portal?

When you go to your subscription details in the Azure Account Portal, you will see $0.00. The reason for this is that this offer places a 100% discount off all services. Therefore, the portal will show you what you will be charged for during your monthly usage period, which should be $0.00.

Unfortunately, you cannot associate your course credits offer to any subscription that is on an account under an Enterprise Agreement. You must create a new account that is outside of the EA, which we can then entitle. Once the Sponsorship period has ended, you can associate that subscription back into the EA. If you associate, the account to your EA prior to the end of the Sponsorship, all sponsorship funds will be terminated. Please refer to the terms and conditions of the Sponsorship offer [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/).

Unfortunately, you cannot associate your course credits offer to any CSP subscription.

### I have a previous balance due, can I pay it off with my course credits?

Azure course credits only cover usage from the time you activate it. You are responsible for all charges prior to your offer start date.

### How do I know if my subscription is on the Azure course credit offer?
