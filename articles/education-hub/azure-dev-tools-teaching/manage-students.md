# How to enroll students in Azure Dev Tools for Teaching

After purchasing Azure Dev Tools for Teaching, all students located in your institution’s domain
will automatically get access to this offer. During the purchase process, you will be asked to
enter the Subscription Administrator’s email address. This university-verified domain will unlock
students with the same email domain the ability to log in and redeem their software download
benefits. If students do not already have a Microsoft Account (MSA) or are part of a University 
Active Directory, they will be prompted to create one that matches their university email. If
students are having issues accessing the Education Hub, have them look through our
Troubleshooting Guide below or contact us LINK https://aka.ms/studentsupport.

## Managing access for students

You can currently manage access for students based on the domain they use to log into Azure
Dev Tools for Teaching. To do so, go into your Management Portal LINK FOR MP 
https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/en-us/account/Subscriptions for Azure Dev Tools for
Teaching. Once in, you will see all your subscriptions. Choose the subscription you wish to
manage access for.

Once you have selected the appropriate subscription, you can adjust the University domain by
clicking **Edit** and changing the email domain you wish to grant access to for students. Once
updated, any student with that email domain will be granted access to Azure Dev Tools for
Teaching.
