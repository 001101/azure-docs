## How to enroll students

After purchasing Azure Dev Tools for Teaching, all students located in your institution’s domain
will automatically get access to this offer. During the purchase process, you will be asked to
enter the Subscription Administrator’s email address. This university-verified domain will unlock
students with the same email domain the ability to log in and redeem their software download
benefits. If students do not already have a Microsoft Account (MSA) or are part of a University 
Active Directory, they will be prompted to create one that matches their university email. If
students are having issues accessing the Education Hub, have them look through our
Troubleshooting Guide below or (contact us)[https://aka.ms/studentsupport].
