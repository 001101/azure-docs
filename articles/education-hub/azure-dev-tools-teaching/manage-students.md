<!-- OVERVIEW TEMPLATE>



# What is Azure Dev Tools? <!-- IS THIS THE RIGHT NAME/HEADING TO USE??>

<!---Required: 
For the H1 - that's the primary heading at the top of the article - use the format "What is <service>?"
You can also use this in the TOC if your service name doesn’t cause the phrase to wrap.
--->

Introductory paragraph.
<!---Required:
The introductory paragraph helps customers quickly determine whether an article is relevant.
Describe in customer-friendly terms what the service is and does, and why the customer should care. Keep it short for the intro.
You can go into more detail later in the article. Many services add artwork or videos below the introduction.
--->

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

<!---Screenshots and videos can add another way to show and tell the overview story. But don’t overdo them. Make sure that they offer value for the overview.
If users access your product/service via a web browser, the first screenshot should always include the full browser window in Chrome or Safari. This is to show users that the portal is browser-based - OS and browser agnostic.

## How to enroll students
After purchasing Azure Dev Tools for Teaching, all students located in your institution’s domain
will automatically get access to this offer. During the purchase process, you will be asked to
enter the Subscription Administrator’s email address. This university-verified domain will unlock
students with the same email domain the ability to log in and redeem their software download
benefits. If students do not already have a Microsoft Account (MSA) or are part of a University 
Active Directory, they will be prompted to create one that matches their university email. If
students are having issues accessing the Education Hub, have them look through our
Troubleshooting Guide below or contact us LINK https://aka.ms/studentsupport.

## Managing access for students
You can currently manage access for students based on the domain they use to log into Azure
Dev Tools for Teaching. To do so, go into your Management Portal LINK FOR MP https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/en-us/account/Subscriptionsfor Azure Dev Tools for
Teaching. Once in, you will see all your subscriptions. Choose the subscription you wish to
manage access for.

Once you have selected the appropriate subscription, you can adjust the University domain by
clicking ‘edit’ and changing the email domain you wish to grant access to for students. Once
updated, any student with that email domain will be granted access to Azure Dev Tools for
Teaching.

## Next steps

<!---Some context for the following links goes here--->
- [link to next logical step for the customer](global-quickstart-template.md)

<!--- Required:
In Overview articles, provide at least one next step and no more than three.
Next steps in overview articles will often link to a quickstart.
Use regular links; do not use a blue box link. What you link to will depend on what is really a next step for the customer.
Do not use a "More info section" or a "Resources section" or a "See also section".
