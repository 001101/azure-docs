# Quickstart: Set up a course and create a classroom

This quickstart explains how to set up a course and classroom in the Microsoft Azure Education Hub.

## Prerequisites

- An Academic Grant with an approved credit amount
- A subscription within the classroom that will access your Azure credit

## Subscriptions

A student will be given a subscription tied to a monetary cap of credit the professor
gives to them. The term *monetary cap* describes the US$ amount of an Academic Sponsorship. For example, a $1,000 monetary cap provides the recipient with a US$1,000 Azure credit using [published webdirect rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/).

The educator can choose to allocate a cap to the subscriptions to prevent
unintended use, and then set an expiration date. Some examples:

- **Flat amount per class**: Each student gets $*x* to manage for the entire quarter or
semester.

- **Flat amount per project group**: A project team receives $*x* to fund a group project

At the subscription level, you can increase or decrease the cap and changes will take effect with
minimal latency. When the class or project ends, you can reallocate unused cap to other subscriptions prior to the expiration date.

## Create a course and classroom

Follow this procedure to create a course and classroom using either of two different methods.

1. Select the **Courses** page in the Education Hub to open the tool you use to create and manage courses. A table opens showing all your existing courses.

1. You can create a course roster by using two methods: by uploading a roster or by using invitation code.
    - **Roster**: If you have the names and logins of all students already, you can populate a roster file and upload it. To download a sample file of the .csv needed to upload the roster, select the ‘Download sample file’ link in the upper right-hand corner.
    - **Invitation code**: If you choose to use an invitation code, decide how many codes can be redeemed, and when they will expire. You will send your students the following link to redeem the code: https://aka.ms/joinedu.

moments to complete.
