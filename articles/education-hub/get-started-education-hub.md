# Getting started with Azure Education Hub

The Education Hub Get Started page provides quick links upon first landing into the Education Hub. There, you can find information about how to set up your course, learn about different services through Microsoft Learn, or easily deploy your first services through Quickstart Templates.

After your first login, the Overview page is displayed.
