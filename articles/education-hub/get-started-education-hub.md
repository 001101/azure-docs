# Quickstart: Get started with the Education Hub 

The Education Hub Get Started page provides quick links upon first landing into the Education Hub. If
you want to set up your course, learn about different services through Microsoft Learn or easily deploy
your first services through Quickstart Templates. 

After your first login, by default you will be taken to the Overview page.
