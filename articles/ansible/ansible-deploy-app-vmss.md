- [!INCLUDE [ansible-prereqs-vm-scale-set.md](../../includes/ansible-prereqs-vm-scale-set.md)]
- **git** - [git](https://git-scm.com) is used to download a Java sample used in this tutorial.
- **Java SE Development Kit (JDK)** - The [JDK](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks) is used to build the sample Java project.
- **Apache Maven** - [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is used to build the sample Java project.

## Get host information

This section illustrates how to use Ansible to retrieve host information for a group of Azure virtual machines. Below is a sample Ansible playbook. The code gets the public IP addresses and load balancer within specified resource group, and creates a host group named **scalesethosts** in inventory.

Save the following sample playbook as `get-hosts-tasks.yml`:

  ```yml
  - name: Get facts for all Public IPs within a resource groups
    azure_rm_publicipaddress_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
    register: output_ip_address

  - name: Get loadbalancer info
    azure_rm_loadbalancer_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ loadbalancer_name }}"
    register: output

  - name: Add all hosts
    add_host:
      groups: scalesethosts
      hostname: "{{ output_ip_address.ansible_facts.azure_publicipaddresses[0].properties.ipAddress }}_{{ item.properties.frontendPort }}"
      ansible_host: "{{ output_ip_address.ansible_facts.azure_publicipaddresses[0].properties.ipAddress }}"
      ansible_port: "{{ item.properties.frontendPort }}"
      ansible_ssh_user: "{{ admin_username }}"
      ansible_ssh_pass: "{{ admin_password }}"
    with_items:
      - "{{ output.ansible_facts.azure_loadbalancers[0].properties.inboundNatRules }}"
  ```

## Prepare an application for deployment

In this section, you use git to clone a Java sample project from GitHub and build the project. Save the following playbook as `app.yml`:

  ```yml
  - hosts: localhost
    vars:
      repo_url: https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot.git
      workspace: ~/src/helloworld

    tasks:
    - name: Git Clone sample app
      git:
        repo: "{{ repo_url }}"
        dest: "{{ workspace }}"

    - name: Build sample app
      shell: mvn package chdir="{{ workspace }}/complete"
  ```

Run the sample Ansible playbook with the following command:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook app.yml
  ```

The output from the ansible-playbook command displays out similar to the following where you see that it built the sample app cloned from GitHub:

  ```Output
  PLAY [localhost] 

  TASK [Gathering Facts] 
  ok: [localhost]

  TASK [Git Clone sample app] 
  changed: [localhost]

  TASK [Build sample app] 
  changed: [localhost]

  PLAY RECAP 
  localhost                  : ok=3    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0

  ```

## Deploy the application to a scale set

The following section in an Ansible playbook installs the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) on a host group named **saclesethosts**, and deploys the Java application to a host group named **saclesethosts**:

(Change the `admin_password` to your own password.)

  ```yml
  - hosts: localhost
    vars:
      resource_group: myResourceGroup
      scaleset_name: myScaleSet
      loadbalancer_name: myScaleSetLb
      admin_username: azureuser
      admin_password: "your_password"
    tasks:
    - include: get-hosts-tasks.yml

  - name: Install JRE on a scale set
    hosts: scalesethosts
    become: yes
    vars:
      workspace: ~/src/helloworld
      admin_username: azureuser

    tasks:
    - name: Install JRE
      apt:
        name: default-jre
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Copy app to Azure VM
      copy:
        src: "{{ workspace }}/complete/target/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar"
        dest: "/home/{{ admin_username }}/helloworld.jar"
        force: yes
        mode: 0755

    - name: Start the application
      shell: java -jar "/home/{{ admin_username }}/helloworld.jar" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      async: 5000
      poll: 0
  ```

You can save the preceding sample Ansible playbook as `vmss-setup-deploy.yml`, or [download the entire sample playbook](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ansible-playbooks/blob/master/vmss).

To use the ssh connection type with passwords, you must install the sshpass program.
  - For Ubuntu 16.04, run the command `apt-get install sshpass`.
  - For CentOS 7.4, run the command `yum install sshpass`.

In some environments, you may see an error regarding using an SSH password instead of a key. If you do receive that error, you can disable host key checking by adding the following line to `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` or `~/.ansible.cfg`:

  ```bash
  [defaults]
  host_key_checking = False
  ```

Run the playbook with the following command:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook vmss-setup-deploy.yml
  ```

The output from running the ansible-playbook command indicates that the sample Java application has been installed to the host group of the scale set:

  ```Output
  PLAY [localhost]

  TASK [Gathering Facts]
  ok: [localhost]

  TASK [Get facts for all Public IPs within a resource groups]
  ok: [localhost]

  TASK [Get loadbalancer info]
  ok: [localhost]

  TASK [Add all hosts]
  changed: [localhost] ...

  PLAY [Install JRE on scale set]

  TASK [Gathering Facts]
  ok: [40.114.30.145_50000]
  ok: [40.114.30.145_50003]

  TASK [Copy app to Azure VM]
  changed: [40.114.30.145_50003]
  changed: [40.114.30.145_50000]

  TASK [Start the application]
  changed: [40.114.30.145_50000]
  changed: [40.114.30.145_50003]

  PLAY RECAP
  40.114.30.145_50000        : ok=4    changed=3    unreachable=0    failed=0
  40.114.30.145_50003        : ok=4    changed=3    unreachable=0    failed=0
  localhost                  : ok=4    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
  ```

Congratulation! Your application is running in Azure now. You can now navigate to the URL of the load balancer for your scale set:
