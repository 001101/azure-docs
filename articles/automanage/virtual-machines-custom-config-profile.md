# Create a custom configuration profile in Azure Automanage for VMs

Azure Automanage for virtual machine best practices has default configuration profiles that can be adjusted if needed. This article will explain how you can set your own configuration profile preferences when you enable automanagement on a new or existing VM.

We currently support customizations on [Azure Backup](ckup/backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md#create-a-custom-polic) and [Microsoft Antimalware](../security/fundamentals/antimalware.md#default-and-custom-antimalware-configuration).


> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change the configuration profile on your VM while Automanage is enabled. You will need to disable Automanage for that VM and then re-enable Automanage with the desired configuration profile and preferences.


## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) before you begin.

> [!NOTE]
> Free trial accounts do not have access to the virtual machines used in this tutorial. Please upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following RBAC permission is needed to enable Automanage: **Owner** role or **Contributor** along with **User Access Administrator** roles.
