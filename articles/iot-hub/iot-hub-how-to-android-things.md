# Develop for mobile devices using Azure IoT SDKs

[Azure IoT Hub SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks) provide first tier support for a wide range of popular platforms, including Windows, Linux, OSX, MBED, and mobile platforms like Android and iOS.  As part of our commitment to enable greater choice and flexibility in IoT deployments, the Java SDK also supports [Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/) platform.  Developers can leverage the benefits of Android Things operating system on the device side, while using [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub) as the central message hub that scales to millions of simultaneously connected devices. 

This tutorial outlines the steps to build a device side application on Android Things using the Azure IoT Java SDK.

## Prerequisites
* An Android Things supported hardware with Android Things OS running.  You can follow [Android Things documentation](https://developer.android.com/things/get-started/kits#flash-at) on how to flash Android Things.  This tutorial uses Raspberry Pi 3.
* Latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

## Building an Android Things application


## Next steps

* [IoT Hub REST API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/iothub/)
* [Azure IoT C SDK source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c)
