# Azure IoT Device SDKs Platform Support

Microsoft strives to continually expand the universe of Azure IoT Hub capable devices. Microsoft publishes open source device SDKs on GitHub to help connect devices to Azure IoT Hub and the Device Provisioning Service. The device SDKs are available for C, .NET (C#), Java, Node.js, and Python, and Microsoft performs testing to ensure their operation on a variety of popular platforms. A platform is typically defined by a combination of operating system, microprocessor architecture, compiler or framework version, and transport layer security (TLS) library.

In addition to the device SDKs, Microsoft provides several other avenues to empower customers and developers to connect their devices to Azure IoT:

* Microsoft collaborates with several partner companies to help them publish semiconductor development kits, based on the Azure IoT C SDK, for their hardware platforms.

* Microsoft works with Microsoft Trusted Partners to provide an ever-expanding set of devices that have been tested and certified for Azure IoT.

* Microsoft provides a platform abstraction layer (PAL) in the Azure IoT Hub Device C SDK that helps developers to easily port the SDK to their platform.

This topic provides information about the Microsoft SDKs and the platforms they are tested against, as well as each of the other options listed above.

## Microsoft SDKs and device platform support

Microsoft publishes open source SDKs on GitHub for the following languages: C, .NET (C#), Node.js, Java, and Python. The SDKs and their dependencies are listed in this section. The SDKs are supported on any device platform that satisfies these dependencies.

For each of the listed SDKs, Microsoft:

* Continuously builds and runs end-to-end tests against the master branch of the relevant SDK in GitHub on several popular platforms.  To provide test coverage across different compiler versions, we generally test against the latest LTS version and the most popular version.

* Provides installation guidance or installation packages if applicable.

* Fully supports the SDKs on GitHub with open source code, a path for customer contributions, and product team engagement with GitHub issues.

## Partner supported semiconductor development kits

Microsoft works with various partners to provide semiconductor development kits for several other microprocessor architectures. These partners have ported the Azure IoT C SDK to their platform. Partners create and maintain the platform abstraction layer (PAL) of the SDK. Microsoft works with these partners to provide extended support.

## Porting the Microsoft Azure IoT C SDK

If your device platform is not covered by one of the previous sections, you can consider porting the Azure IoT C SDK. Porting the C SDK primarily involves implementing the platform abstraction layer (PAL) of the SDK. The PAL defines primitives that provide the glue between your device and higher-level functions in the SDK. For more information, see [Porting Guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility/blob/master/devdoc/porting_guide.md).

## Microsoft partners and certified Azure IoT devices

Microsoft works with a number of partners to continually expand the Azure IoT universe with Azure IoT tested and certified devices.

* To browse Azure IoT certified devices, see [Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT Device Catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/).

* To learn more about Microsoft trusted partners or to learn how to become a Microsoft trusted partner, see [Microsoft Azure Certified Internet of Things Trusted Partners](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/certified-iot-partners/).
