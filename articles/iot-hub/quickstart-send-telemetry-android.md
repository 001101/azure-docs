# As a developer new to IoT Hub, I need to see how IoT Hub sends telemetry from an Android device to an IoT hub and how to read that telemetry data from the hub using a back-end application.

# Quickstart: Send IoT telemetry from an Android device

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-quickstarts-1-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-quickstarts-1-selector.md)]

IoT Hub is an Azure service that enables you to ingest high volumes of telemetry from your IoT devices into the cloud for storage or processing. In this quickstart, you send telemetry from a simulated device application, through IoT Hub, to a back-end application for processing.

The quickstart uses a pre-written Android application to send the telemetry. The telemetry will be read from the IoT Hub using the Azure Cloud Shell. Before you run the application, you create an IoT hub and register a device with the hub.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

--- Add Android Studio & Android SDK requirements ---

Download the sample Android project from https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/tree/master/device/iot-device-samples/android-sample.

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-quickstarts-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-quickstarts-create-hub.md)]

## Register a device

A device must be registered with your IoT hub before it can connect. In this quickstart, you use the Azure Cloud Shell to register a simulated device.

1. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to add the IoT Hub CLI extension and to create the device identity. 

   **YourIoTHubName** : Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

   **MyAndroidDevice** : This is the name given for the registered device. Use MyAndroidDevice as shown. If you choose a different name for your device, you will also need to use that name throughout this article, and update the device name in the sample applications before you run them.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension add --name azure-cli-iot-ext
    az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyAndroidDevice
    ```

2. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to get the _device connection string_ for the device you just registered:
    **YourIoTHubName** : Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyAndroidDevice --output table
    ```

    Make a note of the device connection string, which looks like:

   `HostName={YourIoTHubName}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=MyNodeDevice;SharedAccessKey={YourSharedAccessKey}`

    You use this value later in the quickstart.

3. You also need the _Event Hubs-compatible endpoint_, _Event Hubs-compatible path_, and _iothubowner primary key_ from your IoT hub to enable the back-end application to connect to your IoT hub and retrieve the messages. The following commands retrieve these values for your IoT hub:

     **YourIoTHubName** : Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub show --query properties.eventHubEndpoints.events.endpoint --name YourIoTHubName

    az iot hub show --query properties.eventHubEndpoints.events.path --name YourIoTHubName

    az iot hub policy show --name iothubowner --query primaryKey --hub-name YourIoTHubName
    ```

    Make a note of these three values, which you use later in the quickstart.

## Send simulated telemetry

--- Update this section for android sample code ---

The simulated device application connects to a device-specific endpoint on your IoT hub and sends simulated temperature and humidity telemetry.


## Read the telemetry from your hub

--- Update this section with new screenshot ---

In this section, you will use the Azure Cloud Shell with the [IoT extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-iot-ext/iot?view=azure-cli-latest) to monitor the device messages that are sent by the simulated device.

1. Using the Azure Cloud Shell, run the following command to connect and read messages from your IoT hub:

   **YourIoTHubName** : Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub monitor-events --hub-name YourIoTHubName --output table
    ```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've setup an IoT hub, registered a device, sent simulated telemetry to the hub using an Android application, and read the telemetry from the hub using the Azure Cloud Shell.

To learn how to control your simulated device from a back-end application, continue to the next quickstart.
