# 403006 DeviceMaximumActiveFileUploadLimitExceeded

This article describes the causes and solutions for **403006 DeviceMaximumActiveFileUploadLimitExceeded** errors.

## Symptoms

When trying to initiate a file upload request, the request fails with the error code **403006** and a message "Number of active file upload requests cannot exceed 10".

## Cause

Each device client is limited to [10 concurrent file uploads](./iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling.md#other-limits). 

Most likely, you're exceeding the limit because IoT Hub wasn't notified that previous file uploads are completed, commonly as a result of flaky network where the device frequently loses connection and fails to complete the upload.

## Solution

Ensure the device can promptly [notify IoT Hub file upload completion](./iot-hub-devguide-file-upload.md#notify-iot-hub-of-a-completed-file-upload). Then, try [reducing the SAS token TTL for file upload configuration](iot-hub-configure-file-upload.md).

## Next steps

To learn more about file uploads, see [Upload files with IoT Hub](./iot-hub-devguide-file-upload.md) and [Configure IoT Hub file uploads using the Azure portal](./iot-hub-configure-file-upload.md).
