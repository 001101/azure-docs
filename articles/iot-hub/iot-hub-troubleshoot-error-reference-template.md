# Error reference template

The heading of the problem resolution article should use the message that the customer sees if possible, key words from the message, or key words that describe the symptom that the customer is experiencing.

The article should begin with a concise description of the problem to be resolved. The beginning sentences should include as many of the key words from the message or symptoms as possible. The information in the introduction should help the customer decide whether the information applies to the issue that they are encountering.

## Prerequisites

If there are steps that the customer should complete or tools that need to be downloaded before continuing through the troubleshooting guidance, they should be described in this section.

## Symptoms

Precisely describe what the customer should be experiencing when encountering the problem. If the title can't contain the complete message, expand on it here. If there is relevant general troubleshooting information available, link to it from here.

## Cause

Describe the cause of the symptoms. It is possible that there could be several causes for a problem. List each one as an H3 with Cause # where # is a successive number of possible causes.

## Solution

List the steps that should be taken to resolve the problem. It is possible that there could be several solutions for a problem. If there are multiple solutions, put them in the order of complexity and provide instructions on how to choose from among them. List each one as an H3 with Solution # where # is a successive number of possible solutions. If workaround information is available to temporarily alleviate the symptoms, list them in this section.

## Next steps

Include this section if there are 1 -3 concrete, highly relevant next steps the user should take. Delete if there are no next steps. This is not a place for a list of links. If you include links to next steps, make sure to include text to explain why the next steps are relevant or important.
