# 400027 ConnectionForcefullyClosedOnNewConnection

This article describes the causes and solutions for **400027 ConnectionForcefullyClosedOnNewConnection** errors.

## Symptoms

Your device-to-cloud twin operation (such as read or patch reported properties) or direct method invocation fails with the error code **400027**. 

## Cause

The device created a new connection to IoT Hub, so the previous connection was closed. This happens when more than one client tries to connect to IoT Hub using the same connection string.

## Solution

Ensure that each client connects to IoT Hub using its own authentication credentials, such as a connection string.
