# Get started on setting up X.509 security in your Azure IoT hub

This tutorial describes the tasks you need to do to set up the CA-based X.509 based security in Azure IoT Hub, with the help of a simulated script. 

## Prerequisites
This tutorial requires that you have created an IoT hub with your Azure subscription. See [Create an IoT hub through portal](iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) for detailed steps to create a hub. 

## Task 1: Create X.509 certificates

## Task 2: Upload X.509 certificates through the portal
<a id="uploadcerts"></a>

## Task 3: Register your device with your IoT hub
<a id="registerdevice"></a>

## Task 4: Device connects to the hub
<a id="deviceconnects"></a>
