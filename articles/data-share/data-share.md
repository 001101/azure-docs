# Data Shares 

A Data Share is a collection of datasets sharing as a single entity. Typically, a data provider creates a data share containing datasets from Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Gen2. The data provider then adds recipients to the data share. Once a recipient accepts a data share and creates a share subscription, they become data consumers.
