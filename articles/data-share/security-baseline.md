# Azure security baseline for Azure Data Share

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Data Share. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Data Share. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Data Share have been excluded. To see how Azure Data Share completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Data Share security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33164.).

**Guidance**: Ingest logs related to Azure Data Share via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by data share resources. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage accounts for long term and archival storage.

- [How to collect platform logs and metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md) 

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33165.).

**Guidance**: Activity logs, which are automatically available, contain all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your Azure Data Share resources except read operations (GET). Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

Enable diagnostic logs for Azure Data Share, specifically the diagnostic logs for MicrosoftDataShareSentShareSnapshotsLog &amp; MicrosoftDataShareReceivedShareSnapshotsLog. These logs will enable you to capture key information like synchronization start time, end time, status and other details. These logs can be critical for later investigating security incidents and performing forensic exercises.

### 2.5: Configure security log storage retention

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33167.).

**Guidance**: Ensure that any storage accounts or Log Analytics workspaces used for storing Azure Data Share logs has the log retention period set according to your organization's compliance regulations.

### 2.6: Monitor and review Logs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33168.).

**Guidance**: Analyze and monitor logs related to Azure Data Share resources for anomalous behavior and regularly review the results. Use Azure Monitor and a Log Analytics workspace to review logs and perform queries on log data.

Alternatively, you can enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third party SIEM.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33176.).

**Guidance**: Azure Data Share supports SSO authentication with Azure Active Directory. Reduce the number of identities and credentials users must manage by enabling SSO for the service with your organization's pre-existing identities.
