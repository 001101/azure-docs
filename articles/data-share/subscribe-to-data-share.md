# Tutorial: Accept and receive data using Azure Data Share Preview

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * How to accept an Azure Data Share Preview invitation
> * Create an Azure Data Share Preview account
> * Specify a destination for your data
> * Create a subscription to your data share for scheduled refresh

## Prerequisites
Before you can accept a data share invitation, you must provision a number of Azure resources which are listed below. 

Ensure that all pre-requisites are complete before accepting a data share invitation. 

* Azure Subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* An Azure Storage account: If you don't already have one, you can create an [Azure Storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account). 
* A Data Share invitation: An invitation from Microsoft Azure with a subject titled "Azure Data Share invitation from **<yourdataprovider@domain.com>**".

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Locate the invitation that was sent to you by the Data Provider 

Check your inbox for an invitation from your data provider. The invitation is from Microsoft Azure, titled **Azure Data Share invitation from <yourdataprovider@domain.com>**. Take note of the share name to ensure you're accepting the correct share if there are multiple invitations. 

Click on **View invitation** to see your invitation in Azure. This takes you to your Received Shares view.

Select the share you would like to view. 

## Accept the invitation
Make sure all fields are reviewed, including the **Terms of Use**. If you agree to the terms of use, you'll be required to check the box to indicate you agree. 

Under *Target Data Share Account*, select the Subscription and Resource Group that you'll be deploying your Data Share into. 

For the **Data Share Account** field, select **Create new** if you don't have an existing Data Share account. Otherwise, select an existing Data Share account that you'd like to accept your data share into. 

For the *Received Share Name* field, you may leave the default specified by the Data Provide, or specify a new name for the received share. 

Once you've agreed to the terms of use and specified a location for your share, click on *Accept and Configure*. 

## Configure target storage for your Data Share
Under *Target Storage Settings*, select the Subscription, Resource group, and storage account that you'd like to receive your data into. 

Your Data Provider may have offered a synchronization setting for you to subscribe to. To receive regular refreshes of your data, make sure you enable the synchronization setting. If you don't see one, contact your Data Provider. 

## Trigger a snapshot
You can trigger a snapshot in the Received Shares -> Details tab by selecting **Trigger snapshot**. Here, you can trigger a full or  incremental snapshot of your data. If it is your first time receiving data from your data provider, select full copy. 

## Enable a synchronization schedule
To enable or disable a synchronization schedule, navigate to Received Shares -> Synchronization Schedule and select the synchronization interval that you would like to enable. 

Click **Enable** to enable a synchronization schedule, or if you'd like to stop data from being refreshed, click **Disable**. 

## View a history of your snapshots
To view a history of your snapshots, navigate to Received Shares -> History. Here you'll find a history of all snapshots that were generated for the past 60 days. 

You are now ready to consume your data. 

To navigate to the data that has been shared with you, select Received Shares -> Datasets. Under **Path**, you'll see a link to the path that contains your received data. Wait until a snapshot has been successful before you can see your data. Information about the status of your snapshot can be seen in the Details tab, or the History tab.
