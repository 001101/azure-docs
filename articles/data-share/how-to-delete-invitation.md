# How To: Delete an invitation to a recipient before they accept it

> This will prevent the recipient from creating a share subscription, and they will never receive the shared data. If you delete the invitation to a consumer it won't do anything.

1. Navigate to your **Data Share Account** and go to **Sent Shares**.
2. Select the share from which you would like to delete a recipient. 
3. Click on the **Invitations** tab. Listed here are all of the recipients of invitations to this data share. 
4. Check the boxes next to the recipients whose invitations you would like to delete.
5. Click **Delete**
