To work with Azure Data Share, you will first need to setup a data share account.  You can complete this task through the Azure portal, or you can execute a single Azure CLI command.

```axure-cli
az datashare account create --location "West US 2" --tags tag1=Red tag2=White --name MyAccount --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```

Your next step is to create the actual data share.

```axure-cli
az datashare create --account-name MyAccount --resource-group MyResourceGroup --description "share description" --share-kind "CopyBased" --terms "Confidential" --name MyShare
```
