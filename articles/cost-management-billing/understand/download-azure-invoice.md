# View and download your Microsoft Azure invoice

You can download your invoice in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or have it sent in email. If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer), you can't download your organization's invoice. Invoice is sent to whoever is set up to receive invoice for the enrollment.

## Understand when invoices are generated for your Azure account

An invoice is generated based on the type of your billing account. To learn more about billing accounts and identify the type of your billing account, see [View billing accounts in Azure portal](../manage/view-all-accounts.md).

### Invoices for Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) billing accounts:

A billing account for a Microsoft Online Services Program is created when you sign up for Azure through the Azure website. For example, when you sign up for an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/), [account with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or as a [Visual studio subscriber](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/).

Customers in select regions, who sign up through the Azure website for an [account with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) can have a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check your billing account type](../manage/view-all-accounts.md#check-the-type-of-your-account) before following the instructions in this article. 

Your billing account for a Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) can have these invoices:

*Azure service charges*: An invoice is generated for each Azure subscription that contains Azure resources used within that subscription. The invoice contains charges for a billing period, which depends on the day the subscription was created. For example, John creates *Azure sub 1* on 5 March and *Azure sub 2* on 10 March, the invoice for *Azure sub 1* will have charges from fifth day of a month to fourth day of next month and invoice for Azure sub 2* will have charges from tenth day of a month to ninth day of next month. The invoices for all Azure subscriptions are generated on the day the account was created. In the scenario above, if John created his account on 2 February, the invoices for both *Azure sub 1* and *Azure sub 2* will be generated on second day of each month.   

*Azure marketplace, reservations, and spot VMs*: An invoice is generated for reservations, marketplace products, and spot VMs purchased using a subscription. The invoice respective charges from the previous month. For example, John purchased a reservation on 1 March and another reservation on 30 March, a single invoice will be generated for both the reservations in April. The invoice for Azure marketplace, reservations, and spot VMs are always generated around ninth day of the month. 

*Azure support plan*:  An invoice is generated each month for your support plan subscription. The invoice is generated 1 to 2 days from the day the support plan is purchased. For example, John purchased a developer support plan subscription on 2 March, he'll get an invoice on either third or fourth day of each month until the support plan is active.

### Invoices for Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) and Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) billing accounts:

A billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement is created when your organization works with a Microsoft representative to sign a Microsoft Customer Agreement. Some customers in select regions, who sign up through the Azure website for an [account with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) may have a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement as well. For more information, see [Get started with your billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement](../understand/mca-overview.md).

A billing account for a Microsoft Partner Agreement is created for Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners to manage their customers in the new commerce experience. Partners need to have at least one customer with an [Azure plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/purchase-azure-plan) to manage their billing account in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Get started with your billing account for Microsoft Partner Agreement](../understand/mpa-overview.md).

A monthly invoice is generated at the beginning of the month for each billing profile in your account. The invoice contains respective charges for all Azure subscriptions and other purchases from the previous month. For example, John created *Azure sub 1* on 5 March, *Azure sub 2* on 10 March, and purchased *Azure support 1* subscription on 28 March using *Billing profile 1*. John will get a single invoice in the beginning of April that will contains charges for both Azure subscriptions and support plan.

## <a name="noinvoice"></a> Why you might not see an invoice

There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:

- It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure. 

- Azure bills you a few days after the end of your billing period. So, an invoice might not have been generated yet.

- You don't have permission to view invoices. If you have an MCA or MPA billing account, you must have an Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager role on a billing profile or an Owner, Contributor, or Reader role on the billing account to view invoices. For other subscriptions, you might not see the invoices if you aren't the Account Administrator. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](../manage/manage-billing-access.md).

- If you have a billing account for Microsoft Online Services Program (MOSP) and you signed up for an Azure Free Account or a subscription with a monthly credit amount, you only get an invoice when you exceed the monthly credit amount. If you have a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or a Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), you always receive an invoice.
