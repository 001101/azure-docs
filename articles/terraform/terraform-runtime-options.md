# Azure Terraform development environments

Terraform works great from a Bash command line such as macOS Terminal or Bash on Windows or Linux. Running your Terraform configurations in the Bash experience of the [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview) has some unique advantages that simplify development and getting started. 

This concepts article details exactly what's provided in the Cloud Shell for Terraform development and the best way to set up a development workflow with the Cloud Shell.

## Using Azure Cloud Shell with Terraform

Setting up Azure Cloud Shell is documented [here](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) and takes about fives minutes.  As part of setting up Azure Cloud Shell for the first time, you give the ok to set up storage. The following screenshots show examples of what you get:

A new storage account in a resource group named something like "cloud-shell-storage-region":
![New Storage Account](https://golivearmstorage.blob.core.windows.net/public/newStorageAccount.png)

The contents look like this initially in the portal:
![Storage Contents Portal](https://golivearmstorage.blob.core.windows.net/public/storageAccountContents.png)

And this is what it looks like in bash:
![Storage Contents Bash](https://golivearmstorage.blob.core.windows.net/public/storageAccountContentsSSH.png)

Terraform works out of the box, along with Go and the Azure CLI v2.0 toolset. You are automatically authenticated by the integration with Azure Cloud Shell to work with resources inside the same Azure subscription.

Resulting in:

Your state persists in the clouddrive.

## Using Terminal on Mac with Terraform

Instructions for installing Terraform are [here.](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) Select the package for your OS (Mac). It downloads as a single executable file in your Downloads folder. Once you have it where you want it, add that folder to your path. Check your installation by typing 'terraform' at the prompt.

### Configuring your environment

Each Terraform module requires credentials to access your Azure subscription. These lines may be added to your main.tf:

```tf
# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "..."
  client_id       = "..."
  client_secret   = "..."
  tenant_id       = "..."
}
```

Alternately, you could use environment variables to store your credentials and reference them in your `.tf` file. Details are documented [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#environment-variables).

A third alternative is to use a variables file. Put the variables file into your `.gitignore` so it doesn't get checked into source control. Details are [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-files).

You will probably benefit from installing the Azure CLI v2.0 as well. It's a great tool for testing things using lower-level capabilities and for checking your work, along with the using the portal for that purpose. Instructions for installation are [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

## Using Bash on Windows with Terraform

There are a few ways to run Bash on Windows. The installation details are [here.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide)

To enter the Bash command prompt, open a command shell, type 'bash' and press enter. Follow the [instructions](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) to install Terraform on Linux from within Bash.

Follow the instructions in the section above: [Configuring your Environment]().

## Use a Linux VM

Instructions for installing Terraform are [here.](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) Select the package for your OS (Linux). Reference the section above to configure your environment: [Configuring your Environment]().
