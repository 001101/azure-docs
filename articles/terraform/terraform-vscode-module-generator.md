# Tutorial: Create a Terraform base template in Azure using Yeoman

[Terraform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/terraform/) provides a way to easily create infrastructure on Azure. [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) greatly eases the job of the module developer in creating Terraform modules while providing an excellent *best practices* framework.

In this article, you learn the following:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a base Terraform template using the Yeoman module generator.
> * Test the Terraform template using two different methods.
> * Run the Terraform module using a Docker file.
> * Run the Terraform module natively in Azure Cloud Shell.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- **Visual Studio Code**: We will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://www.bing.com/search?q=visual+studio+code+download&form=EDGSPH&mkt=en-us&httpsmsn=1&refig=dffc817cbc4f4cb4b132a8e702cc19a3&sp=3&ghc=1&qs=LS&pq=visual+studio+code&sk=LS1&sc=8-18&cvid=dffc817cbc4f4cb4b132a8e702cc19a3&cc=US&setlang=en-US) to examine files created by the Yeoman generator. However, you may use any code editor of your choice.
- **Terraform**: You will need an installation of [Terraform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/terraform-install-configure ) to run the module created by Yeoman.
- **Docker**: We will be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to run the module created by the Yeoman generator. (If you prefer, you may use Ruby in place of Docker to run the sample module.)
- **Go programming language**: You will need an installation of [Go](https://golang.org/) because the test cases generated by Yeoman are written in Go.

>[!NOTE]
>Most of the procedures in this tutorial involve command line entries. The steps described here apply to all operating systems and command line tools. In our examples, we have chosen to use PowerShell for local environment and Git Bash for cloud shell environment.

## Prepare your environment

### Install Node.js

To use Terraform in the Cloud Shell, you need to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 6.0+.

>[!NOTE]
>To verify that Node.js is installed, open a terminal window and enter `node --version`.

### Install Yeoman

Run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

![Install Yeoman](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-npm-install-yo.png)

### Install the Yeoman template for Terraform module

Run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g generator-az-terra-module
```

![Install generator-az-terra-module](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-pm-install-generator-module.png)

To verify that Yeoman is installed, run the following command:

```bash
yo --version
```

### Create a directory for the Yeoman-generated module

The Yeoman template generates files in the current directory. For this reason, you need to create a directory.

This empty directory is required to be put under $GOPATH/src. For more information about this path, see the article [Setting GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH).

1. Navigate to the parent directory from which to create a new directory.

1. Run the following command replacing the placeholder. For this example, a directory name of `GeneratorDocSample` is used.

    ```bash
    mkdir <new-directory-name>
    ```

    ![mkdir](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-mkdir-GeneratorDocSample.png)

1. Navigate to the new directory:

    ```bash
    cd <new-directory-name>
    ```

    ![Navigate to your new directory](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-cd-GeneratorDocSample.png)

## Create a base module template

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    yo az-terra-module
    ```

1. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the following information:

    - **Terraform module project Name** - A value of `doc-sample-module` is used for the example.

        ![Project name](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-project-name.png)       


    - **Would you like to include the Docker image file?** - Enter `y`. If you select `n`, the generated module code will support running only in native mode.

        ![Include Docker image file?](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-include-docker-image-file.png) 

1. List the directory contents to view the resulting files that are created:

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

    ![List created files](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-ls-GeneratorDocSample-files.png)

## Review the generated module code

1. Launch Visual Studio Code

1. From the menu bar, select **File > Open Folder** and select the folder you created.

    ![Visual Studio Code](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-open-in-vscode.png)

In this article, we will be using the main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf files as created by the Yeoman module generator. However, when creating your own modules, you would be editing these files to accommodate the functionality of your Terraform module. For a more in-depth discussion of these files and their usage, see [Terratest in Terraform Modules.](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/VSJava/_git/Terraform?path=%2FTerratest%20Introduction.md&version=GBmaster)

The following files were created by the Yeoman module generator:

- `main.tf` - Defines a module called *random-shuffle*. The input is a *string_list*. The output is the count of the permutations.
- `variables.tf` - Defines the input and output variables used by the module.
- `outputs.tf` - Defines what the module outputs. Here, it is the value returned by **random_shuffle**, which is a built-in, Terraform module.
- `Rakefile` - Defines the build steps. These steps include:
    - `build` - Validates the formatting of the main.tf file.
    - `unit` -  The generated module skeleton does not include code for a unit test. If you want to specify a unit test scenario, you would you add that code here.
    - `e2e` - Runs an end-to-end test of the module.
- `test`
    - Test cases are written in Go.
    - All codes in test are end-to-end tests.
    - End-to-end tests try to use Terraform to provision all of the items defined under `fixture` and then compare the output in the `template_output.go` code with the pre-defined expected values.
    - `Gopkg.lock` and `Gopkg.toml`: Defines the dependencies. 

## Test your new Terraform module using a Docker file

This section shows how to test a Terraform module using a Docker file.

>[!NOTE]
>In our example, we are running the module as a local module, and not actually touching Azure.

### Confirm Docker is installed and running

From a command prompt, enter `docker version`.

![Docker version](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-docker-version.png)

The resulting output confirms that Docker is installed.

To confirm that Docker is actually running, enter `docker info`.

![Docker info](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-docker-info.png)

### Set up a Docker container

1. From a command prompt, enter

    `docker build --build-arg BUILD_ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID= --build-arg BUILD_ARM_CLIENT_ID= --build-arg BUILD_ARM_CLIENT_SECRET= --build-arg BUILD_ARM_TENANT_ID= -t terra-mod-example .`.

    The message **Successfully built** will be displayed.

    ![Successfully built](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-successfully-built.png)

1. From the command prompt, enter `docker image ls`.

    You will see your newly created module *terra-mod-example* listed.

    ![Repository results](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-repository-results.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >The module's name, *terra-mod-example*, was specified in the command you entered in step 1, above.

1. Enter `docker run -it terra-mod-example /bin/sh`.

    You are now running in Docker and can list the file by entering `ls`.

    ![List Docker file](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-list-docker-file.png)

### Build the module

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

    Wait for the **Bundle complete** message, then continue with the next step.

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    rake build
    ```

    ![Rake build](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-rake-build.png)

### Run the end-to-end test

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    rake e2e
    ```

1. After a few moments, the **PASS** message will appear.

    ![PASS](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-pass.png)

1. Enter `exit` to complete the test and exit the Docker environment.

## Use Yeoman generator to create and test a module in Cloud Shell

In this section, you will use the Yeoman generator to create and test a module in Cloud Shell. Using Cloud Shell instead of using a Docker file greatly simplifies the process. Using Cloud Shell, the following products are all pre-installed:

- You do not need to install Node.js
- You do not need to install Yeoman
- You do not need to install Terraform

### Start a Cloud Shell session

1. Start an Azure Cloud Shell session via either the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), [shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com), or the [Azure mobile app](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-portal/mobile-app/).

1. **The Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell** page opens. Select **Bash (Linux)**.

    ![Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-welcome-to-azure-cloud-shell.png)

1. If you have not already set up an Azure storage account, the following screen appears. Select **Create storage**.

    ![You have no storage mounted](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-you-have-no-storage-mounted.png)

1. Azure Cloud Shell launches in the shell you previously selected and displays information for the cloud drive it just created for you.

    ![Your cloud drive has been created](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-your-cloud-drive-has-been-created-in.png)

### Prepare a directory to hold your Terraform module

1. At this point, Cloud Shell will have already configured GOPATH in your environment variables for you. To see the path, enter `go env`.

1. Create the $GOPATH directory, if one does not already exist: Enter `mkdir ~/go`.

1. Create a directory within the $GOPATH directory. This directory is used to hold the different project directories created in this example. 

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/go/src
    ```

1. Create a directory to hold your Terraform module replacing the placeholder. For this example, a directory name of `my-module-name` is used.

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/go/src/<your-module-name>
    ```

1. Navigate to your module directory: 

    ```bash
    cd ~/go/src/<your-module-name>
    ```

### Create and test your Terraform module

1. Run the following command and follow the instructions. When asked if you want to create the Docker files, you enter `N`.

    ```bash
    yo az-terra-module
    ```

1. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

1. Run the following command to build the module:

    ```bash
    rake build
    ```

    ![Rake build](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-rake-build.png)

1. Run the following command to run the text:

    ```bash
    rake e2e
    ```

    ![Test pass results](media/terraform-vscode-module-generator/ymg-pass.png)
