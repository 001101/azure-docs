# Azure Australia Documentation Overview

## Introduction to Azure Australia Documentation

There are specific Australian Government requirements for connecting to, consuming, and operating within [Microsoft Azure Australia](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/australia/) for Australian Government data and systems. The resources on this page also provide general guidance applicable to all customers with a specific focus on secure configuration and operation.

Microsoft Azure came to life in 2010 to provide an operating system in the cloud – a platform on which innovators could build applications faster and more easily. In 2014, that platform came to Australia, housed in data centres in Sydney and Melbourne. We began with a clear focus on security, resilience and operations, and a commitment to exceed our clients’ expectations. In August 2017, we announced that Microsoft and CDC Data Centres had entered a strategic partnership to deliver new Azure Regions located in Canberra – the Australia Central Regions. The Australia Central and Australia Central 2 regions are purposely designed to meet the needs of government and critical national infrastructure, and offer specialised connectivity and flexibility so you can locate your systems beside the cloud, with levels of security and resilience only expected of Secret-classified networks. Azure Australia is a platform for the digital transformation of government and critical national infrastructure – and the only mission-critical cloud available in Australia designed for your needs.

Refer to the Australia page of the [Microsoft Service Trust Portal](https://aka.ms/au-irap) for current information on the Azure Australia Information Security Registered Assessor (IRAP) Assessments, certification and inclusion on the Certified Cloud Services List (CCSL). On the Australia page you will also find other Microsoft advice specific to Government and Critical Infrastructure providers.

## Principles for Securing Customer Data in Azure Australia

Azure Australia provides a range of features and services that you can use to build cloud solutions to meet your regulated/controlled data needs. A compliant customer solution is nothing more than the effective implementation of out-of-the-box Azure Australia capabilities, coupled with a solid data security practice.

When you host a solution in Azure Australia, Microsoft handles many of these requirements at the cloud infrastructure level.

The following diagram shows the Azure defence-in-depth model. For example, Microsoft provides basic cloud infrastructure DDoS, along with customer capabilities such as security appliances or premium DDoS services for customer-specific application needs.

This page outlines the foundational principles for securing your services and applications, with guidance and best practices on how to apply these principles. In other words, how customers should make smart use of Azure Australia to meet the obligations and responsibilities that are required for a solution that handles Government sensitive and classified information.

The overarching principles for securing customer data are:

* Protecting data using encryption
* Managing secrets
* Restricting data access

## Protecting Customer Data Using Encryption

Mitigating risk and meeting regulatory obligations are driving the increasing focus and importance of data encryption. Use an effective encryption implementation to enhance current network and application security measures—and lower the overall risk of your cloud environment.

### Encryption at rest

The encryption of data at rest applies to the protection of customer data held in disk storage. There are several ways encryption might be applied:

|Service/Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Storage Service Encryption|Azure Storage Service Encryption is enabled at the storage account level, resulting in block blobs and page blobs being automatically encrypted when written to Azure Storage. When you read the data from Azure Storage, it will be decrypted by the storage service before being returned. Use SSE to secure your data without having to modify or add code to any applications.|
|Azure Disk Encryption|Use Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt the OS disks and data disks used by an Azure Virtual Machine. Integration with Azure Key Vault gives you control and helps you manage disk encryption keys.|
|Client-Side Encryption|Client-Side Encryption is built into the Java and the .NET storage client libraries, which can utilize Azure Key Vault APIs, making it straightforward to implement. Use Azure Key Vault to gain access to the secrets in Azure Key Vault for specific individuals using Azure Active Directory.|
|Encryption in transit|The basic encryption available for connectivity to Azure Australia supports Transport Level Security (TLS) 1.2 protocol, and X.509 certificates. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Level 1 cryptographic algorithms are also used for infrastructure network connections between Azure Australia data centers.  Windows Server 2016, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8.1, and Azure File shares can use SMB 3.0 for encryption between the VM and the file share. Use Client-Side Encryption to encrypt the data before it's transferred into storage in a client application, and to decrypt the data after it's transferred out of storage.|

### Best practices for Encryption

* IaaS VMs: Use Azure Disk Encryption. Turn on Storage Service Encryption to encrypt the VHD files that are used to back up those disks in Azure Storage, but this only encrypts newly written data. This means that, if you create a VM and then enable Storage Service Encryption on the storage account that holds the VHD file, only the changes will be encrypted, not the original VHD file.
* Client-Side Encryption: This is the most secure method for encrypting your data, because it encrypts it before transit, and encrypts the data at rest. However, it does require that you add code to your applications using storage, which you might not want to do. In those cases, you can use HTTPs for your data in transit, and Storage Service Encryption to encrypt the data at rest. Client-Side Encryption also involves more load on the client—you have to account for this in your scalability plans, especially if you're encrypting and transferring large amounts of data.

For more information on the encryption options in Azure, see the [Storage Security Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-security-guide).

## Protecting Customer Data by Managing Secrets

Secure key management is essential for protecting data in the cloud. Customers should strive to simplify key management and maintain control of keys used by cloud applications and services to encrypt data.

### Best Practices for Managing Secrets

* Use Key Vault to minimize the risks of secrets being exposed through hard-coded configuration files, scripts, or in source code. Azure Key Vault encrypts keys (such as the encryption keys for Azure Disk Encryption) and secrets (such as passwords), by storing them in FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs). For added assurance, you can import or generate keys in these HSMs.
* Application code and templates should only contain URI references to the secrets (which means the actual secrets are not in code, configuration, or source code repositories). This prevents key phishing attacks on internal or external repos, such as harvest-bots in GitHub.
* Utilize strong RBAC controls within Key Vault. If a trusted operator leaves the company or transfers to a new group within the company, they should be prevented from being able to access the secrets.

## Isolation to Restrict Data Access

Isolation is all about using boundaries, segmentation, and containers to limit data access to only authorized users, services, and applications. For example, the separation between tenants is an essential security mechanism for multitenant cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure. Logical isolation helps prevent one tenant from interfering with the operations of any other tenant.

### Environment Isolation

The Azure Australia environment is a physical instance that is separate from the rest of Microsoft's network. This is achieved through a series of physical and logical controls that include the following:  Securing of physical barriers using biometric devices and cameras.  Use of specific credentials and multi-factor authentication by Microsoft personnel requiring logical access to the production environment.  All service infrastructure for Azure Australia is located within the United States.

#### Per-Customer Isolation

Azure implements network access control and segregation through VLAN isolation, ACLs, load balancers, and IP filters

Customers can further isolate their resources across subscriptions, resource groups, virtual networks, and subnets.
