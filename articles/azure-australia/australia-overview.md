# What is Azure Australia

In 2014, Azure was launched in Australia, with two regions; Australia East (Sydney) and Australia Southeast (Melbourne). In April 2018 we two new Azure Regions located in Canberra – Australia Central and Australia Central 2 launched. The Australia Central and Australia Central 2 regions are purposely designed to meet the needs of government and critical national infrastructure, and offer specialised connectivity and flexibility so you can locate your systems beside the cloud, with levels of security and resilience only expected of Secret-classified networks. Azure Australia is a platform for the digital transformation of government and critical national infrastructure – and the only mission-critical cloud available in Australia designed specifically for those needs.

There are specific Australian Government requirements for connecting to, consuming, and operating within [Microsoft Azure Australia](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/australia/) for Australian Government data and systems. The resources on this page also provide general guidance applicable to all customers with a specific focus on secure configuration and operation.

Refer to the Australia page of the [Microsoft Service Trust Portal](https://aka.ms/au-irap) for current information on the Azure Australia Information Security Registered Assessor (IRAP) Assessments, certification and inclusion on the Certified Cloud Services List (CCSL). On the Australia page you will also find other Microsoft advice specific to Government and Critical Infrastructure providers.

## Principles for securing customer data in Azure Australia

Azure Australia provides a range of features and services that you can use to build cloud solutions to meet your regulated/controlled data needs. A compliant customer solution is nothing more than the effective implementation of out-of-the-box Azure Australia capabilities, coupled with a solid data security practice.

When you host a solution in Azure Australia, Microsoft handles many of these requirements at the cloud infrastructure level.

The following diagram shows the Azure defence-in-depth model. For example, Microsoft provides basic cloud infrastructure DDoS, along with customer capabilities such as security appliances or premium DDoS services for customer-specific application needs.

This page outlines the foundational principles for securing your services and applications, with guidance and best practices on how to apply these principles. In other words, how customers should make smart use of Azure Australia to meet the obligations and responsibilities that are required for a solution that handles Government sensitive and classified information.



## Next Steps

The first step to using Azure Australia is to establish secure connectivity.

Another key step for Government agencies is the establishment of perimeter security capabilities. The How tos provide guidance to agencies to do it.
