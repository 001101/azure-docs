# Enable diagnostics logs for Azure Relay
When you start using your Azure Relay namespace, you might want to monitor how and when your namespace is created, deleted, or accessed. This article provides an overview of all the operational and diagnostics logs that are available.

You can view two types of logs for Azure Relay:

- [Activity logs](../azure-monitor/platform/platform-logs-overview.md): These logs have information about operations performed against your namespace in the Azure portal or through Azure Resource Manager template. These logs are always enabled. For example: "Create or update namespace", "Create or update hybrid connection". 
- [Diagnostic logs](../azure-monitor/platform/platform-logs-overview.md): You can configure diagnostic logs for a richer view of everything that happens with operations and actions that are conducted against your namespace by using the API, or through management clients on the language SDK.

## View activity logs
To view activity logs for your Azure Relay namespace, switch to the **Activity log** page in the Azure portal.

## Enable diagnostic logs
Only one category: Hybrid Connections

To enable diagnostics logs, do the following:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your Azure Relay namespace and then, under **Monitoring**, select  **Diagnostic settings**.
1. On the **Diagnostics settings** page, select **Add diagnostic setting**.  

   ![The "Add diagnostic setting" link](./media/diagnostic-logs/add-diagnostic-setting.png)

1. Configure the diagnostics settings by doing the following:
    1. In the **Name** box, enter a name for the diagnostics settings.  
    2. Select **HybridConnectionsEvent** for the type of log. It's the only type supported. 
    3. Select one of the following three **destinations** for your diagnostics logs:  
        1. If you select **Archive to a storage account**, configure the storage account where the diagnostics logs will be stored.  
        2. If you select **Stream to an event hub**, configure the event hub that you want to stream the diagnostics logs to.
        3. If you select **Send to Log Analytics**, specify which instance of Log Analytics the diagnostics will be sent to.  

        ![Sample diagnostic settings](./media/diagnostic-logs/sample-diagnostic-settings.png)
1. Select **Save** on the toolbar to save the settings.

The new settings take effect in about 10 minutes. The logs are displayed in the configured archival target, in the **Diagnostics logs** pane. For more information about configuring diagnostics settings, see the [overview of Azure diagnostics logs](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-overview.md).


## Schema for hybrid connections events
Hybrid connections event log JSON strings include the elements listed in the following table:

| Name | Description |
| ------- | ------- |
| ResourceId | Azure Resource Manager resource ID |
| ActivityId | Internal ID, used to identify the specified operation. May also be known as "TrackingId" |
| Endpoint | The address of the Relay resource |
| OperationName | The type of the HybridConnection operation that’s  being logged |
| EventTimeString | The UTC timestamp of the log record |
| Message | The detailed message of the event |
| Category | Category of the event. Currently, it's only `HybridConnectionsEvents`. 


## Sample hybrid connections event
Here's a sample hybrid connections event in JSON format. 

```json
{
    "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/0000000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000000/RESOURCEGROUPS/MyResourceGroup/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.RELAY/NAMESPACES/MyRelayNamespace",
    "ActivityId": "7006a0db-27eb-445c-939b-ce86133014cc",
    "endpoint": "sb://myrelayns.servicebus.windows.net/mhybridconnection/7006a0db-27eb-445c-939b-ce86133014cc_G5",
    "operationName": "Microsoft.Relay/HybridConnections/NewSenderRegistering",
    "EventTimeString": "2020-04-27T20:27:57.3842810Z",
    "message": "A new on-premises sender is registering.",
    "category": "HybridConnectionsEvent"
}
```
