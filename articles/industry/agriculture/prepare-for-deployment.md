# Prepare for Deployment - Azure FarmBeats

  This article describes how to set up Azure FarmBeats. FarmBeats is an industry-specific, extensible solution for data-driven farming that enables seamless provisioning and sensor devices connectivity to Azure cloud, telemetry data collection and aggregation from various sensors such as cameras, drones, soil sensors, and management of devices from the cloud which includes infrastructure and services in Azure for the IoT-ready (Internet of Things) devices to an extendible web and mobile app to provide visualization, alerts and insights.

  Azure FarmBeats has the following two components:

  1. **Datahub** - Datahub is the platform layer of Azure FarmBeats that lets you build, store, process data and draw insights from existing or new data pipelines. This platform layer is useful to run and build your agriculture data pipelines and models.
  2. **Accelerator** - Accelerator is the solution layer of FarmBeats that has built-in application to illustrate the capabilities of FarmBeats using the pre-created agriculture models. This solution layer lets you create farm boundaries and draw insights from the agriculture data within the context of the farm boundary.

  Following is the duration of the time and expenses to deploy FarmBeats:

  1. Time required to deploy Azure FarmBeats- 30 minutes1. Time required to deploy Azure FarmBeats- 30 minutes
  2. Cost of a deployment: The overall cost incurred for FarmBeats product will vary based on the usage, but the steady state cost is approximately:

    -	Datahub: $500/month
    - Accelerator: $100/month

    Azure FarmBeats deployment creates the below listed resources within your subscription:

|S.No  |Resource Name  |FarmBeats Component  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|1  |       Azure Cosmos DB   |  Datahub       |
|2  |    Application Insights      |     Datahub/Accelerator     |
|3  |Azure Cache for Redis   |Datahub   |
|4  |       Azure KeyVault    |  Datahub/ Accelerator        |
|5  |    Time Series Insights       |     Datahub      |
|6 |      EventHub Namespace    |  Datahub       |
|7  |    Azure Data Factory V2       |     Datahub/ Accelerator      |
|8  |Batch account    |Datahub   |
|9  |       Storage account     |  Datahub/ Accelerator        |
|10  |    Logic app        |     Datahub      |
|11  |    API connection        |     Datahub      |
|12|      App service      |  Datahub/Accelerator       |
|13 |    App service plan        |     Datahub/ Accelerator      |
|14 |Azure Maps account     |Accelerator    |
|15 |       Time Series Insights      |  Datahub     |

  Azure FarmBeats is available for you to download from the Azure Marketplace. You can access it directly from Azure portal.  

## Prepare

  Access permission you require on Azure portal for deploying Azure FarmBeats:
  -	Tenant: Read Access
  - Subscription: contributor to owner
  -	Resource group: owner

  Before initiating the deployment, ensure you have the following ready:

  1. Sentinel account
  2. Azure Active Directory (app registration)
  3. Azure FarmBeats


## Create a sentinel account    

  An account with Sentinel  helps you to download the Sentinel Satellite imagery from their official website to your device. Follow these steps to create a free account:

  1. Go to https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/self-registration
    - In the registration page, provide a First Name, Last name, Username, Password, and Email

  2.  In the **Select Domain** drop-down menu, select the option **Land**.
  3.	In the **Select Usage** drop-down menu, select the option **Education**.
  4.	In the **Select Country** drop-down menu, select your **Country**.
  5.	Select **Register** to complete the registration process.

A verification email will be sent to the registered email address for confirmation. Click the link and confirm. Your registration process is complete.


## Create Azure Active Directory (AAD) app registration
  For authentication and authorization on Azure FarmBeats, you must have an Azure active directory app registration which:

  - Case 1: Installer can create automatically (provided you have the required tenant, subscription and resource group access permissions)
  - Case 2: You can create and configure before deploying Azure FarmBeats (requires manual steps).

  **For Case 1*: The installer assumes that you have the rights to create an Azure active directory application registration within the desired subscription. You can try this by creating a test AAD app registration (Login to portal >> Azure active directory >> app registration >> New registration). If yes, you can directly move to the next segment- marketplace offer creation.

  **For Case 2**: This is a preferred step when you do not have enough rights to create and configure an AAD app registration within your subscription. Request your IT admin to use the custom script is available [here](https://aka.ms/Create_AAD_App_Powershell_Script), which will help him/her automatically generate and configure the AAD app registration on the Azure portal. As an output to running this custom script using PowerShell environment the IT admin will need to share an Azure Active Directory Application Client ID and password secret with you. Make a note of these in a notepad file.

  Use the following steps to run the AAD application registration script:

  1.	Click [here](https://aka.ms/PPCreateAADappregistration)
  2.	Sign in to Azure portal and login to your desired subscription and AD tenant.
  3.	Launch CloudShell from the top navigation of the Azure portal.

      ![Project Farm Beats](./media/prepare-for-deployment/navigation-bar.png)

  4.	First-time users will be prompted to select a subscription to create a storage account and Microsoft Azure Files share. Select **Create storage**.
  5.	First-time will be prompted with a choice of preferred shell experience- Bash or Power Shell. Choose PowerShell.
  6.	In CloudShell enter the below commands to run the script.

      ![Project Farm Beats](./media/prepare-for-deployment/command-line.png)
  7.	Make note of the AAD application ID and client secret to share with the person deploying Azure FarmBeats.

## Create Azure FarmBeats offer on marketplace

  Use these steps to create Azure FarmBeats offer on the marketplace:

  1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** and select your account in the top-right corner, and switch to the desired Azure AD tenant where you want to deploy Microsoft FarmBeats.
  2. Click **Search/Marketplace** or click **Create Resources**/type **FarmBeats** to view the offer details. Download the guides available via aka.ms hyperlinks at this page before proceeding to the next steps.
  3.	Click **CREATE** and enter the following information:
    - Enter Subscription name.
    - Enter an existing Resource group name (empty resource group only) or create a new resource group for deploying Azure FarmBeats. Make note of this resource group to enter within the input.json file at a later stage.
    - Enter the Region you want to install FarmBeats into.

  |  | location |
  |--- | ---|
  | | Central US, West Europe, East US 2, North Europe, West US, Southeast Asia, East US, Australia East, West US 2. |

  	  ![Project Farm Beats](./media/prepare-for-deployment/create-farm-beats-on-market-place.png)

3. Click **OK** which will redirect you to the Terms of use page. Review the standard marketplace terms or click  FarmBeats specific Terms of use hyperlink.
5. Select **Close**, click the ‘I agree’ checkbox and then select **Create**.
6. You have now successfully signed Azure FarmBeats’s End-user License agreement (EULA) on the marketplace. To proceed with the deployment, continue to read this guide.

## Deploy within Cloudshell (browser-based command line)

  As part of the marketplace workflow you have created one Resource Group and signed the End-user License Agreement, which can be reviewed once again as part of the actual deployment. The deployment will be done via Azure Cloudshell (Browser-based command line) using Bash environment.  

  > [!NOTE]
  >CloudShell session expires in case of inactivity for more than 20 minutes. Make sure to complete the below deployment at a time.


  1.	Sign into **Azure** portal and login to the desired subscription and AD tenant
  2.	Launch **Cloud Shell** from the top navigation of the **Azure** portal.

  - Able to successfully login to the accelerator portal using the Accelerator link which you received as an output to a successful deployment.
  - Click **Create farm**
  - Under the icon “?” access the FarmBeats guides using the **Get started** button.


## Upgrade

  The steps for upgrade are similar to the first-time installation as the following:

  1.	Sign in on Azure portal and login to your desired subscription and AD tenant
  2.	Launch Cloud Shell from the top navigation of the Azure portal.

    ![Project Farm Beats](./media/deploy-within-cloudshell/navigation-bar.png)

  3.	Select a subscription to create a storage account and Microsoft Azure Files share.
  4.	Select **Create storage**.
  5.	Select the environment drop-down from the left-hand side of shell, which says Bash.

    ![Project Farm Beats](./media/deploy-within-cloudshell/bash-1.png)

  6.	Make changes to your input.json file only if needed and upload to the Azure CloudShell. For example- you can update your notification email address if required.
  7. Make note of the path to your input.json file (on your local computer).
  8.	Go to Azure CloudShell once again and once you are successfully authenticated, click the upload button (see highlighted icon in below snip) and upload the input.json file to CloudShell storage.

  	![Project Farm Beats](./media/prepare-for-deployment/bash-2.png)

  9.	Type or paste the “Deployment Command” into the Cloudshell. Make sure to modify the path to input. json file and press enter.

    > [!NOTE]
    > wget -N -O farmbeats-installer.sh https://aka.ms/FB_1.2.0 && bash farmbeats-installer.sh /home/dummyuser/input.json

  10.	The Installer will automatically prompt the required inputs on run-time:
     - Enter an access token for deployment. Copy the code generated and login to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin with your Azure credentials.
  (Important: This code will expire in the next 60 minutes. If so, you can restart by typing the “Deployment command” again.)
    - Sentinel password.
  11.	The installer will now validate and start creating the resources which can take about ~20 minutes.
  12.	Once the deployment goes through successfully you will receive the below output links:
    - Datahub URL: Swagger link to try FarmBeats APIs.
    - Accelerator URL: User Interface to explore FarmBeats Smart Farm Accelerator.
    - Deployer log file:  saves logs during deployment and can be used for troubleshooting.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Please make note of these and do keep the deployment log file path handy for later use.

## Uninstall

  Currently we do not support automated uninstallation of FarmBeats via installer. To remove single or both components of FarmBeats that is Datahub Accelerator, you are required to visit Azure portal and delete the pertinent Resource groups and/or resources manually. Follow the steps to uninstall

  If you have deployed Datahub and Accelerator in two independent resource groups, follow the steps for uninstallation:

  1.	Sign into the Azure Portal.
  2.	Select your account in the top-right corner, and switch to the desired Azure AD tenant where you want to deploy Microsoft FarmBeats.

  > [!NOTE]
  >As Datahub is the fundamental layer of FarmBeats which is required for Accelerator to operate properly, deleting Datahub alone will make Accelerator dis-functional and you will not be able to use the Accelerator alone any longer. Hence if you would like to continue using FarmBeats you are recommended to only uninstall Accelerator resource group.

  3.	On the left blade, click to the Resource groups option and now type in the name of your desired Datahub/Accelerator resource group, which you would like to remove.
  4.	Click the resource group name and this will open another blade containing the option of Delete resource group. Since deletion is a two-step process on Azure to prevent any mistakes, you will be required to type the name of the resource group again for certainty.
  5.	Click Delete to remove the resource group and all the underlying resources all at once.
  6.	Alternatively, you can delete each resource manually, which can be cumbersome, and we strongly advise against it.
  7.	Similarly, to delete/uninstall Datahub you can go to the Resource group directly on Azure and delete the resource group from there.
