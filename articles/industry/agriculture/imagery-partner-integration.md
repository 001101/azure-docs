# Imagery partner integration

This article describes the implementation of the Translator component to send imagery data into Azure FarmBeats. Agricultural Imagery data can be from various sources like multispectral cameras, satellites, drones. Agricultural Imagery Partners can integrate with FarmBeats and provide the end customer with their custom-generated maps in the context of a Farm.  

Data, once available, can be visualized through the FarmBeats Accelerator and potentially be used for data fusion and ML/AI model building by the Agribusiness or the customer’s System Integrator.

FarmBeats provides the ability to

1.	Define custom image types, source, file format using Extended Type APIs
2.	Ingest imagery data from various sources via the Scene & SceneFile APIs.

The below section focuses on getting any form of imagery into the FarmBeats system

Once you have purchased the drones/ camera payloads, you can access the partner software, which helps to plan drone flights and get raw data. You'll continue to use the partner’s software for path planning and orthomosaic image stitching.

Drone Partners need to enable customers to link their account with their FarmBeats instance on Azure.

You must use the following credentials in the drone partner software for linking FarmBeats:

1. API Endpoint
2. Tenant ID
3. Client ID
4. Client Secret
5. Translator Development
6. Rest API-based integration

Sensor data integration capabilities of FarmBeats are exposed via the REST API. Capabilities include metadata definition, device/sensor provisioning, device, and sensor management.

**Telemetry Ingestion**

The telemetry data is mapped to a canonical message that is published on Azure Event Hub for processing. Azure EventHub is a service that enables real-time data (telemetry) ingestion from connected devices and applications.

**API Development**

The APIs contain swagger technical documentation. Refer swagger for information on all the APIs and their corresponding requests/responses.
The Swagger is available at https://aka.ms/FarmBeatsDatahubSwagger .
Authentication
FarmBeats leverages Microsoft Azure’s Active Directory Authentication. Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support. For more information, see, [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization).   

FarmBeats Data hub uses Bearer Authentication, which needs the following credentials:

1. Client ID
2. Client Secret
3. Tenant ID

Using the above credentials, the caller can request for an access token, which needs to be sent in the subsequent API requests, in the header section as follows:

```
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token, …} 
```

Below is a sample Python code that gives the access token, which you can used for subsequent API calls to FarmBeats: 
 
import azure 

```
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials 
import adal 
#FarmBeats API Endpoint 
ENDPOINT = "https://<yourdatahub>.azurewebsites.net"   
CLIENT_ID = "<Your Client ID>"   
CLIENT_SECRET = "<Your Client Secret>"   
TENANT_ID = "<Your Tenant ID>" 
AUTHORITY_HOST = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com' 
AUTHORITY = AUTHORITY_HOST + '/' + TENANT_ID 
#Authenticating with the credentials 
context = adal.AuthenticationContext(AUTHORITY) 
token_response = context.acquire_token_with_client_credentials(ENDPOINT, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET) 
#Should get an access token here 
access_token = token_response.get('accessToken') 
```

**HTTP Request Headers**

Here are the most common request headers that need to be specified when making an API call to FarmBeats Data hub:

**Header** | **Description and Example**
--- | ---
Content-Type  | The request format (Content-Type: application/<format>) For FarmBeats Data hub API's format is json. Content-Type: application/json
Authorization | Specifies the access token required to make an API call. Authorization: Bearer <Access-Token>
Accept  | The response format. For FarmBeats Data hub APIs the format is json  Accept: application/json


**API Requests**

To make a REST API request, you combine the HTTP (GET, POST, or PUT) method, the URL to the API service, the URI to a resource to query, submit data to, update, or delete, and one or more HTTP request headers. The URL to the API service is the API Endpoint provided by the customer (https://<yourdatahub>.azurewebsites.net)  

Optionally, you can include query parameters on GET calls to filter, limit the size of, and sort the data in the responses.

The below sample request is to get the list of devices:

```
curl -X GET "https://microsoft-farmbeats.azurewebsites.net/Device" -H
"Content-Type: application/json" -H
"Authorization: Bearer <Access-Token>”

```

Most GET, POST, and PUT calls require a JSON request body.

The below sample request is to create a device (This has an input JSON with the request body).


```
curl -X POST "https://microsoft-farmbeats.azurewebsites.net/Device" -H  
"accept: application/json" -H  
"Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <Access-Token>" -d
"{  \"deviceModelId\": \"ID123\",  \"hardwareId\": \"MHDN123\",  \"reportingInterval\": 900,  
\"name\": \"Device123\",  \"description\": \"Test Device 123\",}"

```

Data Format

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common, language-independent data format that provides a simple text representation of arbitrary data structures. For more information, see, JSON.org

Steps to integrate the partner with FarmBeats:

Once the partner has the required credentials to make the connect to the FarmBeats Data hub, the partner must enable the following in their translator component.
1.	Create new extended type for the following fields to suit the imagery they are planning to upload:
  - Scene Source: For example, <drone_partner_name>
  - Scene Type: For example, <drone>
  - Scene File Type: For example, <chlorophyll index>
  - Scene File Content Type: For example, <image/tiff>
2.	Call the Farms API to get the list of Farms from within the Azure FarmBeats system
3.	Provide the customer with an ability to choose a single farm from the list of Farms.

    The partner system must show the farm within the partner software to do the path planning and drone flight and image collection.

4.	Call the Scene API and provide required details to create a new Scene with a unique SceneID
5.	Receive a Blob SAS URL to upload the required images into the FarmBeats data hub, in the context of the chosen farm into the FarmBeats system.

Here is a detailed flow on the API calls:

Step 1: ExtendedType

Check in the ExtendedType API, if the type and file source are available on FarmBeats. You can do this by calling a GET on the /ExtendedType API.

Following are the system defined values:
```
"key": "SceneFileContentType",       "value": [         "image/tiff",         "image/
png",         "image/jpeg",         "text/csv",         "text/plain",         "text/tab-separated-values",         
"application/json",         "application/octet-stream"       ]

"key": "SceneFileType",       "value": [         "evi",         "ndvi",         "ndwi",         
"tci",         "soil-moisture",         "sensor-placement",         "sentinel-b01",        
"sentinel-b02",         "sentinel-b03",         "sentinel-b04",         "sentinel-b05",         "sentinel-b06",         "sentinel-b07",         "sentinel-b08",
"sentinel-b8a",         "sentinel-b09",         "sentinel-b10",         
"sentinel-b11",         "sentinel-b12",         "cloud-mask",         "farm-mask"       ],

"key": "SceneType",       "value": [         "base-bands",         "sensor-placement",         
"soil-moisture",         "evi",         "ndwi",         "ndvi",         "drone"       ]

"key": "SceneSource",       "value": [         "sentinel-l1c",         "sentinel-l2a",         
"farmbeats-model",         "dji"       ]

```
This will be a one-time setup, and the scope of this new scenetype is limited to the subscription in which FarmBeats project is deployed.

Example: To add SceneSource: “SlantRange”, you do PUT on the ID of the /ExtendedType with key: “SceneSource” Input payload:

```
{   "key": "SceneSource",       "value": [         "sentinel-l1c",         "sentinel-l2a",         "farmbeats-model",         "dji",         "SlantRange"
      ]   "description": "List of scene sources available in system. User can add more values. Added dinamica-generale" }

```

Green field is the new addition to the system-defined scene source values.

Step 2: Get FarmDetails

The scenes (tiff or .csv files) will be in the context of a farm. You need to get the farm details by doing a get on /Farm API. The API will return you the list of farms available in FarmBeats, and you can select the farm you want to ingest the data for.

Get /Farm response:

```
{   "items  [     {       "id": "d41a33e7-b73e-480e-9279-0fcb3207332b",      
 "createdAt": "2019-10-04T11:33:35.01619Z",       "lastModifiedAt":
 "2019-10-04T11:33:35.01619Z",       
 "geometry": {         "type": "Polygon",         
 "coordinates": [           [             [               
 78.33494849794374,               
 17.427459159016905             ],             
 [               78.33470873178663,               17.429174852000685             ],             [               78.3370736978917,               
 17.43074495690408             ],             [               78.33494849794374,               
 17.427459159016905             ]           
 ]         ]       },       
 "name": "MicrosoftBuilding3",      
  "properties": {         "crops": "Others",         "address": "Microsoft Gachibowli"       }     }   ] }

 ```

Step 3: Create a /Scene ID (Post call)

Create a new scene (tiff or .csv file) with the given information, providing the Date, sequence & FarmID to which the scene will be associated. The meta-data associated with the scene can be defined here in the “properties” bag (including details of duration, type of measure, etc.)

This creates a new SceneID, which will be associated with the farm. Once the SceneID is created, the user can use the same to create a new file (tiff or .csv) & store the content of the file.

Example input payload for the Post call on/Scene API

```
{   "type": "nirsensordata",   "source": "dinamica-generale",   "farmId": "<farmid
from step 2>",   "date": "2019-10-04T16:13:39.064Z",   "sequence": 5,   
"name": "test scene",   "description": "test scene description",   "properties": {     "additionalProp1": {},     "additionalProp2": {},     "additionalProp3": {}   } }
```

Green fields: defined as part of the /ExtendedType API above

API Response:

```
{   "id": "a0505928-c480-491b-ba31-d38285a28c1d",   "createdAt":
"2019-10-04T16:19:12.4838584Z",   "lastModifiedAt":
"2019-10-04T16:19:12.4838584Z",   "type": "nirsensordata",   
"source": "dinamica-generale",   
"farmId": "d41a33e7-b73e-480e-9279-0fcb3207332b",  
 "date": "2019-10-04T16:13:39.064Z",   "sequence": 5,  
 "name": "test scene",   "description": "test scene description",   "properties": {} }

```

**Create/SceneFile**

The Sceneid returned from step 3 would be the input for the SceneFile, which will return a SAS URL token, which is valid for 24 hours. The user can use a blob storage Rest API to upload the local file through the SAS URL.

If the user requires a programmatic way of uploading a stream of images, the blob storage SDK can be used to define a method using the Scenefile ID, location & URL.

Example input payload for the Post call on /Scene API :

```
{   "sceneId": "a0505928-c480-491b-ba31-d38285a28c1d",   "type": "mobile-sensor-data",   "contentType": "image/tiff",   "name": "test scene file",   
"description": "test scene file description",   "properties": {     
    "additionalProp1": {},     "additionalProp2": {},     "additionalProp3": {}   } }
```
API Response:
```
{   "uploadSASUrl": "https://storagej2lho.blob.core.windows.net/farm-scene/2019/a0505928-c480-491bba31-d38285a28c1d/e91139a7-4ebd-4e2f-b17c-c677822dc840?sv=2018-0328&sr=b&sig=%2F1426JkDcIFE5g3d%2BjOevCVMIn%2FJo9YKwBn3La5zL8Y%3D&se=2019-1005T16%3A23%3A57Z&sp=w",   
"id": "e91139a7-4ebd-4e2f-b17c-c677822dc840",   
"createdAt": "2019-10-04T16:23:57.1192916Z",   "lastModifiedAt": "2019-10-04T16:23:57.1192916Z",   
"blobUrl": "https://storagej2lho.blob.core.windows.net/farm-scene/2019/a0505928-c480-491b-ba31d38285a28c1d/e91139a7-4ebd-4e2f-b17c-c677822dc840",   
"sceneId": "a0505928-c480-491b-ba31-d38285a28c1d",   
"type": "mobile-sensor-data",   "contentType":
 "image/tiff",   "name": "test scene file",   
 "description": "test scene file description",   "properties": {} }

```

The Post call to /SceneFile API returns a SAS upload URL, which can be used to upload the csv or tiff file using Azure Blob Storage client/library.
