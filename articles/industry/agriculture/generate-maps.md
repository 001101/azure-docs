# Generate maps

Using Azure FarmBeats, you can generate the following maps by using satellite imagery and sensor data inputs. Maps help you in viewing the geographical location of your farm and identify the appropriate location for your devices.

  -  **Sensor Placement Map** – gets recommendations on how many sensors to use and where to place them in a farm.
  - **Satellite indices Map** – gets vegetation index and water index for a farm.
  - **Soil Moisture Map** – gets soil moisture distribution by fusing satellite data and sensor data.

## Sensor placement maps

FarmBeats sensor placement map assists you with the placement of soil moisture sensors. The map output consists a list of coordinates for sensor deployment. The inputs from these sensors are used along with satellite imagery to generate the Soil Moisture Heatmap.  

This map is derived by segmenting the canopy as seen over multiple dates throughout the year, even bare soil and buildings are part of the canopy. You can remove sensors that are not required on the location. This map is for guidance and you can alter the position and numbers slightly based on your custom knowledge (adding sensors will not regress soil moisture heat map results but there is possibility of deterioration in heat map accuracy if sensor number is reduced).  

## Before you begin  

Ensure the following before you attempt to generate a sensor placement map:

1. Farm size must be more than one acre.
2. The number of cloud-free Sentinel scenes must be more than six for the selected date range.  
3. At least six cloud-free Sentinel scenes must have NDVI>=0.3.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sentinel allows only two concurrent threads per user. As a result, jobs will get queued and might take longer to complete.

### Dependencies on sentinel  

For information on Sentinel dependencies see the following:

1. We depend on Sentinel performance for downloading satellite images. Check Sentinel performance status and maintenance [activities](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/twiki/do/view/SciHubNews/WebHome).
2. Sentinel allows only two concurrent [downloads threads](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/sentinel-data-access/typologies-and-services) per user.

3. Precision map generation will be affected by [Sentinel coverage and re-visit frequency]( https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/revisit-coverage).

## Create sensor placement map

## Satellite Indices

The following sections explain you the procedures involved in creating and viewing satellite indices.

> [!NOTE]
> You can initiate Satellite Indices from the **Maps** page or from the  **Generate Precision Maps** drop-down menu on the **Farm Details** page.

FarmBeats provides you with the ability to generate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) maps for their farms. These indices help determine how the crop is currently growing or has grown over the past and the representative water levels were in the ground.


> [!NOTE]
> Sentinel Image must be present for the days on which the map is being generated.


## Create satellite indices map

Use the following steps:

1. On the home page, go to **Maps** from the left navigation menu.
2. Select **Create Maps** and select **Satellite Indices** from drop-down menu.

## Get soil moisture Heatmap

Soil moisture is the water that is held in the spaces between soil particles. The Soil Moisture heatmap helps you understand the soil moisture data at any depth, at high resolution within your farms. To generate an accurate and usable soil moisture heatmap, a uniform deployment of sensors is required, wherein all the sensors are from the same provider. Different providers will have differences in the way soil moisture is measured along with differences in calibration. The heatmap is generated for a particular depth using the sensors deployed at that depth.

### Before you begin  

Ensure the following before you attempt to generate a Soil Moisture Heatmap:

- At least three soil moisture sensors must be deployed. Microsoft recommends that you do not try to create a Soil Moisture Map before sensors are deployed and associated with the farm.  
- At least one cloud free Sentinel Scene must be available in the last 120 days from the day for which the Soil Moisture Map is requested.
- At least half of the sensors deployed on the farm must be online and have data streaming to the Data hub.
- Heatmap should be generated using sensor measures from the same provider.


## Create soil moisture Heatmap

Use the following steps:

1. On the home page, go to **Maps** from the left navigation menu to view the Maps page.
2. Select **Create Maps** and select **Soil Moisture** from drop-down menu.

3. Select **Soil Moisture**.
    The Soil Moisture window displays

4. Select a farm from the **Farm** drop-down menu.  
   To search and select your farm, you can either scroll from the drop-down list or type the name of the farm in the Select Farm drop-down menu.
5. In the **Select Soil Moisture Sensor Measure** drop-down menu, select the soil moisture sensor measure(depth) for which you want to generate the map.
To find the sensor measure, go to **Sensors**, select any soil moisture sensor, under ‘Sensor Properties’ section use the value listed against ‘Measure Name’
6. If you want to generate for **Today** or **This Week**, select one of the options.
7. If you want to generate for a custom date range, select **Select Date Range**, and provide the start and end date for which you want to generate the soil moisture map.
8. Select **Generate Maps**.
  A Confirmation message displays with the details about job created.
