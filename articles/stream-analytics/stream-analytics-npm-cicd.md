# Continuously integrate and develop with Azure Stream Analytics CI/CD NuGet package
This article describes how to use the Azure Stream Analytics CI/CD NPM package to set up a continuous integration and deployment process.

## Build the Visual Studio Code project

You can enable continuous integration and deployment for Azure Stream Analytics jobs using the [asa-streamanalytics-cicd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-streamanalytics-cicd) NPM package. The NPM package provides the tools to generate Azure Resource Manager templates of [Stream Analytics Visual Studio Code projects](quick-create-vs-code.md). It can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux without installing Visual Studio Code.

Once you have [downloaded the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-streamanalytics-cicd), use the following command to output the Azure Resource Manager templates. If the **outputPath** is not specified, the templates will be placed in the **Deploy** folder under the project's **bin** folder.

```powershell
asa-cicd build -scriptPath <scriptFullPath> -outputPath <outputPath>
```

When a Stream Analytics Visual Studio Code project builds successfully, it generates the following two Azure Resource Manager template files under the **bin/[Debug/Retail]/Deploy** folder: 

*  Resource Manager template file

       [ProjectName].JobTemplate.json 

*  Resource Manager parameters file

       [ProjectName].JobTemplate.parameters.json   

The default parameters in the parameters.json file are from the settings in your Visual Studio project. If you want to deploy to another environment, replace the parameters accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> For all the credentials, the default values are set to null. You are **required** to set the values before you deploy to the cloud.

```json
"Input_EntryStream_sharedAccessPolicyKey": {
      "value": null
    },
```

To use Managed Identity for Azure Data Lake Store Gen1 as output sink, you need to provide Access to the service principal using PowerShell before deploying to Azure.
