# Quickstart: Create an Azure Stream Analytics job using the Azure CLI

In this quickstart, you use the Azure CLI to define a Stream Analytics job that filters real-time sensor messages with a temperature reading greater than 27. Your Stream Analytics job will read data from IoT Hub, transform the data, and write the data back to a container in blob storage. The input data used in this quickstart is generated by a Raspberry Pi online simulator.

## Before you begin

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Prepare your environment

1. Sign in.

   Sign in using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command if you're using a local install of the CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

    Follow the steps displayed in your terminal to complete the authentication process.

2. Install the Azure CLI extension.

   When working with extension references for the Azure CLI, you must first install the extension.  Azure CLI extensions give you access to experimental and pre-release commands that have not yet shipped as part of the core CLI.  To learn more about extensions including updating and uninstalling, see [Use extensions with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).

   Install the [extension for Stream Analytics](/cli/azure/ext/stream-analytics/stream-analytics) by running the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name stream-analytics
    ```

   Install the [extension for Azure IoT](/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/azure-iot) by running the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name azure-iot
    ```

3. Create a resource group.

   All Azure resources must be deployed into a resource group. Resource groups allow you to organize and manage related Azure resources.

   For this quickstart, create a resource group named *streamanalyticsrg* in the *eastus* location with the following [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command:

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name streamanalyticsrg --location eastus
   ```

## Prepare the input data

Before defining the Stream Analytics job, prepare the data that is configured as input to the job.

The following Azure CLI code block does many commands to prepare the input data required by the job. Review the sections to understand the code.

1. Create an IoT Hub using the [az iot hub create](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-using-cli.md#create-an-iot-hub) command. This example creates an IoT Hub called **MyASAIoTHub**. Because IoT Hub names are unique, you need to come up with your own IoT Hub name. Set the SKU to F1 to use the free tier if it is available with your subscription. If not, choose the next lowest tier.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub create --name "<your IoT Hub name>" --resource-group streamanalyticsrg --sku S1
    ```

    Once the IoT hub has been created, get the IoT Hub connection string using the [az iot hub show-connection-string](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/iot/hub?view=azure-cli-latest) command. Copy the entire connection string and save it for when you add the IoT Hub as input to your Stream Analytics job.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub show-connection-string --hub-name "MyASAIoTHub"
    ```

2. Add a device to IoT Hub using the [az iothub device-identity create](../iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-c.md#register-a-device) command. This example creates a device called **MyASAIoTDevice**.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name "MyASAIoTHub" --device-id "MyASAIoTDevice"
    ```

3. Get the device connection string using the [az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string](/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot/hub/device-identity#ext-azure-iot-az-iot-hub-device-identity-show-connection-string) command. Copy the entire connection string and save it for when you create the Raspberry Pi simulator.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name "MyASAIoTHub" --device-id "MyASAIoTDevice" --output table
    ```

    **Output example:**

    ```output
    HostName=MyASAIoTHub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=MyASAIoTDevice;SharedAccessKey=a2mnUsg52+NIgYudxYYUNXI67r0JmNubmfVafojG8=
    ```

## Create blob storage

The following Azure CLI code block uses commands to create blob storage that is used for job output. Review the sections to understand the code.

1. Create a general-purpose storage account with the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account) command. The general-purpose storage account can be used for all four services: blobs, files, tables, and queues.

   Remember to replace placeholder values in angle brackets with your own values:

   ```azurecli
   az storage account create \
       --name <storage-account> \
       --resource-group <resource-group> \
       --location <location> \
       --sku Standard_ZRS \
       --encryption-services blob
   ```

2. Create a container for storing blobs with the [az storage container create](/cli/azure/storage/container) command. You use the storage account key to authorize the operation to create the container. For more information about authorizing data operations with Azure CLI, see [Authorize access to blob or queue data with Azure CLI](../common/authorize-data-operations-cli.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json).

   ```azurecli
   az storage container create \
       --account-name <storage-account> \
       --name sample-container \
       --account-key <key>
       --auth-mode key
   ```

## Create a Stream Analytics job

The following Azure CLI code block uses commands to create a Stream Analytics job. Review the sections to understand the code

1. Create a Stream Analytics job with the [az stream-analytics job create](/cli/azure/ext/stream-analytics/stream-analytics/job?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-stream-analytics-az-stream-analytics-job-create) command.

```azurecli
az stream-analytics job create \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup 
    --name MyJobName \
    --location "West US" \
    --output-error-policy "Drop" \
    --events-outoforder-policy "Drop" \
    --events-outoforder-max-delay 5 \
    --events-late-arrival-max-delay 16 \     
    --data-locale "en-US"
```

## Configure input to the job

Add an input to your job by using the [az stream-analytics input](/cli/azure/ext/stream-analytics/stream-analytics/input?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-stream-analytics-az-stream-analytics-input-create) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job input name, resource group name, and the job input definition as parameters. The job input definition is a JSON file that contains the properties required to configure the job’s input. In this example, you'll create a blob storage as an input.

On your local machine, create a file named `datasource.json` and add the following JSON data to it. Make sure to replace the value for `accesspolicykey` with the `SharedAccessKey` portion of the IoT Hub connection string you saved in a previous section.

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs",
    "properties": {
        "iotHubNamespace": "iothub",
        "sharedAccessPolicyName": "owner",
        "sharedAccessPolicyKey": "sharedAccessPolicyKey=",
        "consumerGroupName": "sdkconsumergroup",
        "endpoint": "messages/events"
    }
}
```

Next, run the `az stream-analytics input create` cmdlet, make sure to replace the value of `jobDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you've stored the job input definition JSON file.

```azurecli
az stream-analytics input create 
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup 
    --job-name MyJobName \
    --name MyInputName \
    --type Stream \
    --datasource @datasource.json \
    --serialization @serialization.json
```

## Configure output to the job

Add an output to your job by using the [az stream-analytics output create](/cli/azure/ext/stream-analytics/stream-analytics/output?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-stream-analytics-az-stream-analytics-output-create) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job output name, resource group name, and the job output definition as parameters. The job output definition is a JSON file that contains the properties required to configure job’s output. This example uses blob storage as output.

On your local machine, create a file named `datasource.json`, and add the following JSON data to it. Make sure to replace the value for `accountKey` with your storage account’s access key that is the value stored in $storageAccountKey value.

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage/Blob",
    "properties": {
        "storageAccounts": [
            {
                "accountName": "someAccountName",
                "accountKey": "accountKey=="
            }
        ],
        "container": "state",
        "pathPattern": "{date}/{time}",
        "dateFormat": "yyyy/MM/dd",
        "timeFormat": "HH"
    }
}
```

Next, run the `az stream-analytics output` cmdlet. Make sure to replace the value of `jobOutputDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you have stored the job output definition JSON file.

```azurecli
az stream-analytics output create 
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --job-name MyJobName \
    --name MyOutputName \
    --datasource @datasource.json \
    --serialization @serialization.json
```

## Define the transformation query

Add a transformation your job by using the [az stream-analytics transformation create](/cli/azure/ext/stream-analytics/stream-analytics/transformation?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-stream-analytics-az-stream-analytics-transformation-create) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job transformation name, resource group name, and the job transformation definition as parameters. 

Run the `az stream-analytics transformation create` cmdlet.

```azurecli
az stream-analytics transformation create 
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --job-name MyJobName \
    --name Transformation \
    --streaming-units "6" \
    --transformation-query "SELECT * INTO BlobOutput FROM IoTHubInput HAVING Temperature > 27"
```
## Run the IoT simulator

1. Open the [Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Online Simulator](https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/).

2. Replace the placeholder in Line 15 with the entire Azure IoT Hub Device connection string you saved in a previous section.

3. Click **Run**. The output should show the sensor data and messages that are being sent to your IoT Hub.

    ![Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Online Simulator](./media/stream-analytics-quick-create-powershell/ras-pi-connection-string.png)

## Start the Stream Analytics job and check the output

Start the job by using the [az stream-analytics job start](/cli/azure/ext/stream-analytics/stream-analytics/job?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-stream-analytics-az-stream-analytics-job-start) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, resource group name, output start mode, and start time as parameters. `OutputStartMode` accepts values of `JobStartTime`, `CustomTime`, or `LastOutputEventTime`.

After you run the following cmdlet, it returns `True` as output if the job starts. In the storage container, an output folder is created with the transformed data.

```azurecli
az stream-analytics job start 
--resource-group MyResourceGroup \
--name MyJobName \
--output-start-mode JobStartTime
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, the streaming job, and all related resources. Deleting the job avoids billing the streaming units consumed by the job. If you're planning to use the job in future, you can skip deleting it, and stop the job for now. If you aren't going to continue to use this job, delete all resources created by this quickstart by running the following cmdlet:

```powershell
az group delete \
    --name <resource-group> \
    --no-wait
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a simple Stream Analytics job using PowerShell. You can also deploy Stream Analytics jobs using the [Azure portal](stream-analytics-quick-create-portal.md) and [Visual Studio](stream-analytics-quick-create-vs.md).
