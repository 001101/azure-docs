# Azure Security Baseline for Stream Analytics

The Azure Security Baseline for Stream Analytics contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

### 9.1: Ensure Regular Automated Back Ups

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2973).

**Guidance**: Based on the type of output service selected. you can perform automated backups of the output data as per recommended guidelines for your output service.  The internal data including User-defined functions, queries, data snapshots is stored in the configured storage account which you can backup on a regular basis.

The data in your Microsoft Azure storage account is always automatically replicated to ensure durability and high availability. Azure Storage copies your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. You can choose to replicate your data within the same data center, across zonal data centers within the same region, or across geographically separated regions. 

You can also use lifecycle management feature to backup data to the Archive tier.  Additionally, enable soft delete for your backups stored in Storage account.

**Guidance**: The internal data including User-defined functions, queries, data snapshots is stored in the configured storage account which you can backup on a regular basis.

In order to backup data from Storage account supported services, there are multiple methods available including using azcopy or third party tools. Immutable storage for Azure Blob storage enables users to store business-critical data objects in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state. This state makes the data non-erasable and non-modifiable for a user-specified interval.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2978).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert. 
Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
