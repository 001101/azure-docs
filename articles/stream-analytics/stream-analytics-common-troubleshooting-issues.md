# Common issues in Stream Analytics and steps to troubleshoot

## Troubleshoot malformed input events

 Serialization issues are caused when the input stream of your Stream Analytics job contains malformed messages. For example, a malformed message could be caused by a missing parenthesis or missing brace in a JSON object, or incorrect time stamp format in a time field. 
 
 When a Stream Analytics job receives a malformed message from an input, it drops the message and notifies user with a warning. A warning symbol is shown on the **Inputs** tile of your Stream Analytics job (This warning sign exists as long as the job is in running state):

![Inputs tile](media/stream-analytics-malformed-events/inputs_tile.png)

To see more information, enable the diagnostics logs to view the details of the warning. For malformed input events, the execution logs contain an entry with the message that looks like: “Message: Could not deserialize the input event(s) from resource <blob URI> as json)". 

### Troubleshooting steps

1. Navigate to the input tile and click to view warnings.

2. The input details tile displays a set of warnings with details about the issue. Following is an example warning message, the warning message shows the Partition, Offset, and sequence numbers where there is malformed JSON data.

3. To get the JSON data that has incorrect format, run the CheckMalformedEvents.cs code. This example is available in the [GitHub samples repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-stream-analytics/tree/master/Samples/CheckMalformedEventsEH). This code reads the partition ID, offset, and prints the data that's located in that offset. 

4. Once you read the data, you can analyze and correct the serialization format. 

## Handle duplicate records in Azure SQL Database output

When you configure Azure SQL database as output to a Stream Analytics job, it bulk inserts records into the destination table. In general, Azure stream analytics guarantees [at least once delivery]( https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/event-delivery-guarantees-azure-stream-analytics) to the output sink, one can still [achieve exactly-once delivery]( https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/streamanalytics/2017/01/13/how-to-achieve-exactly-once-delivery-for-sql-output/) to SQL output when SQL table has a unique constraint defined. 

Once unique key constraints are set up on the SQL table, and there are duplicate records being inserted into SQL table, Azure Stream Analytics removes the duplicate record. It splits the data into batches and recursively inserting the batches until a single duplicate record is found. If there is a considerable number of duplicate rows in your pipeline, splitting and recursively inserting data ignoring duplicates one by one is a time-consuming process. If you see multiple key violation warning messages in your Activity log within the past hour, it’s likely that your SQL output is slowing down the entire job. 

To resolve this issue, you should [configure the index]( https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-index-transact-sql) that is causing the key violation by enabling the IGNORE_DUP_KEY option. Enabling this option allows duplicate values to be ignored by SQL during bulk inserts and SQL Azure simply produces a warning message instead of an error. Azure Stream Analytics does not produce primary key violation errors anymore.

Note the following observations when configuring IGNORE_DUP_KEY for several types of indexes:

* You cannot set IGNORE_DUP_KEY on a primary key or a unique constraint that uses ALTER INDEX, you need to drop and recreate the index.  
* You can set the IGNORE_DUP_KEY option using ALTER INDEX for a unique index, which is different from PRIMARY KEY/UNIQUE constraint and created using CREATE INDEX or INDEX definition.  
* IGNORE_DUP_KEY doesn’t apply to column store indexes because you can’t enforce uniqueness on such indexes.  

## Job is running but no output is produced
When a large time window (several days, up to seven days) is used for windowing functions, then a job is restarted, potentially no output is produced for some time.  To produce correct output over the large time windows, the job starts up by reading data from several days ago to fill the time window. During that time, no output is produced until the catch-up read of the outstanding input events is complete. 

This problem can happen when the system upgrades the streaming jobs, thus restarting the job. Such upgrades generally occur once every couple of months. 

One mitigation for this kind of slow startup time is to use query parallelization techniques (partitioning the data), or add more Streaming Units to improve the throughput until the job catches up.
