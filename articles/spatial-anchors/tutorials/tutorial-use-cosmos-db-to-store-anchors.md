# Tutorial: Use Cosmos DB to Store Azure Spatial Anchors

This tutorial shows how to enhance your experience by using Azure Cosmos DB to share anchor identifiers and additional data across other devices. [Spatial Anchors](../overview.md) is a cross-platform developer service that allows you to create Mixed Reality experiences using objects that persist their location across devices over time. When you're finished, you'll have an app that can be deployed to two or more devices. Azure Spatial Anchors created by one instance will share their identifiers to the others using Cosmos DB.

You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy an ASP.NET Core Web App in Azure that can be used to share anchors, storing them in Cosmos DB.
> * Configure the AzureSpatialAnchorsLocalSharedDemo scene within the Unity Sample from our Quickstarts to take advantage of the Sharing Anchors Web App.
> * Deploy and run to one or more devices.

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table](../../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table.md)]

Take note of the `Connection String` as it will be used later on.

## Deploy your Sharing Anchors Service

Open Visual Studio, and open the project at the `Sharing\SharingServiceSample` folder.

### Configure the service so that it uses your Cosmos DB

In the **Solution Explorer**, open `SharingService\Startup.cs`.

Locate the `#define INMEMORY_DEMO` line at the top of the file and comment it out. Save the file.

In the **Solution Explorer**, open `SharingService\appsettings.json`.

Locate the `StorageConnectionString` property, and set the value to be the `Connection String` that you took note of in the [create a database account step](#create-a-database-account). Save the file.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you've used Azure Cosmos DB to share anchor identifiers across devices. To learn more about the Azure Spatial Anchors library, continue to our concept guide on how to create and locate anchors.
