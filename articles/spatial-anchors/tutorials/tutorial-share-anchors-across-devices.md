# Tutorial: Share Azure Spatial Anchors across devices

[Spatial Anchors](../overview.md) is a cross-platform developer service that allows you to create Mixed Reality experiences
using objects that persist their location across devices over time. This tutorial covers how to share Spatial Anchors that you have created across other devices. When you're finished, you'll have an app that can be deployed to two or more devices. Spatial Anchors created by one instance can be shared to the others.

You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy an ASP.NET Core Web App in Azure that can be used to share anchors, storing them in memory for a duration of time.
> * Configure the AzureSpatialAnchorsLocalSharedDemo scene within the Unity Sample from our Quickstarts to take advantage of the Sharing Anchors Web App.
> * Deploy and run to one or more devices.

## Deploy your Sharing Anchors Service

Open Visual Studio, and open the project at the `Sharing\SharingServiceSample` folder.

[!INCLUDE [Publish Azure](../../../includes/spatial-anchors-publish-azure.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Run Share Anchors Sample](../../../includes/spatial-anchors-run-share-sample.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Clean-up section](../../../includes/clean-up-section-portal.md)]

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you've deployed an ASP.NET Core Web App in Azure, and then configured and deployed a Unity App. You created Spatial Anchors with the app, and shared them with other devices by using your ASP.NET Core Web App. To learn more about how to improve your ASP.NET Core Web App so that it uses Cosmos DB to store your shared Spatial Anchors, continue to the next tutorial.
