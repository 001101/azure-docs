# Tutorial: Share Azure Spatial Anchors across sessions and devices

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use [Azure Spatial Anchors](../overview.md) to create anchors during one session and then locate them, on the same device or on a different one. These same anchors could also be located by multiple devices in the same place and at the same time.

Azure Spatial Anchors is a cross-platform developer service that allows you to create mixed reality experiences using objects that persist their location across devices over time. When you're finished, you'll have an app that can be deployed to two or more devices. Azure Spatial Anchors created by one instance can be shared to the others.

You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy an ASP.NET Core Web App in Azure that can be used to share anchors, storing them in memory for a duration of time.
> * Configure the AzureSpatialAnchorsLocalSharedDemo scene within the Unity Sample from our Quickstarts to take advantage of the Sharing Anchors Web App.
> * Deploy and run to one or more devices.

[!INCLUDE [Share Anchors Sample Prerequisites](../../../includes/spatial-anchors-share-sample-prereqs.md)]

It's worth noticing that, although you'll be using Unity and an ASP.NET Core Web App in this Tutorial, it is only to show an example on how to share Azure Spatial Anchor identifiers across other devices. You can use other languages and back-end technologies to achieve the same goal. Also, the ASP.NET Core Web App used in this Tutorial has a dependency on .NET Core 2.2 SDK. It runs fine on regular Azure Web Apps (for Windows), but will currently not work on Azure Web Apps for Linux.

[!INCLUDE [Create Spatial Anchors resource](../../../includes/spatial-anchors-get-started-create-resource.md)]

## Download the sample project

[!INCLUDE [Clone Sample Repo](../../../includes/spatial-anchors-clone-sample-repository.md)]

## Deploy your Sharing Anchors Service

# [Visual Studio](#tab/VS)

Open Visual Studio, and open the project at the `Sharing\SharingServiceSample` folder.

[!INCLUDE [Publish Azure](../../../includes/spatial-anchors-publish-azure.md)]

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/VSC)

You will need to create a resource Group and an App Service Plan before you deploy the service in VS Code.

## Sign in to Azure

Naviagte to the href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">azure website</a> and sign in to your Azure subscription.

### Create a resource group

[!INCLUDE [resource group intro text](resource-group.md)]

Next to **Resource Group**, select **New**.

Name the resource group **myResourceGroup** and select **OK**.

### Create an App Service plan

[!INCLUDE [app-service-plan](app-service-plan.md)]

Next to **Hosting Plan**, select **New**.

In the **Configure Hosting Plan** dialog box, use these settings:

| Setting | Suggested value | Description |
|-|-|-|
|App Service Plan| MySharingServicePlan | Name of the App Service plan. |
| Location | West US | The datacenter where the web app is hosted. |
| Size | Free | The [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) that determines hosting features. |

Select **OK**.

Open Visual Studio Code, and open the project at the `Sharing\SharingServiceSample` folder. Follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vscode?view=aspnetcore-3.0" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to deploy the sharing service through Visual Studio Code.

## Adding Azure Cosmos DB to your Web App

In this tutorial, you've deployed an ASP.NET Core Web App in Azure, and then configured and deployed a Unity App. You created Spatial Anchors with the app, and shared them with other devices by using your ASP.NET Core Web App.

You can improve your ASP.NET Core Web App so that it uses Azure Cosmos DB to store your shared Spatial Anchor identifiers. Azure Cosmos DB will give persistence to your ASP.NET Core Web App. Doing so will allow your app to create an anchor today, and come back days later to be able to locate it again, by using the anchor identifier stored in your web app.

Add an Azure Cosmos Databse to the resource group you created in earlier. 

### Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table](../../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table.md)]

Copy the `Connection String` because you'll need it.

### Make minor changes to the SharingService files

In **Solution Explorer**, open `SharingService\Startup.cs`.

Locate `#define INMEMORY_DEMO` at the top of the file and comment that line out. Save the file.

In **Solution Explorer**, open `SharingService\appsettings.json`.

Locate the `StorageConnectionString` property, and set the value to be the same as the `Connection String` value that you copied in the [create a database account step](#create-a-database-account). Save the file.

You can publish the Sharing Service again and finally deploy the app.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you've used Azure Cosmos DB to share anchor identifiers across devices. To learn more about how to use Azure Spatial Anchors in a new Unity HoloLens app, continue to the next tutorial.
