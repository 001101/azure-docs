# Authentication and Authorization to Azure Spatial Anchors

In this section, we will cover the various ways you can authenticate to Azure Spatial Anchors from your app or web service, and the ways in which you can leverage Role-Based Access Control in Azure Directory (AAD) to control access to your Spatial Anchors accounts.  

1. [Overview](#overview) 
2. [Account keys](#account-keys)  
3. [User-based AAD authentication](#aad-user-authentication) 
4. [Service-based AAD authentication](#aad-service-authentication)
5. [Role Based Access Control](#role-based-access-control) 

## Overview

![An overview of authentication to Azure Spatial Anchors](./media/spatial-anchors-authentication-overview.png)

In order to be able to access a given Azure Spatial Anchors account, clients need to first obtain an access token from Azure Mixed Reality Security Token Service (STS). Tokens obtained from STS are short-lived (up to 24 hours), and contain information for the Spatial Anchors services to make authorization decisions on the account, and ensure that only authorized principals can access that account. 

Such tokens can be obtained in exchange from either AAD-issued tokens, or from account keys. Account keys enable you to get quickly started on using the Azure Spatial Anchors service; however, before you deploy your application to production, it is strongly advised that you update your app to use AAD-based authentication. 

There are two ways to obtain authentication tokens from AAD:

1.	If you are building an enterprise application, and your company is using AAD as its identity system, you may use user-based AAD authentication in your app, and grant access to your spatial anchors accounts using your existing AAD security groups, or directly to users in your organization. 
2.	Otherwise, it is recommended that you obtain AAD tokens from a web service supporting your app. This is the recommended method of authentication for production applications, as it avoids embedding the credentials for accessing Azure Spatial Anchors in your client application. 

## Account Keys

Using account keys for access to your Azure Spatial Anchors account is the simplest way to get started. You will find your account keys on the Azure portal. Navigate to your account, and select the “Keys” tab.

![An overview of authentication to Azure Spatial Anchors](./media/spatial-anchors-account-keys.png)

Two keys are made available, which are both simultaneously valid for access to the Spatial Anchors account. It is strongly recommended that you regularly update the key you use to access the account; having two separate valid keys enable such updates without downtime; you only have to update  alternatively the primary key and the secondary key. 

The SDK has built-in support for authenticating with account keys; you simply need to set the AccountKey property on your cloudSession object. 

```csharp
this.cloudSession.Configuration.AccountKey = @"MyAccountKey";
```

Once that is done, the SDK will handle the exchange of the account key for an access token, and the necessary caching of tokens for your app. 
Warning: use of account keys is recommended for quick on-boarding, but during development/prototyping only. It is strongly recommended not to ship your application to production using an embedded account key in it, and to instead use the user-based or service-based AAD authentication approaches listed next.

## AAD User Authentication

For applications targeting Azure Active Directory users, the recommended approach is to simply use an AAD token for the user, which you can obtain using the ADAL library as described in the following documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview ; you should follow the steps listed under “Quick starts”, which typically include

1. Configuration in Azure portal
    1.	Register your application in AAD as “Native application”. As part of that, you will need to determine whether your application should be multi-tenant or not, and provide the redirect URLs allowed for your application.  
    2.	Grant your application or users access to your resource: 
        1.	Navigate to your Spatial Anchors resource in Azure portal
        2.	Switch to the “Access control (IAM)” tab
        3.	Hit “Add role assignment”
            1.	Select a role (Add link to the RBAC roles section further in this doc)
            2.	In the “select” field, enter the name of the user(s), group(s), and/or application(s) to which you want to assign access. 
            3.	Hit “Save”.
2. In your code:
    1.	Make sure to use the application Id and redirect Uri of your own AAD application as the client ID and RedirectUri parameters in ADAL
    2.	Set the tenant information:
        1.	If your application supports My organization only, replace this value with your Tenant Id or Tenant name (for example, contoso.microsoft.com)
        2.	If your application supports Accounts in any organizational directory, replace this value with organizations
        3.	If your application supports All Microsoft account users, replace this value with common
    3.	On your token request, set the “resource” to "https://sts.mixedreality.azure.com" ; this is what will indicate to AAD that your application is requesting a token for the Azure Spatial Anchors service.  

With that, your application should be able to obtain from ADAL an AAD token; you can set that AAD token as the “authenticationToken” on your cloud session config object. 

```csharp
this.cloudSession.Configuration.AuthenticationToken = @"MyAuthenticationToken";
```

## AAD Service Authentication

The recommended option to deploy apps leveraging Azure Spatial Anchors to production is to leverage a backend service that will broker authentication requests. The general scheme should be as described in this diagram:

![An overview of authentication to Azure Spatial Anchors](./media/spatial-anchors-aad-authentication.png)

Here, it is assumed that your app uses its own mechanism (eg Microsoft account, PlayFab, Facebook, Google ID, custom username/password, etc…) to authenticate to its backend service. Once your users are authenticated to your backend service, that service can retrieve an AAD token, exchange it for an access token for Azure Spatial Anchors, and return it back to your client application.

The AAD access token is retrieved using the ADAL library as described in the following documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview ; you should follow the steps listed under “Quick starts”, which include:

1.	Configuration in Azure portal:
    1.	Register your application in AAD:
        1.	In Azure portal, navigate to “Azure Active Directory”, and select “app registrations”
        2.	Select “new application registration”
        3.	Enter the name of your application, select “Web app / API” as the application type, and enter the auth URL for your service. Then hit “Create”.
        4.	On that application, hit “Settings”, then select the “Keys” tab. Enter the name of your key, select a duration and hit “Save”. Make sure to save the key value that is displayed at that time, as you will need to     include it in your web service’s code.
    2.	Grant your application and/or users access to your resource:
        1.	Navigate to your Spatial Anchors resource in Azure portal
        2.	Switch to the “Access control (IAM)” tab
        3.	Hit “Add role assignment”
        1.	[Select a role](#role-based-access-control)
        2.	In the “select” field, enter the name of the application(s) you just created and to which you want to assign access. If you want your app’s users to have different roles against the Spatial Anchors account, you should register multiple applications in AAD, and assign to each a separate role. Then implement your authorization logic to use the right role for your users.  
    3.	Hit “Save”.
2.	In your code (note: you can use the service sample included on GitHub):
    1.	Make sure to use the application Id, application secret and redirect Uri of your own AAD application as the client ID, secret and RedirectUri parameters in ADAL
    2.	Set the tenant ID to your own AAD tenant ID in the authority parameter in ADAL
    3.	On your token request, set the “resource” to "https://sts.mixedreality.azure.com" 

With that, your backend service can retrieve an AAD token. It can then exchange it for an MR token that it can return back to the client.  This is done via a simple REST call. Here is a sample call:

GET https://mrc-auth-prod.trafficmanager.net/Accounts/35d830cb-f062-4062-9792-d6316039df56/token HTTP/1.1

Where the Authorization header is formatted as follows: `Bearer <accoundId>:<accountKey>`

And the response contains the MR token in plain text.
 
That MR token is then returned to the client. You client app can then set it as its access token in the cloud session config.

```csharp
this.cloudSession.Configuration.AccessToken = @"MyAccessToken";
```

## Role-Based Access Control

To help control the level of access granted to applications, services or AAD users of your service, the following roles have been created for you to assign as needed against your Azure Spatial Anchors accounts:

- Spatial Anchors Account Owner: applications or users that have this role are able to create spatial anchors, query for them, and delete them. When you authenticate to your account using account keys, the “Spatial Anchors Account Owner” role is assigned to the authenticated principal. 
- Spatial Anchors Account Contributor: applications or users that have this role are able to create spatial anchors, query for them, but cannot delete them. 
- Spatial Anchors Account Reader: applications or users that have this role are only able to query for spatial anchors, but cannot create new ones, delete existing ones, or update metadata on spatial anchors. This is typically used for applications where some users curate the environment, while others can only recall anchors previously placed in that environment.
