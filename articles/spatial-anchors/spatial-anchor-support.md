Filing a support ticket is the most direct way to receive a response. However, if you need to contact the Azure Spatial Anchors support team directly regarding an issue with production deployment (ie. throttling limits), please use the email: [azuremrs@microsoft.com](mailto:azuremrs@microsoft.com).
