# What's happening to the Azure Batch AI service?

Azure Batch AI is retiring in March because its capabilities are available in (Azure Machine Learning service)[What is Azure Machine Learning service?](../machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml.md).  The Azure Machine Learning service became generally available on December 4, 2018. 

Along with many other machine learning capabilities, the Azure Machine Learning service includes a cloud-based managed compute target for training, deploying, and scoring ML models. This compute target is called the [Azure Machine Learning Compute](../machine-learning/service/how-to-set-up-training-targets.md#amlcompute). 

Azure Machine Learning service is exposed to users through Python SDKs, the Azure portal, and the CLI. 

## What do I need to do to prepare for this change?

Convert your scripts to use Azure Machine Learning Compute before June 28, 2019, to avoid disruptions to your applications and enjoy quality and feature updates. Azure Machine Learning service is exposed to users through a Python SDK, the portal, and the CLI. 

## Batch AI support timeline

| Date | Support details |
| ---- |-----------------|
| December 4, 2018 | Beginning this date, the ability to create a new Azure Batch AI subscription ended. You can continue to use your existing subscriptions as before. |
| Between Dec 4, 2018 and March 4, 2019 | If Azure Machine Learning service does not meet your need, and a supported functionality exists in the BatchAI service, you can raise a support request against the BatchAI service and request that your subscription be whitelisted to use the service. |
| March 4, 2019 | After this date, existing subscriptions to Azure Batch AI will no longer run. We expect to have migrated all our customers to Azure Machine Learning by then. |
