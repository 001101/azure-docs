# What's happening to Azure Batch AI?

We recently released **Azure Machine Learning Compute** which provides you with a cloud-based compute target for developing machine learning models. Because this service will fully replace the existing Azure Batch AI capabilities, Batch AI will be retired on June 28, 2019.

## How does this affect me?

Beginning December 4, 2018, we will no longer make updates to Batch AI. After this date, you will no longer be able to create new subscriptions. Existing subscriptions will continue to run through March 4, 2019.

By the end of March 2019, we expect to have full feature parity between Batch AI and Azure Machine Learning.

On June 28, 2019, the Azure Batch AI service will be retired and no longer be available. <!-- Existing subscriptions will... ***[what happens?]*** -->

## What do I need to do to prepare for this change?

Convert your scripts to use Azure Machine Learning Compute before June 28, 2019, to avoid disruptions to your applications and enjoy quality and feature updates.

For guidance in updating your code, see **"migration" article** *(link)*.
