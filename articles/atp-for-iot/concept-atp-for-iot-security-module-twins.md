# ATP for IoT module twins

For IoT solutions built in Azure, device twins play a key role in both device management and process automation.  
ATP for IoT offers full integration with your existing IoT device management platform, enabling you to manage your device security status as well as make use of existing device control capabilities. Integration is achieved by making use of the IoT Hub twin mechanism.  

Learn more about [device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins) and [module](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-module-twins) twins concepts in Azure IoT Hub.  

ATP for IoT maintains a security module twin for each device in the service. The security module twin holds all the information relevant to device security for each specific device in your solution. Device security properties are maintained in a dedicated security module twin for safer communication and for enabling updates and maintenance that require fewer resources.  

See [Create ATP for IoT module twin](quickstart-create-security-twin.md) and [ATP for IoT configuration objects](tutorial-agent-configuration.md) to learn how to create, customize and configure the twin. See [Understanding module twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-module-twins) to learn more about the concept of module twins in IoT Hub.
