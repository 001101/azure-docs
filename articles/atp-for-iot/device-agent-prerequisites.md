# Azure IoT Security device agent prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure IoT Security is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This article provides an explanation of the different building blocks of the Azure IoT Security service, what you need to begin and basic concepts to help understand the service. 

## Minimum requirements

**IoT Hub**
Azure IoT
 
## Supported resources

Security analytics and best practices are provided for the following resources:

- IoT Edge devices â€“ coming soon
- IoT leaf devices
  - Azure IoT Security agent model: <br>Use for monitoring remote connections, active applications, login events and OS configuration best practices.
  - Bring your own agent model: <br>Use for monitoring device identity management, device to cloud, and cloud to device communication patterns.
- Azure IoT Hub
- Related non-IoT Azure resources, powered by Azure Security Center

## Feature access
Azure IoT Security insights and reporting features are available using Azure IoT Hub and Azure Security Center. To [onboard Azure IoT Security into your Azure IoT Hub](quickstart-onboard-iot-hub), an account with Owner level privileges is required. After onboarding Azure IoT Security into your IoT Hub, Azure IoT Security insights are displayed as the **Security** menu in Azure IoT Hub and as  **Device** alerts in Azure IoT Security. 

## Supported service regions 
Azure IoT Security is currently supported in the following Azure regions:
  - Central US
  - Northern Europe
  - Southeast Asia

Support for additional regions is planned for a future release.
