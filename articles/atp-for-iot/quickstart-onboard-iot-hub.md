# Quickstart: Onboard an IoT Hub

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ATP for IoT is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This article provides an explanation of how to onboard the ATP for IoT preview service into your IoT Hub.  

> [!NOTE]
> ATP for IoT currently only supports standard tier and higher IoT Hubs.
>ATP for IoT is a single hub solution. If you require multiple hubs, multiple solutions are required. 

## Prerequisites for onboarding
- Log Analytics workspace
  - Two types of information are stored by default in your Log Analytics workpace by by ATP for IoT; **security alerts** and **recommendations**. 
  - You can choose to add storage of an additional information type, **raw events**. Note that storing **raw events** in Log Analytics carries additional storage costs. 
- IoT Hub (standard tier or higher)

## Enable ATP for IoT on your IoT Hub 

To enable security on your IoT Hub, do the following: 

1. Open your **IoT Hub** in Azure portal. 
2. Select and open **Security** from the left menu. 
3. Choose **Enable IoT Security**. 
4. Provide your Log Analytics Workspace details.

   - Elect to enable **twin collection** by leaving the **twin collection** toggle **On**. 
5. Click **OK**. 
6. Click **Save**. 

Congratulations! You've completed onboarding ATP for IoT to your IoT Hub.
