# Quickstart: Create custom alerts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ATP for IoT is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

# Custom Alerts

## Overview

You know your devices best.
For customers who fully understand their expected device behavior, ATP for IoT allows translating this understanding into a device behavior policy and alert on any deviation from the expected normal behavior.

Using custom groups and alerts, you can take full advantage of the end-to-end security information and categorical device knowledge to ensure better security across your IoT solution. 

## Security Groups

Security groups enable customers to define logical groups of devices, and manage their security state in a centralized way.
These groups can represent devices with specific hardware, devices deployed in a certain location, or any other group suitable to the customer’s needs.

Security groups are defined by a security module twin tag property named **SecurityGroup**. Change the value of this property to change the device’s security group. 

By default, each IoT solution on IoT Hub has one security group named **default**.

## Customize an alert

1. Open your IoT Hub. 
2. Select **Security**, then select **Custom alerts**. 
3. Choose the security groups you wish to apply the customization to. 
4. Click **Add a custom alert**
5. Enter an alert name (note that alert names cannot be changed after creation). 
6. Select a custom alert behavior from the dropdown list. 
7. Edit the required properties, click **OK**.
8. Make sure to click **SAVE**. Without saving the new alert, the alert is deleted the next time you close IoT Hub.

 
## Alerts available to customize

The following table provides a summary of alerts available for customization.

| Severity | Name                                                                                                    | Data Source | Description                                                                                                                                     |
