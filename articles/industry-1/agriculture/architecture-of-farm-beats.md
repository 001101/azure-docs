# Integration Patterns

The following sections describe the integration pattern for FarmBeats.

### Why integrate with FarmBeats?

This section is focused on Partners who want to integrate their data systems (like sensors, drones, weather stations) into FarmBeats.
FarmBeats is an extensible offering, which enables agribusinesses to add their different historical & real time agriculture datasets into a single platform. FarmBeats helps an agribusiness to normalize, contextualize and aggregate the data in the context of a farm.

By becoming a data partner with FarmBeats, you can open your systems to wider adoption, and reach out to more customers with your data offerings. FarmBeats provides an extensible API layer called the Datahub, which helps you ingest data from your devices systematically and into a standardized schema.

Once the data is available within your customersâ€™ FarmBeats instance, your customers can builder richer analytics and tools on top of your data.
