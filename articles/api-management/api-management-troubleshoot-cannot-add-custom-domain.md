# Failed to update API Management service hostnames

This article describes the " Failed to update API Management service hostnames" error that you may experience when you add a custom domain for Azure API Management service. It provides troubleshooting steps to help resolve the issues. 

## Symptom

 When you try to add a custom domain for your API Management service by using a certificate from an Azure key vault, you receive the following error message:

- Failed to update API Management service hostnames. Request to resource 'https://vaultname.vault.azure.net/secrets/secretname/?api-version=7.0' failed with StatusCode: Forbidden for RequestId: . Exception message: Operation returned an invalid status code 'Forbidden'.

## Cause

The API Management service does not have permission to access the key vault that you're trying to use for the custom domain.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](Https://portal.azure.com), select your API Management instance, and then select **Managed identities**. Make sure that the **Register with Azure Active Directory** option is set to **Yes**.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Key vaults** service, select the key vault that you're trying to use for the custom domain.
1. Select **Access policies**, check if there is a service principal that matches the name of the API Management service instance. If yes, select the service principal, and then make sure that it has **Get** permission under **Secret permissions**.

1. If the API Management service is not in the list, select **Add access policy**, and then create the following access policy: 
    - **Configure from Template**: None
    - **Select principal**: Search the name of the API Management service, and then select it from the list.
    - **Key permissions**: None
    - **Secret permissions**: Get
    - **Certificate permissions**: None
1. Select **OK** to create the access policy. 
1. Select **Save** to save the changes.

After that, try to create the custom domain in API Management service using the Key Vault certificate, and see if the issue is resolved.
