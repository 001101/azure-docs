# Azure Security Baseline for API Management

The Azure Security Baseline for API Management contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/826).

**Guidance**: Azure API Management can be deployed inside an Azure Virtual Network (Vnet), so it can access back-end services within the network. The developer portal and API gateway, can be configured to be accessible either from the Internet (External) or only within the Vnet (Internal).

- External: the API Management gateway and developer portal are accessible from the public internet via an external load balancer. The gateway can access resources within the virtual network.

- Internal: the API Management gateway and developer portal are accessible only from within the virtual network via an internal load balancer. The gateway can access resources within the virtual network.

Inbound and outbound traffic into the subnet in which API Management is deployed can be controlled using Network Security Group.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/827).

**Guidance**: Inbound and Outbound traffic into the subnet in which API Management is deployed can be controlled using Network Security groups (NSGs).  Deploy an NSG to your API Management subnet and enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

Caution: When configuring an NSG on the API Management subnet, there are a set of ports that are required to be open.  If any of these ports are unavailable, API Management may not operate properly and may become inaccessible.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/828).

**Guidance**: Configure API Management within a Virtual Network (VNet) in internal mode, and configure an Azure Application Gateway. Azure Application Gateway, a PAAS Service, which provides a Layer-7 load balancer. The Application Gateway acts as a reverse-proxy service and provides other features such as Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF).  Azure WAF provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities.

Combining API Management provisioned in an internal Virtual Network with the Application Gateway frontend enables the following scenarios:

- Use the same API Management resource for consumption by both internal consumers and external consumers.

- Use a single API Management resource and have a subset of APIs defined in API Management available for external consumers.

- Provide a turn-key way to switch access to API Management from the public Internet on and off.

Note: This feature is available in the Premium and Developer tiers of API Management.

### 1.6: Deploy network based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/831).

**Guidance**: Configure API Management within a Virtual Network (VNet) in internal mode, and configure an Azure Application Gateway. The Application Gateway acts as a reverse-proxy service and provides other features such as Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF).  Azure WAF provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. The Application Gateway WAF can be configured to run in the following two modes:

- Detection mode: Monitors and logs all threat alerts. You turn on logging diagnostics for Application Gateway in the Diagnostics section. You must also make sure that the WAF log is selected and turned on. Web application firewall doesn't block incoming requests when it's operating in Detection mode.

- Prevention mode: Blocks intrusions and attacks that the rules detect. The attacker receives a "403 unauthorized access" exception, and the connection is closed. Prevention mode records such attacks in the WAF logs.

Combining API Management provisioned in an internal Virtual Network with the Application Gateway frontend enables the following scenarios:

- Use the same API Management resource for consumption by both internal consumers and external consumers.

- Use a single API Management resource and have a subset of APIs defined in API Management available for external consumers.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/833).

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network (Vnet) Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security groups (NSGs) used on your API Management subnets. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

Inbound and Outbound traffic into the Subnet in which API Management is deployed can be controlled using NSGs. If any of these ports are unavailable, API Management may not operate properly and may become inaccessible. Having one or more of these ports blocked is another common misconfiguration issue when using API Management with a VNet. Refer to the API Management documentation for IP address, ports, and Service Tags required for functionality.

Understanding and using Service Tags: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/834).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your Azure API Management deployments. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ApiManagement" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure API Management deployments and related resources. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions for Azure Virtual Networks, such as:

- DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource manager templates, role-based access control (RBAC), and policies in a single blueprint definition. You can easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/847).

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of API Management user accounts and reconcile access as needed. In API Management, developers are the users of the APIs that you expose using API Management. By default, newly created developer accounts are active, and associated with the Developers group. Developer accounts that are in an active state can be used to access all of the APIs for which they have subscriptions.

Maintain an inventory of accounts that have administrative access to the Azure API Management control plane (Azure portal). Azure Active Directory (AD) has built-in roles that must be explicitly assigned and are queryable. Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups.

Follow recommendations from Azure Security Center for the management and maintenance of administrative accounts.
