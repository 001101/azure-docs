# Access and customize the new developer portal in Azure API Management

This article shows you how to access the new Azure API Management developer portal. It walks you through the visual editor experience - adding and editing content - as well as customizing the look of the website.

> [!NOTE]
> The new developer portal is currently in preview.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
- Import and publish an Azure API Management instance. For more information, see [Import and publish](import-and-publish.md).

## Managed and self-hosted versions

You can build your developer portal in two ways:

- **Managed version** - by editing and customizing the portal built-into an API Management instance. This is the experience described in this documentation article. 
- **Self-hosted version** - by deploying your own portal outside of an API Management instance. This approach allows you to edit the portal's codebase and extend the provided core functionality. For details and instructions, refer to the [GitHub repository with the source code of the portal][1].
