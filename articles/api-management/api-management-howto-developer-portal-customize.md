# Access and customize managed developer portal

Developer portal is an automatically generated, fully customizable website with the documentation of your APIs. It is where API consumers can discover your APIs, learn how to use them, request access, and try them out.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

If you're looking for more information on the developer portal, refer to the [Azure API Management developer portal overview](api-management-howto-developer-portal.md).

## Prerequisites

- Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md)
- Import and publish an Azure API Management instance. For more information, see [Import and publish](import-and-publish.md)

[!INCLUDE [premium-dev-standard-basic.md](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic.md)]

## Step 1: access the portal as an administrator

Follow the steps below to access the managed version of the portal.

1. Go to your API Management service instance in the Azure portal.
1. Click on the **Developer portal** button in the top navigation bar. A new browser tab with an administrative version of the portal will open.

## Step 2: understand the portal's administrative interface

### Default content 

If you're accessing the portal for the first time, the default content will be automatically provisioned in the background. Default content has been designed to showcase portal's capabilities and minimize the amount of customizations you need to perform to personalize your portal. You can learn more about what is included in the portal content by reading the [Azure API Management developer portal overview](api-management-howto-developer-portal.md).

### Visual editor

You can customize the content of the portal with the visual editor. The menu sections on the left let you modify or create pages, media, layouts, menus, styles, or website settings. The menu items on the bottom let you switch between viewports (for example, mobile or desktop), view the elements of the portal visible to authenticated or anonymous users, or save or undo actions.

### Layouts and pages

TODO: image

Layouts define how pages are displayed. For example, in the default content, there are two layouts with top navigation bars and footers - one applies to the landing page, and the other to all other pages.

A layout gets applied to a page by matching its URL template to the page's URL. For example, layout with a URL template of `/wiki/*` will be applied to every page with the `/wiki/` segment: `/wiki/getting-started`, `/wiki/styles`, etc.

### Styling guide

TODO: image

Styling guide is a panel created with designers in mind. It allows for styling all the visual elements and creating their variants. 

### Save button

![Save button](media/api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize/save-button.png)

Whenever you make a change in the portal, you need to save it manually by pressing the **Save** button (floppy disk) in the menu on the bottom. When you click the button, the modified content is automatically uploaded to your API Management service.

### Demonstration

In the video below we demonstrate how to edit the content of the portal, customize the website's look, and publish the changes.

## Step 3: customize the default content

Before you make your portal available to the visitors, you should personalize the automatically generated content. The areas, which require the most changes are the landing page and the styling.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to integration considerations, the following pages can't be removed or moved under a different URL: `/404`, `/500`, `/captcha`, `/change-password`, `/config.json`, `/confirm/invitation`, `/confirm-v2/identities/basic/signup`, `/confirm-v2/password`, `/internal-status-0123456789abcdef`, `/publish`, `/signin`, `/signin-sso`, `/signup`.

## Step 4: publish the portal

![Publish portal](media/api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize/publish-portal.png)

To make your portal and its latest changes available to visitors, you need to publish it. This operation takes a few moments.

## Step 5: visit the portal

Once your portal is published, it is available under the same URL as the administrative panel, for example `https://contoso-api.portal.azure-api.net`. You can visit it in a new browser tab.
