# Azure VMware Solution by Virtustream Documentation

Welcome to the internal repository for the Azure VMware Solution by Virtustream (AVSV) documentation that will be publicly available through the [Microsoft documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com). The objective is to integrate with the Microsoft documentation process and use this repository as the "first commit" of our documentation into their public repositories. (Further work on the documentation will be through that public repository.)

As a point of reference, we've been asked to use the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) as a model for our documentation. Check it out to get an idea of what our documentation will look like (beyond the markdown) when it makes its way through the Microsoft internal processes and engines on the path to being published.

And as a note, the term "Azure backbone network" comes from a number of Azure doc sites, including: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs
