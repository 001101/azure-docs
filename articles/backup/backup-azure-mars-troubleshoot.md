# Troubleshoot Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent

This article describes how to resolve errors you might see during configuration, registration, backup, and restore.

## Basic troubleshooting

We recommend that you check the following before you start troubleshooting Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent:

- [Ensure MARS agent is up to date](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=229525&clcid=0x409).
- [Ensure you have network connectivity between MARS agent and Azure](https://aka.ms/AB-A4dp50).
- Ensure MARS is running (in Service console). If you need to, restart and retry the operation.
- [Ensure 5% to 10% free volume space is available in the scratch folder location](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dwtt).
- [Check if another process or antivirus software is interfering with Azure Backup](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dwtk).
- If scheduled backup fails but manual backup works, see [Backups don't run according to schedule](https://aka.ms/ScheduledBackupFailManualWorks).
- Ensure your OS has the latest updates.
- [Ensure unsupported drives and files with unsupported attributes are excluded from backup](backup-support-matrix-mars-agent.md#supported-drives-or-volumes-for-backup).
- Ensure the clock on the protected system is configured to the correct time zone.
- [Ensure .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher is installed on the server](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30653).
- If you're trying to reregister your server to a vault:
  - Ensure the agent is uninstalled on the server and that it's deleted from the portal.
  - Use the same passphrase that was initially used to register the server.
- For offline backups, ensure Azure PowerShell 3.7.0 is installed on both the source and the copy computer before you start the backup.
- If Backup agent is running on an Azure virtual machine, see [this article](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dwtr).

## Invalid vault credentials provided

**Error message**: Invalid vault credentials provided. The file is either corrupted or does not have the latest credentials associated with recovery service. (ID: 34513)

| Cause | Recommended actions |
| ---     | ---    |
| **Vault credentials aren't valid** <br/> <br/> Vault credential files might be corrupt or might have expired. (For example, they might have been downloaded more than 48 hours before the time of registration.)| Download new credentials from Recovery Services vault on the Azure portal. (See step 6 in the [Download the MARS agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-configure-vault#download-the-mars-agent) section.) Then take these steps, as appropriate: <ul><li> If you've already installed and registered MARS, open the Microsoft Azure Backup Agent MMC console and then select **Register Server** in the **Actions** pane to complete the registration with the new credentials. <br/> <li> If the new installation fails, try reinstalling with the new credentials.</ul> **Note**: If multiple vault credential files have been downloaded, only the latest file is valid for the next 48 hours. We recommend that you download a new vault credential file.
| **Proxy server/firewall is blocking registration** <br/>or <br/>**No internet connectivity** <br/><br/> If your machine or proxy server has limited internet connectivity and you don't ensure access for the necessary URLs, the registration will fail.| Take these steps:<br/> <ul><li> Work with your IT team to ensure the system has internet connectivity.<li> If you don't have a proxy server, ensure the proxy option is not selected when you register the agent. [Check your proxy settings](#verifying-proxy-settings-for-windows).<li> If you do have a firewall/proxy server, work with your networking team to ensure these URLs and IP addresses have access:<br/> <br> **URLs**<br> www.msftncsi.com <br> .Microsoft.com <br> .WindowsAzure.com <br> .microsoftonline.com <br> .windows.net <br>**IP addresses**<br>  20.190.128.0/18 <br>  40.126.0.0/18 <br/></ul></ul>Try registering again after you complete these troubleshooting steps
| **Antivirus software is blocking registration** | If you have antivirus software installed on the server, add necessary exclusion rules to the antivirus scan for these files and folders: <br/><ui> <li> CBengine.exe <li> CSC.exe<li> The scratch folder. Its default location is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\Scratch <li> The bin folder at C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\Bin.

### Additional recommendations
- Go to C:/Windows/Temp and check whether there are more than 60,000 or 65,000 files with the .tmp extension. If there are, delete these files.
- Ensure the machineâ€™s date and time match the local time zone.
- Ensure [these sites](backup-configure-vault.md#verify-internet-access) are added to your trusted sites in Internet Explorer.

### Verifying proxy settings for Windows

1. Download PsExec from the [Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) page.
1. Run `psexec -i -s "c:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"` from an elevated command prompt.

   This will open Internet Explorer.
1. Go to **Tools** > **Internet options** > **Connections** > **LAN settings**.
1. Check the proxy settings for the system account.
1. If no proxy is configured and proxy details are provided, remove the details.
1. If a proxy is configured and the proxy details are incorrect, ensure the **Proxy IP** and **Port** details are accurate.
1. Close Internet Explorer.

## Unable to download vault credential file

## Backups don't run according to the schedule
If scheduled backups don't get triggered automatically, while manual backups work without issues, try the following actions:

- Ensure Windows Server backup schedule does not conflict with Azure files and folders backup schedule.

- Ensure the  Online Backup status is set to **Enable**. To verify the status perform the below:

  - Open **Task Scheduler** and expand **Microsoft**, and select **Online Backup**.
  - Double-click **Microsoft-OnlineBackup**, and go to the **Triggers** tab.
  - Verify if the status is set to **Enabled**. If it isn't, then select **Edit** > **Enabled** check box and click **OK**.

- Ensure the user account selected for running the task is either **SYSTEM** or **Local Administrators' group** on the server. To verify the user account, go to the **General** tab and check the **Security** options.

- Ensure PowerShell 3.0 or later is installed on the server. To check the PowerShell version, run the following command and verify that the *Major* version number is equal to or greater than 3.

  `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`

- Ensure the following path is part of the *PSMODULEPATH* environment variable

  `<MARS agent installation path>\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\bin\Modules\MSOnlineBackup`

- If the PowerShell execution policy for *LocalMachine* is set to restricted, the PowerShell cmdlet that triggers the backup task might fail. Run the following commands in elevated mode, to check and set the execution policy to either *Unrestricted* or *RemoteSigned*

  `PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`

  `PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`

- Ensure there are no missing or corrupted **PowerShell** module **MSonlineBackup**. In case there is any missing or corrupt file, to resolve this issue perform the below:

  - From any machine having MARS agent that is working properly, copy theÂ MSOnlineBackupÂ folder from *(C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\bin\Modules)* path.
  - Paste this in problematic machine in the same path *(C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\bin\Modules)*.
  - IfÂ **MSOnlineBackup**Â folder is already existed in the machine, paste or replace the content files inside it.


> [!TIP]
> To ensure that changes are applied consistently, reboot the server after performing the steps above.


## Troubleshoot restore issues

Azure Backup might not successfully mount the recovery volume, even after several minutes. You might also receive error messages during the process. To begin recovering normally, follow these steps:

1.  Cancel the ongoing mount process, in case it has been running for several minutes.

2.  See if you're on the latest version of the Backup Agent. To find out the version, on the **Actions** pane of the MARS console, select **About Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent**. Confirm that the **Version** number is equal to or higher than the version mentioned in [this article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=229525). You can download the latest version from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/?LinkID=288905).

3.  Go to **Device Manager** > **Storage Controllers**, and locate **Microsoft iSCSI Initiator**. If you can locate it, go directly to step 7.

4.  If you can't locate Microsoft iSCSI Initiator service, try to find an entry under **Device Manager** > **Storage Controllers** called **Unknown Device**, with Hardware ID **ROOT\ISCSIPRT**.

5.  Right-click on **Unknown Device**, and select **Update Driver Software**.

6.	Update the driver by selecting the option to  **Search automatically for updated driver software**. Completion of the update should change **Unknown Device** to **Microsoft iSCSI Initiator**, as shown below.

7.  Go to **Task Manager** > **Services (Local)** > **Microsoft iSCSI Initiator Service**.

    ![Screenshot of Azure Backup Task Manager, with Services (Local) highlighted](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/MicrosoftInitiatorServiceRunning.png)

8.  Restart the Microsoft iSCSI Initiator service. To do this, right-click on the service, select **Stop**, right-click again, and select **Start**.

9.  Retry recovery by using [**Instant Restore**](backup-instant-restore-capability.md).

If the recovery still fails, reboot your server or client. If you don't want to reboot, or the recovery still fails even after rebooting the server, try recovering from an alternate machine. Follow the steps in [this article](backup-azure-restore-windows-server.md#use-instant-restore-to-restore-data-to-an-alternate-machine).
