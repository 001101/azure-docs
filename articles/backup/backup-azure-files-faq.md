## Configuring the backup job for Azure Files

### Why can’t I see some of my Storage Accounts I want to protect, that contain valid File shares? <br/>
Azure Files Backup is currently in Preview, and only supported Storage Accounts can be configured for Backup. Be sure the Storage Account you are looking for, is a supported storage account.

### Why can’t I see some of my File shares in the Storage Account when I’m trying to configure backup? <br/>
Check if the File share is already protected in the same Recovery Services vault. Ensure that the File share you are looking to protect has not been deleted recently.

### Why can’t I protect File Shares connected to a Sync Group in Azure Files Sync? <br/>
Protection of Azure File Shares connected to Sync Groups is in limited preview. Please write to [AskAzureBackupTeam@microsoft.com](email:askazurebackupteam@microsoft.com) with your Subscription ID to requested access.

## Backup

### How many On-Demand backups can I take per file share? <br/>
At any point in time, you can have up to 200 Snapshots for a file share, including the ones taken by Azure Backup as defined by your policy. If your backups start failing because of reaching this limit, please delete On-Demand restore points accordingly.

### After enabling Virtual Networks on my Storage Account, the Backup of file shares in the account started failing. Why?
Currently, Azure Files backup is not supported for Storage Accounts that have Virtual Networks enabled. Disable Virtual Networks in Storage Accounts you want to back up. 

## Restore

### Can I recover from a deleted file share? <br/>
When you try to delete a file share, you will be shown the list of backups which will also be deleted if you proceed and a confirmation will be sought. You cannot restore from a deleted file share.

### Can I restore from backups if I stopped protection on a file share? <br/>
Yes you can restore from all existing restore points if you chose Retain Backup Data when you stopped protection.

### What happens when I change the Backup policy for a file share? >br/>
When a new policy is applied on file share(s), schedule and retention of the new policy is followed. If retention is extended, existing recovery points are marked to keep them as per new policy. If retention is reduced, they are marked for pruning in the next cleanup job and subsequently deleted.
