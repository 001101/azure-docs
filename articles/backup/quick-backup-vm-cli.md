# Back up a virtual machine with Azure CLI

Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command line and/or in scripts to be used for automation. This guide details steps to backup an Azure virtual machine using Azure CLI.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

This quickstart requires Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).


## Getting help with Azure CLI

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the command-line interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt).

When in doubt about the parameters needed by a command, use --help or -h as a parameter.

```azurecli-interactive 
    az account set --help

    az account set -h
```
## Connecting to your subscriptions

To log in using an organizational account, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive 
    az login -u <username> -p <password>
```
or if you want to log in by typing interactively
```azurecli-interactive 
    az login
```
If you have multiple subscriptions and want to use a specific one, type the following to see the subscriptions for your account:

```azurecli-interactive 
    az account list
``` 

Then, to specify the subscription to use, type:
```azurecli-interactive 
    az account set -s "<subscription name>"
```     
## Register the Azure Backup resource provider
Make sure that Azure Backup resource provider is registered in your subscription:

```azurecli-interactive
az provider register –namespace Microsoft.RecoveryServices
```

This only needs to be done once per subscription.

## Create a new resource group
A resource group is a logical container, in a region of Azure, into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.
Let's create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup" in the *eastus* region of Azure.  To do so type the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l eastus 
```

## Create a Recovery Services vault

The following example creates a Recovery Services vault named *myRSVault* in 'MyResourceGroup' in the *eastus* region of Azure

```azurecli-interactive 
az backup vault create --name myRSVault --location eastus --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

You can also use the short parameters for name, location and resource group as shown in the below example

```azurecli-interactive 
az backup vault create -n myRSVault -l eastus -g myResourceGroup
```

When the RS Vault has been created, the command output shows information similar to the following example.

```azurecli-interactive 
{
  "eTag": null,
  "id": "/subscriptions/a2bcfd5d-5486-4613-b94d-b3588c579009/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/myRSVault",
  "location": "eastus",
  "name": "myRSVault",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "upgradeDetails": null
  },
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
  "sku": {
    "name": "Standard"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults"

}
```

> [!TIP]
> The preceding output is in **json** format. You can specify which output format to use by specifying the `--output` argument in your CLI commands, or set it globally using `az configure`.

### Specify storage redundancy

Specify the type of storage redundancy: [Locally Redundant Stobgrage (LRS)](../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md#locally-redundant-storage) or [Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)](../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md#geo-redundant-storage). 
The following example sets the storage redundancy option for myRSVault to GeoRedundant.

```azurecli-interactive 
az backup vault backup-properties set -n myRSVault -g myResourceGroup --backup-storage-redundancy GeoRedundant
```

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change the storage redundancy after an item is backed up to the vault.

## Get the default policy 

A policy defines when a backup is performed and for how long each backup is retained. By default, a policy is provided per vault named as "DefaultPolicy"

## Enable protection for the virtual machine

Assume we have an Azure virtual machine ready to be backed up, with the name myVM under the resource Group VMResourceGroup. Make sure your VM is meeting the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-prepare) for Azure Backup

Then enable protection for this VM with the default policy to myRSVault.

```azurecli-interactive 
az backup protection enable—for-vm -n myRSVault -g myResourceGroup -p DefaultPolicy --vm-name myVM --vm-rg VMResourceGroup
```
## On-demand backup
Once you enable protection, the VM will backed up to the vault as per the policy. If you want to take a backup outside of policy, you need to specify until when this backup needs to be retained

```azurecli-interactive 
az backup protection backup-now -n myRSVault -g myResourceGroup -c myVM -i myVM --retain-until <dd-mm-yyyy>
```
## Status of backup

You can monitor the status of the backup by querying about jobs using the following command

```azurecli-interactive 
az backup job list -n myRSVault -g myResourceGroup -o table
```
## Clean up resources

Deleting a vault requires removing resources within the vault. First, you need to disable the protection of the VM and delete the corresponding backup data

```azurecli-interactive 
az backup protection disable -n myRSVault -g myResourceGroup -c myVM -i myVM --delete-backup-data true
```
On confirmation, all the backups of myVM will be deleted from this vault. Now, you can proceed to delete the vault and the resource group

```azurecli-interactive 
az backup vault delete -n myRSVault -g myResourceGroup
```

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete -n myResourceGroup
```

In this quick start, you’ve learned how to create a recovery services vault and protect a virtual machine to this vault.
