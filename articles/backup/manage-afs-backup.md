# Manage Azure file share backups

This article describes common tasks for managing and monitoring the Azure file shares that are backed up by the [Azure Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-overview) service. You will learn how to execute the following management tasks in the Recovery Services Vault:

* [Monitor jobs](#monitor-jobs)
* [Create a new policy](#create-a-new-policy)
* [Modify Policy](#modify-policy)
* [Stop protection on a file share](#stop-protection-on-a-file-share)
* [Resume protection on a file share](#resume-protection-on-a-file-share)
* [Delete backup data](#delete-backup-data)

## Monitor jobs

When you trigger a backup or restore operation, the backup service creates a job for tracking. You can monitor the progress of all jobs on the **Backup Jobs** page.

To open the **Backup Jobs** page:

1. Open the Recovery Services vault you used to configure backup for your file shares, and in the **Overview** blade, click **Backup Jobs** under the **Monitoring** section.
