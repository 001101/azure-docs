#Upgrade to VM backup stack V2
VM backup stack V2 provides following feature enhancements 
* Ability to see snapshot taken as part of backup job to be available for recovery without waiting for data transfer to complete.
Please note that this will reduce the wait on snapshot to be copied to vault before triggering restore. Also, this will eliminate the additional storage requirement we have for backing up premium VMs except for first backup.  

* Reduction in backup and restore times by retaining snapshots locally for 7 days. 

* Support for disk sizes up to 4TB.  

* Ability to use original storage accounts (even when VM has disks are distributed across storage accounts) when doing a restore of an unmanaged VM. This will make restores faster for a wide variety of VM configurations. 
    > [!NOTE] 
    > Please note this is not same as overriding the original VM.

## What is changing in the new stack?
Today backup job consists of two phases:
1.	Taking VM snapshot. 
2.	Transferring VM snapshot to Azure Backup vault. 

A recovery point is considered created only after 1 and 2 are done. As part of new stack, we will create recovery point as soon as snapshot is completed. You can also restore from this recovery point using the same restore flow. You can identify this recovery point in portal using “snapshot” as recovery point type. Once the snapshot is transferred to vault, recovery point type changes to “Snapshot and Vault”.

By default, we will retain snapshots for 7 days. This allow to complete restore faster from these snapshots by reducing the time required to copy data back from vault to customer storage account. 

## How to upgrade?
### Portal
If you are using portal, you will see a notification on vault dashboard related to large disk support and backup and restore speed improvements.
![Backup job in VM backup stack V2](./media/backup-azure-vms/instant-rp-banner.jpg) 
Clicking on the banner, will open a screen for upgrading to new stack.

### PowerShell
Please execute following cmdlets from an elevated PowerShell terminal:
1.	Login to Azure Account. 

```
PS C:> Login-AzureRmAccount
```

2.	Select the subscription which you want to register for preview

```
PS C:>  Get-AzureRmSubscription –SubscriptionName "Subscription Name" | Select-AzureRmSubscription
```

3.	Register this subscription for private preview

```
PS C:>  Register-AzureRmProviderFeature -FeatureName “InstantBackupandRecovery” –ProviderNamespace Microsoft.RecoveryServices
```

##What are the some must-knows?
* This is a one-directional upgrade of the VM backup stack. So, all your future backups will go into this flow. Since it is enabled at a subscription level, all VMs will go onto this flow. All new feature additions will be based on the same stack. Ability to control this at policy level is coming in future releases. 
* For VM with premium disks, during the first backup, make sure that storage space equivalent to size of the VM is available in the storage account till first backup completes. 
* Since we store snapshots to boost recovery point creation and also to speed up restore, you will see storage costs corresponding to snapshots for the period 7 days.
For managed disks, although there is no increase in price as restorePointCollections are free. 
* If you are doing a restore from Snapshot recovery point for a Premium VM, you will see a temporary storage location being used while we create the VM as part of restore.
