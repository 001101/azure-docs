# Configure Azure Backup Reports

A common requirement for backup admins is to be able to obtain insights on backups, based on data spanning a long period of time. There could be multiple use cases for such a solution - allocating and forecasting of cloud storage consumed, auditing of backups and restores, and identifying key trends at different levels of granularity.

Today, Azure Backup provides a reporting solution that leverages Azure Log Analytics (LA) and Azure Workbooks, helping you get rich insights on your backups across your entire backup estate. This article explains how to configure and view Backup Reports.

## Supported scenarios

1) Backup Reports are supported for all types of datasources that can be backed up to Azure. (insert version limitation for DPM and Venus)
2) Backup Reports can be viewed across all backup items, vaults, subscriptions, regions as long as their data is being sent to a Log Analytics (LA) Workspace that the user has access to. 
3) If you are an [Azure Lighthouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/) user with delegated access to your customers' subscriptions, you can use these reports with Azure Lighthouse to view reports across all your tenants.
4) Data for log backup jobs is currently not displayed in the reports.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Log Analytics (LA) Workspace (or use an existing one):**

You will need to setup one or more LA Workspaces to store your backup reporting data. The location and subscription in which this LA workspace can be created is independent of the location and subscription in which your vaults exist. 

Please refer to the following article: [Create a Log Analytics Workspace in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace) to setup an LA Workspace.

By default, the data in an LA Workspace is retained for 30 days. To change the retention period, you may refer to the following article: [Manage usage and costs with Azure Monitor Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage).

2. **Configure Diagnostics Settings for your vaults:**

Azure Resource Manager resources, such as Recovery Services vaults, record information about scheduled operations and user-triggered operations as diagnostic data. 

In the monitoring section of your Recovery Services vault, select Diagnostic settings and specify the target for the Recovery Services vault's diagnostic data. [Learn more about using diagnostic events](https://aka.ms/AzureBackupDiagnosticDocs).

Azure Backup also provides a built-in Azure Policy which automates the configuration of diagnostic settings for all vaults in a given scope. Please refer to the following article to learn how to use this policy: link text

3. **View Reports on the Azure portal:**

Once you have configured your vaults to send data to LA, you can view your backup reports by navigating to any vaultâ€™s blade and clicking on the **Backup Reports** menu item. Clicking this redirects you to the Backup Report Workbook which opens up in Azure Monitor context. Below is a description of the various tabs that the report contains:

1. **Summary** - The Summary tab provides a high level overview of your backup estate. Under the Summary tab, you can get a quick glance of the total number of backup items, total cloud storage consumed, the number of protected instances and the job success rate per workload type. For more detailed information around a specific backup artifact type, you can navigate to the respective tabs.

2. **Backup Items** - The Backup Items tab allows you to see information and trends on cloud storage consumed at a Backup Item level. For example, if you are using SQL in Azure VM backup, you can see the cloud storage consumed for each SQL database being backed up. You can also choose to see data for backup items of a particular protection status. For example, clicking on the 'Protection Stopped' tile at the top of the tab filters all the below widgets to show data only for Backup Items in Protection Stopped state.

3. **Usage** - The Usage tab helps you view key billing parameters for your backups. The information shown in this tab is at a billing entity level. For example, in the case of a DPM server being backed up to Azure, you can view the trend of protected instances and cloud storage consumed for the DPM server. Similarly, if you are using SQL in Azure Backup or SAP HANA in Azure Backup, this tab gives you usage related information at the level of the virtual machine that these databases are contained in.

4. **Jobs** - The Jobs tab lets you view long running trends on jobs, such as the number of failed jobs per day and the top causes of job failure. You can view this information at both an aggregate level and at a backup item level. Clicking on a particular backup item in a grid lets you view detailed information on each job that was triggered on that backup item in the selected time range.

5. **Policies** - The Policies tab lets you view information on all of your active policies, such as the number of associated items, and the total cloud storage consumed by items backed up under a given policy. Clicking on a particular policy lets you view information on each of its associated backup items.

## Conventions used in Backup Reports

* Filters work from left to right and top to bottom on each tab.
* Data for the current partial day is not shown in the reports. Thus, when the selected value of Time Range is, say, 'Last 7 days', this shows records for the last 7 completed days (which does not include the current day).
* The report shows details of Jobs (apart from log jobs) that were **triggered** in the selected time range. 
* The values shown for Cloud Storage and Protected Instances, are as of the **end** of the selected time range.
* The Backup Items displayed in the reports are those that exist as of the **end** of the selected time range. Backup Items which were deleted in the middle of the selected time range are not displayed. The same convention applies for Backup Policies as well.

## Query Load Times

The widgets in the Backup Report are powered by Kusto queries which run on the user's LA Workspaces. As these queries typically involve the processing of large amounts of data, with multiple joins to enable richer insights, the widgets may not load instantaneously when the user is viewing reports across a large backup estate. Below is a table which provides a rough estimate of the time that different widgets can take to load, based on the number of backup items and the time range for which the report is being viewed:

## What happened to the Power BI Reports?
* Our earlier Power BI template app for reporting (which sourced data from an Azure Storage Account) is on deprecation path. It is recommended to start sending vault diagnostic data to Log Analytics as described above, to view reports. Learn more here.

* In addition, the V1 schema of sending diagnostics data to a storage account or an LA Workspace is also on deprecation path. This means that if you have written any custom queries or automations based on V1 schema, you are advised to update these queries to use the currently supported V2 schema. Learn more here.
