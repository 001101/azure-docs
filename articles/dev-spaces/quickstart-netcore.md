# Quickstart: Create a Kubernetes dev space with Azure Dev Spaces (.NET Core and VS Code)

In this guide, you will learn how to.

- Create a Kubernetes-based environment in Azure that is optimized for development - a _dev space_.
- Iteratively develop code in containers using VS Code and the command line.
- Productively develop and test your code in a team environment.

> [!Note]
> **If you get stuck** at any time, see the [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) section, or post a comment on this page.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- A Kubernetes cluster running Kubernetes 1.9.6, in the EastUS or CanadaEast region, with Http Application Routing enabled.
- Visual Studio Code, which you can download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Install the Azure CLI
Start by downloading and running the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you already have the Azure CLI installed, make sure you are using version 2.0.33 or higher.

You'll need to sign in to Azure to create our dev space. Type the following command in a terminal window:

```cmd
az login
```
## Configure your AKS cluster to use Azure Dev Spaces

Open a command window and enter the following Azure CLI command, using the resource group that contains your AKS cluster, and your AKS cluster name. The command configures your cluster with support for Azure Dev Spaces.

   ```cmd
   az aks use-dev-spaces -g MyResourceGroup -n MyAKS
   ```

## Get Kubernetes debugging for VS Code
Rich features like Kubernetes debugging are available for .NET Core and Node.js developers using VS Code.

1. Download the [VS Azure Dev Spaces extension](https://aka.ms/get-azds-code).
1. Install the extension: 

    ```cmd
    code --install-extension path-to-downloaded-extension/azds-0.1.1.vsix
    ```

While you're waiting for the cluster to be created, you can start developing code.

## Create an ASP.NET Core web app
If you have [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net) installed, you can quickly create an ASP.NET Core web app in a folder named `webfrontend`.

```cmd
   dotnet new mvc --name webfrontend
```

Or, **download sample code from GitHub** by navigating to https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces and select **Clone or Download** to download the GitHub repository to your local environment. The code for this guide is in `samples/dotnetcore/getting-started/webfrontend`.

## Preparing code for Docker and Kubernetes development
So far, you have a basic web app that can run locally. You'll now containerize it by creating assets that define the app's container and how it will deploy to Kubernetes. This is easy to do with Azure Dev Spaces: 

1. Launch VS Code and open the `webfrontend` folder. (You can ignore any default prompts to add debug assets or restore the project.)
1. Open the Integrated Terminal in VS Code (using the **View > Integrated Terminal** menu).
1. Run this command (be sure that **webfrontend** is your current folder):

    ```cmd
    azds prep --public
    ```

The Azure CLI's `azds prep` command generates Docker and Kubernetes assets with default settings:
* `./Dockerfile` describes the app's container image, and how the source code is built and runs within the container.
* A [Helm chart](https://docs.helm.sh) under `./charts/webfrontend` describes how to deploy the container to Kubernetes.
 
A file named `./azds.yaml` is also generated by the `prep` command, and it is the configuration file for Azure Dev Spaces. It complements the Docker and Kubernetes artifacts with additional configuration that enables an iterative development experience in Azure. For example, the default Helm chart does not expose any public endpoints. Sometimes, however, it is useful to temporarily open up a public endpoint during development so you can test your code, say, from a mobile device or a webhook URL. A azds.yaml file created using `azds prep --public` overrides the Helm default parameters to expose a public endpoint for development time only.

## Build and run code in Kubernetes
Let's run our code! In the terminal window, run this command from the **root code folder**, webfrontend:

```cmd
azds up
```

Keep an eye on the command's output, you'll notice several things as it progresses:
- Source code is synced to the dev space in Azure.
- A container image is built in Azure, as specified by the Docker assets in your code folder.
- Kubernetes objects are created that utilize the container image as specified by the Helm chart in your code folder.
- Information about the container's endpoint(s) is displayed. In our case, we're expecting a public HTTP URL.
- Assuming the above stages complete successfully, you should begin to see `stdout` (and `stderr`) output as the container starts up.

> [!Note]
> These steps will take longer the first time the `up` command is run, but subsequent runs should be quicker.

## Test the web app
Scan the console output for information about the public URL that was created by the `up` command. It will be in the form: 

`Running at public URL: http://<servicename>-<cluster-name>.<guid>.<region>.aksapp.io` 

Open this URL in a browser window, and you should see the web app load. As the container executes, `stdout` and `stderr` output is streamed to the terminal window.

## Update a content file
Azure Dev Spaces isn't just about getting code running in Kubernetes - it's about enabling you to quickly and iteratively see your code changes take effect in a Kubernetes environment in the cloud.

1. Locate the file `./Views/Home/Index.cshtml` and make an edit to the HTML. For example, change line 70 that reads `<h2>Application uses</h2>` to something like: `<h2>Hello k8s in Azure!</h2>`
1. Save the file. Moments later, in the Terminal window you'll see a message saying a file in the running container was updated.
1. Go to your browser and refresh the page. You should see the web page display the updated HTML.

What happened? Edits to content files, like HTML and CSS, don't require recompilation in a .NET Core web app, so an active `azds up` command automatically syncs any modified content files into the running container in Azure, so you can see your content edits right away.

## Update a code file
Updating code files requires a little more work, because a .NET Core app needs to rebuild and produce updated application binaries.

1. In the terminal window, press `Ctrl+C` (to stop `azds up`).
1. Open the code file named `Controllers/HomeController.cs`, and edit the message that the About page will display: `ViewData["Message"] = "Your application description page.";`
1. Save the file.
1. Run  `azds up` in the terminal window. 

This command rebuilds the container image and redeploys the Helm chart. To see your code changes take effect in the running application, go to the About menu in the web app.

But there is an even *faster method* for developing code, which you'll explore in the next section. 

## Debug a container in Kubernetes

In this section, you'll use VS Code to directly debug our container running in Azure. You'll also learn how to get a faster edit-run-test loop.

## Initialize debug assets with the VS Code extension
You first need to configure your code project so VS Code will communicate with our dev space in Azure. The VS Code extension for Azure Dev Spaces provides a helper command to set up debug configuration. 

Open the **Command Palette** (using the **View | Command Palette** menu), and use auto-complete to type and select this command: `Azure Dev Spaces: Create configuration files for connected development`. 

This adds debug configuration for Azure Dev Spaces under the `.vscode` folder.

> [!Important]
> Due to a bug, please close and re-open VS Code before proceeding.

### Select the AZDS debug configuration
1. To open the Debug view, click on the Debug icon in the **Activity Bar** on the side of VS Code.
1. Select **.NET Core Launch (AZDS)** as the active debug configuration.

![](media/get-started-netcore/debug-configuration.png)

> [!Note]
> If you don't see any Azure Dev Spaces commands in the Command Palette, ensure you have installed the VS Code extension for Azure Dev Spaces. Be sure the workspace you opened in VS Code is the folder that contains azds.yaml.


### Debug the container in Kubernetes
Hit **F5** to debug your code in Kubernetes.

As with the `up` command, code is synced to the dev space, and a container is built and deployed to Kubernetes. This time, of course, the debugger is attached to the remote container.

> [!Tip]
> The VS Code status bar will display a clickable URL.

![](../media/common/vscode-status-bar-url.png)

Set a breakpoint in a server-side code file, for example within the `Index()` function in the `Controllers/HomeController.cs` source file. Refreshing the browser page causes the breakpoint to hit.

You have full access to debug information just like you would if the code was executing locally, such as the call stack, local variables, exception information, etc.

### Edit code and refresh
With the debugger active, make a code edit. For example, modify the About page's message in `Controllers/HomeController.cs`. 

```csharp
public IActionResult About()
{
    ViewData["Message"] = "My custom message in the About page.";
    return View();
}
```

Save the file, and in the **Debug actions pane**, click the **Refresh** button. 

![](media/get-started-netcore/debug-action-refresh.png)

Instead of rebuilding and redeploying a new container image each time code edits are made, which will often take considerable time, Azure Dev Spaces will incrementally recompile code within the existing container to provide a faster edit/debug loop.

Refresh the web app in the browser, and go to the About page. You should see your custom message appear in the UI.

**Now you have a method for rapidly iterating on code and debugging directly in Kubernetes!**
