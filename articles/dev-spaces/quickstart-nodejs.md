# Quickstart: Create a Kubernetes dev space with Azure Dev Spaces (Node.js)

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Create a Kubernetes-based environment in Azure that is optimized for development - a _dev space_.
- Iteratively develop code in containers using VS Code and the command line.
- Productively develop and test your code in a team environment.

> [!Note]
> **If you get stuck** at any time, see the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) section, or post a comment on this page. You can also try the more detailed [tutorial](get-started-nodejs.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- A Kubernetes cluster running Kubernetes 1.9.6, in the EastUS or CanadaEast region, with Http Application Routing enabled.
- Visual Studio Code, which you can download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Install tools and configure a cluster

Follow these steps to install the tools and configure a Kubernetes cluster for Azure Dev Spaces.

### Install the Azure CLI
Start by downloading and running the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you already have the Azure CLI installed, make sure you are using version 2.0.33 or higher.

You'll need to sign in to Azure to create our dev space. Type the following command in a terminal window:

```cmd
az login
```

### Configure your AKS cluster to use Azure Dev Spaces

Open a command window and enter the following Azure CLI command, using the resource group that contains your AKS cluster, and your AKS cluster name. The command configures your cluster with support for Azure Dev Spaces.

```cmd
az aks use-dev-spaces -g MyResourceGroup -n MyAKS
```

### Get Kubernetes debugging for VS Code
Rich features like Kubernetes debugging are available for .NET Core and Node.js developers using VS Code.

1. Download the [VS Azure Dev Spaces extension](https://aka.ms/get-azds-code).
1. Install the extension: 

    ```cmd
    code --install-extension path-to-downloaded-extension/azds-0.1.1.vsix
    ```

While you're waiting for the cluster to be created, you can start developing code.

### Create a Node.js container in Kubernetes

In this section, you'll create a Node.js web app and get it running in a container in Kubernetes.

### Create a Node.js Web App
Download code from GitHub by navigating to https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces and select **Clone or Download** to download the GitHub repository to your local environment. The code for this guide is in `samples/nodejs/getting-started/webfrontend`.

## Preparing your code
So far, you have a basic web app that can run locally. You'll now containerize it by creating assets that define the app's container and how it will deploy to Kubernetes. This is easy to do with Azure Dev Spaces: 

1. Launch VS Code and open the `webfrontend` folder. (You can ignore any default prompts to add debug assets or restore the project.)
1. Open the Integrated Terminal in VS Code (using the **View > Integrated Terminal** menu).
1. Run this command (be sure that **webfrontend** is your current folder):

    ```cmd
    azds prep --public
    ```

The Azure CLI's `azds prep` command generates Docker and Kubernetes assets with default settings:
* `./Dockerfile` describes the app's container image, and how the source code is built and runs within the container.
* A [Helm chart](https://docs.helm.sh) under `./charts/webfrontend` describes how to deploy the container to Kubernetes.

For now it isn't necessary to understand the full content of these files. It's worth pointing out, however, that **the same Kubernetes and Docker configuration-as-code assets can be used from development through to production, thus providing better consistency across different environments.**
 
A file named `./azds.yaml` is also generated by the `prep` command, and it is the configuration file for Azure Dev Spaces. It complements the Docker and Kubernetes artifacts with additional configuration that enables an iterative development experience in Azure. For example, the default Helm chart does not expose any public endpoints. Sometimes, however, it is useful to temporarily open up a public endpoint during development so you can test your code, say, from a mobile device or a webhook URL. A azds.yaml file created using `azds prep --public` overrides the Helm default parameters to expose a public endpoint for development time only.


## Build and run code in Kubernetes
Let's run our code! In the terminal window, run this command from the **root code folder**, webfrontend:

```cmd
azds up
```

Keep an eye on the command's output, you'll notice several things as it progresses:
- Source code is synced to the dev space in Azure.
- A container image is built in Azure, as specified by the Docker assets in your code folder.
- Kubernetes objects are created that utilize the container image as specified by the Helm chart in your code folder.
- Information about the container's endpoint(s) is displayed. In our case, we're expecting a public HTTP URL.
- Assuming the above stages complete successfully, you should begin to see `stdout` (and `stderr`) output as the container starts up.

> [!Note]
> These steps will take longer the first time the `up` command is run, but subsequent runs should be quicker.

### Test the web app
Scan the console output for information about the public URL that was created by the `up` command. It will be in the form: 

`Running at public URL: http://<servicename>-<cluster-name>.<guid>.<region>.aksapp.io` 

Open this URL in a browser window, and you should see the web app load. As the container executes, `stdout` and `stderr` output is streamed to the terminal window.

### Update a content file
Azure Dev Spaces isn't just about getting code running in Kubernetes - it's about enabling you to quickly and iteratively see your code changes take effect in a Kubernetes environment in the cloud.

1. Locate the file `./public/index.html` and make an edit to the HTML. For example, change the page's background color to a shade of blue:

    ```html
    <body style="background-color: #95B9C7; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">
    ```

2. Save the file. Moments later, in the Terminal window you'll see a message saying a file in the running container was updated.
1. Go to your browser and refresh the page. You should see your color update.

What happened? Edits to content files, like HTML and CSS, don't require the Node.js process to restart, so an active `azds up` command will automatically sync any modified content files directly into the running container in Azure, thereby providing a fast way to see your content edits.

### Test from a mobile device
If you open the web app on a mobile device, you will notice that the UI does not display properly on a small device.

To fix this, you'll add a `viewport` meta tag:
1. Open the file `./public/index.html`
1. Add a `viewport` meta tag in the existing `head` element:

    ```html
    <head>
        <!-- Add this line -->
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    </head>
    ```

1. Save the file.
1. Refresh your device's browser. You should now see the web app rendered correctly. 

This is an example of how some problems just aren't found until you test on the devices where an app is meant to be used. With Azure Dev Spaces, you can rapidly iterate on your code and validate any changes on target devices.

### Update a code file
Updating server-side code files requires a little more work, because a Node.js app needs to restart.

1. In the terminal window, press `Ctrl+C` (to stop `azds up`).
1. Open the code file named `server.js`, and edit service's hello message: 

    ```javascript
    res.send('Hello from webfrontend running in Azure!');
    ```

3. Save the file.
1. Run  `azds up` in the terminal window. 

This rebuilds the container image and redeploys the Helm chart. Reload the browser page to see your code changes take effect.

But there is an even *faster method* for developing code, which you'll explore in the next section. 

## Debug a container in Kubernetes

In this section, you'll use VS Code to directly debug our container running in Azure. You'll also learn how to get a faster edit-run-test loop.

### Initialize debug assets with the VS Code extension
You first need to configure your code project so VS Code will communicate with our dev space in Azure. The VS Code extension for Azure Dev Spaces provides a helper command to set up debug configuration. 

Open the **Command Palette** (using the **View | Command Palette** menu), and use auto-complete to type and select this command: `Azure Dev Spaces: Create configuration files for connected development`. 

This adds debug configuration for Azure Dev Spaces under the `.vscode` folder.

![](./media/common/command-palette.png)

> [!Important]
> Due to a bug, please close and re-open VS Code before proceeding.

### Select the AZDS debug configuration
1. To open the Debug view, click on the Debug icon in the **Activity Bar** on the side of VS Code.
1. Select **Launch Program (AZDS)** as the active debug configuration.

![](media/get-started-node/debug-configuration-nodejs.png)

> [!Note]
> If you don't see any Azure Dev Spaces commands in the Command Palette, ensure you have installed the VS Code extension for Azure Dev Spaces.

### Debug the container in Kubernetes
Hit **F5** to debug your code in Kubernetes!

Similar to the `up` command, code is synced to the dev space when you start debugging, and a container is built and deployed to Kubernetes. This time, the debugger is attached to the remote container.

> [!Tip]
> The VS Code status bar will display a clickable URL.

![](./media/common/vscode-status-bar-url.png)

Set a breakpoint in a server-side code file, for example within the `app.get('/api'...` in  `server.js`. Refresh the browser page, or press the 'Say It Again' button, and you should hit the breakpoint and be able to step through code.

You have full access to debug information just like you would if the code was executing locally, such as the call stack, local variables, exception information, etc.

### Edit code and refresh the debug session
With the debugger active, make a code edit; for example, modify the hello message again:

```javascript
app.get('/api', function (req, res) {
    res.send('**** Hello from webfrontend running in Azure! ****');
});
```

Save the file, and in the **Debug actions pane**, click the **Refresh** button. 

![](media/get-started-node/debug-action-refresh-nodejs.png)

Instead of rebuilding and redeploying a new container image each time code edits are made, which will often take considerable time, Azure Dev Spaces will restart the Node.js process in between debug sessions to provide a faster edit/debug loop.

Refresh the web app in the browser, or press the *Say It Again* button. You should see your custom message appear in the UI.

### Use NodeMon to develop even faster
*Nodemon* is a popular tool that Node.js developers use for rapid development. Instead of manually restarting the Node process each time a server-side code edit is made, developers will often configure their Node project to have *nodemon* monitor file changes and automatically restart the server process. In this style of working, the developer just refreshes their browser after making a code edit.

With Azure Dev Spaces, you can use many of the same development workflows you use when developing locally. To illustrate this, the sample `webfrontend` project was configured to use *nodemon* (it is configured as a dev dependency in `package.json`).

Try the following steps:
1. Stop the VS Code debugger.
1. Click on the Debug icon in the **Activity Bar** on the side of VS Code. 
1. Select **Attach (AZDS)** as the active debug configuration.
1. Hit F5.

In this configuration, the container is configured to start *nodemon*. When server code edits are made, *nodemon* automatically restarts the Node process, just like it does when you develop locally. 
1. Edit the hello message again in `server.js`, and save the file.
1. Refresh the browser, or click the *Say It Again* button, to see your changes take effect!

**Now you have a method for rapidly iterating on code and debugging directly in Kubernetes!**
