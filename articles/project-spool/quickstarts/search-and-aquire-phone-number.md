# Search and acquire a phone number on Azure Communication Services portal

Before proceeding, please review the [Plan you Telephony and SMS solution](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/concepts/voice/plan-your-telephony-and-sms-solution/) concept document

The wizard on the "Phone number" portal will walk you through a series of questions to define the right choice of numbers for your scenario.
When you start selecting the number, you define the ["Number Type"](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/concepts/voice/plan-your-telephony-and-sms-solution#phone-number-types-in-microsoft-direct-offer/) and select ["Plans"](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/concepts/voice/plan-your-telephony-and-sms-solution?branch=pr-en-us-104477#plans/) appropriately for your project.

You can pick a toll-free number, enable one way inbound calling on it and two way SMS, or select the same toll-free number as the caller ID (what users see when you call them from your ACS application) for outbound calling.
On the next step, the wizard will ask you for the purpose of using the number. We collect the purpose of using the phone numbers to apply the right taxes and emergency calling regulations.

To make or receive calls or send/receive SMS messages you need to consider two prices:
- Monthly recurring charge for the selected phone number. This is a fee for the number renting
- Cost to make or receive calls, based on pay as you go model. The price lists available here [LINK] Calling prices depend on number type and destination called. For example, price per minute for a call from a Seattle regional number to a regional number in New York and a call from the same number to a UK mobile number may be different.

On the last screen, you will see the price, tax information and can complete your order
