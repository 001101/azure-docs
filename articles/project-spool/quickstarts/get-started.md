## Get Started With Azure Communication Services

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to create and manage your first Azure Communication Services resource.

### Prerequisites
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).

### Create an Azure Communication Services Resource

1. To create an Azure Communication Services resource, first sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). In the upper-left side of the page, select **+ Create a resource**. In the **Search the Marketplace** text box, enter **Azure Communication Service**.

2. Select **Azure Communication Service** in the results, and select **Create**. 

3. On the new **Azure Communication Service** settings page, add the following settings for your new Azure Communication Service

4. Select **Create**. The deployment might take a few minutes to complete

5. After the deployment is complete, Select **Keys**  under **Settings**. Copy your connection string for the primary key. You'll use this string later to configure your app to use the Azure Communication Service resource. 


### Manage your Communication Service

To manage your Communication Service, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and search for and select **Azure Communication Services**.

On the **Communication Services** page, select the name of your web app.

The **Overview** page for your web app, contains options for basic management like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete. The left menu provides further pages for configuring your app.
