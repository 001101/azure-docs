-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know how to allow my users to call someone's cell phone from my app.
   - I want to know how to route incoming calls to one of my staff.
   - I want to know how to provision a phone number for making and receiving phone calls.

- Resources: 
  - [Spool Contributor Quickstart](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/contribute?branch=pr-en-us-104477)

- Gold Standard Docs:
  - TODO

- Discussion:
  - {shawn} This is about more than just web services - simple outbound scenarios may be mature, but Spool's offering includes "inbound IVR scenarios". This isn't coming in as soon - still needs work. 
  - {shawn} While there's a mature M365 SDK, leveraging through spool isn't very easy.
  - This may be one of the more mature features

- TODOs:
  - Draft initial content
