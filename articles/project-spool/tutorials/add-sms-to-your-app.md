#### Temporary:

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know how to send SMS messages to my users.
   - I want to know how to receive and process SMS messages.
   - I want to know how to provision a phone number for sending and receiving SMS messages.
   - I want to know how to send MMS messages to my users.

- Resources: 
  - [Spool Contributor Quickstart](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/contribute?branch=pr-en-us-104477)

- Gold Standard Docs:
  - TODO

- Discussion:
  - {shawn} This is about more than just web services - simple outbound scenarios may be mature, but Spool's offering includes "inbound IVR scenarios". This isn't coming in as soon - still needs work. 
  - {shawn} While there's a mature M365 SDK, leveraging through spool isn't very easy.

- TODOs:
  - Find related gold standard docs
  - Draft initial content
