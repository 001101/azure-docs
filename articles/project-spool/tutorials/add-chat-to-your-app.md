# Add Real-Time Chat to Your App

TODO


#### meta:

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I'm building an app that allows users to chat, and I want to use Spool to make that easy.

- Discussion:
  - {shawn} Disambiguation needed RE RTC / chat apis
  - I've heard that we're offering "persistent chat", and also that customers will be 100% responsible for storage. Is Spool offering tightly-coupled storage, or will our customers roll their own persistance?
