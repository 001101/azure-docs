#### Temporary:

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I'm building an app that allows users to chat, and I want to use Spool to make that easy.

- Resources: 
  - [Spool Contributor Quickstart](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/contribute?branch=pr-en-us-104477)

- Gold Standard Docs:
  - TODO

- Discussion:
  - {shawn} Disambiguation needed RE RTC / chat apis
  - I've heard that we're offering "persistent chat", and also that customers will be 100% responsible for storage. Is Spool offering tightly-coupled storage, or will our customers roll their own persistance?  

- TODOs:
  - Draft initial content
