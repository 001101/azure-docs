#### Temporary:

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I need to send messages from one client to other clients and/or my server. I'd like to use Spool to make this easy. I don't need persistent storage - just transient signaling. I'll handle the processing and storage.

- Resources: 
  - [Spool Contributor Quickstart](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/contribute?branch=pr-en-us-104477)

- TODOs:
  - Draft initial content
