# How Voice, Video, and Messaging Relate

TODO

### meta

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know how programmable voice, video, and messaging relate to one another. Is there overlap? Are they complementary? How do they relate to the SDKs?

- Resources: 
  - [Spool Contributor Quickstart](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/contribute?branch=pr-en-us-104477)

- Discussion:
  - Is the programmable voice / video / messaging split valid?
  - If so, how do these each relate to each other and the SDKs we'll be offering?
