# Metrics overview

## Where to find measures
Metrics will be available in the blades for each primitive type under the 'Metrics' tab at the top. This view only shows the metrics for that specific primitive. It comes with a pre-canned view, but is configurable if there are other measures you would like to pin in place.

All measures for all primitive types and service-wide data points (i.e. authentication) will be available and searchable in this view.

## Metric definitions

### Filters

By Namespace
By Time


### VoIP Calling

| Metric name | Definition | Notes |
|-----|:------------:| :------------:|
|Call Duration|Total duration of the call per participant in a meeting|In Minutes|
|Packet loss rate >10% or 0.1|The percentage of packets that are lost. Packet loss directly affects audio qualityâ€”from small, individual lost packets that have almost no impact to back-to-back burst losses that cause audio to cut out completely.
|Round-trip time >500 ms|Average round-trip network propagation time|in milliseconds.
