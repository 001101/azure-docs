# Metrics overview

## Where to find measures
Metrics will be available in the blades for each primitive type under the 'Metrics' tab at the top. This view only shows the metrics for that specific primitive. It comes with a pre-canned view, but is configurable if there are other measures you would like to pin in place.

All measures for all primitive types and service-wide data points (i.e. authentication) will be available and searchable in this view.

## Metric definitions

### Filters

By Namespace
By Time


### VoIP Calling

| Metric name | Definition | Notes |
|-----|:------------:| :------------:|
| Total calling minutes |  |  |
| Total calls |  | Group calls count as one call |
| Call Drop Failure Rate | The drop failure rate, otherwise known as the Total Call Dropped Failure Percentage measurement in CQD, is the percentage of successfully established streams where the media path didn’t terminate normally. |  |
| Packet Loss Rate | Average packet loss rate for stream. |  |
| Round Trip Time | Average round-trip network propagation time, computed in milliseconds. |  |
| Call Setup Failure Rate |  | The setup failure rate, otherwise known as the Total Call Setup Failure Percentage measurement in CQD, is the number of streams where the media path couldn’t be established between the endpoints at the start of the call. |

todo: [Use this CQD template to assess your quality](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/quality-of-experience-review-guide)
