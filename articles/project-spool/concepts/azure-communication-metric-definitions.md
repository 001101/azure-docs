# Metrics overview

## Where to find measures
Metrics will be available in the blades for each primitive type under the 'Metrics' tab at the top. This view only shows the metrics for that specific primitive. It comes with a pre-canned view, but is configurable if there are other measures you would like to pin in place.

All measures for all primitive types and service-wide data points (i.e. authentication) will be available and searchable in this view.
