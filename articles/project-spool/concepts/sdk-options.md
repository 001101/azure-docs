-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know what the Spool SDK story is. How many SDKs are there? When do I use each one?

- Resources: 
  - [Spool Contributor Quickstart](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/contribute?branch=pr-en-us-104477)

- Gold Standard Docs:
  - TODO

- Discussion:
  - What SDKs are we offering?
  - Are Azure and IC3 developing their own SDKs that leverage one another? What's that relationship look like?
  - I've heard that we're offering a "quickstart" SDK and then another SDK that gives users the ability to fine-tune their configuration / integration. Can we elaborate on this?

- TODOs:
  - Draft initial content
