# SDKs Options

ACS capabilities are conceptually organized into 7 areas, which align to packaged assembles and API namespaces where appropriate for the language. Some areas have fully open-sourced SDKs and can be directly accessed over the network. These open-source SDKs can be found in the Azure SDK GitHub repository. The Calling APIs use proprietary network interfaces and require packaged libraries built by the ACS team.

Assembly    | Protocols| Namespaces| Capabilities
----|----|---|---|
Azure Resource Manager | REST    | Azure.Management.Communication |Control plane, Provision ACS resources
Common|    REST    |Azure.Communication|Bases types for other areas, APIs for telemetry, creating rooms, token management
Data Plane Management|REST|Azure.Communication|   Manage phone numbers, rooms, etc.
Chat |    REST |Azure.Communication.Chat| Leverage threaded rich text chat.
SMS |     REST | Azure.Communication.SMS|    Send and receive SMS messages.
Calling |     Proprietary transport |Azure.Communication.Calling | Leverage voice, video, screen-sharing, and other real-time data communication capabilities. 
Network Traversal    | REST, RFC 5389 STUN, RFC 5766 TURN | Azure.Communication.Networking | Create STUN and TURN servers and access their traversal capabilities  

ACS provides SDKs for several languages, and where applicable publishes built libraries for those languages in an appropriate public repository.

Language | Optimized forâ€¦| Packaging
-|-|-|
Azure CLI|    Command line management on both Windows and Linux    | pypi, Azure cloud shell
.NET | Cross-platform | NuGet
Python | Windows & Linux Servers |    Pypi
Java (J2EE)    | JVM on Windows or Linux Servers |    Maven
Swift |    iOS client applications    | CocoaPods
Java (Android) |    Android client applications    | Maven
JavaScript |    Browser client applications and Node |    Npm


Current availability guidance and timelines for individual SDK packages are collated below. During the private preview these timelines will change signficiantly as we incorporate customer feedback and balance engineering priorities.
