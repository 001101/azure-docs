# Signaling

TODO

### meta

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know what Spool Signaling is and how it helps me help my customers.

- Discussion:
  - Are signaling primitives being developed?
  - Signaling feels like an overloaded term. What exactly does it mean in the context of Spool?
  - Signaling is used for everything - without it there is no solution - so it will be exposed to the customer. But the way that it's exposed is TBD, right?
  - Timing and scope are still TBD here?
  - Does signaling offer any value beyond facilitating other Spool features?
