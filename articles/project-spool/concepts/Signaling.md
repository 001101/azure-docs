# Signaling

TODO

### meta

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know what Spool Signaling is and how it helps me help my customers.

- Discussion:
  - Signaling feels like an overloaded term. What exactly does it mean in the context of Spool?
  - Signaling is used for everything - without it there is no solution - so it will be exposed to the customer. How are we exposing it to our customers through our SDKs / APIs?
  - Does signaling offer any value beyond facilitating other Spool features? Is there any way it be valuable as a standalone feature?
