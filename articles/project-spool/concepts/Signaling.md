-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know what Spool Signaling is and how it helps me help my customers.

- Resources: 
  - [Spool Contributor Quickstart](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/project-spool/contribute?branch=pr-en-us-104477)

- Gold Standard Docs:
  - TODO

- Discussion:
  - Are signaling primitives being developed by Azure?
  - Signaling feels like an overloaded term. What exactly does it mean in the context of Spool?
  - Signaling is used for everything - without it there is no solution - so it will be exposed to the customer. But the way that it's exposed is TBD.
  - Timing and scope are still TBD here.
  - Does signaling offer any value beyond facilitating other Spool features?


- TODOs:
  - Draft initial content
