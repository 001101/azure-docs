## SMS

SMS is a powerful channel for organizations to reach and interact with their end-users in a timely and convenient way. Azure Communication Services enables you to send and receive SMS text messages through your applications with ease for improved customer satisfaction with minimal setup process. You can use ACS REST APIs, JS, Python, .NET SDKs to build applications that allow your users to send and receive messages for supporting use cases like customer service, appointment reminders, two factor authentication, etc.,. You can reliably send messages and get deeper insights into deliverability and response rates for tracking the success of your campaigns. Further channels like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, etc,. will be supported in the near future. 

In order to send a text message, you need: 

- **An Azure Communication Services Resource**. This quick-start (here) shows you how to provision one. 

- **An ACS configured phone number**. Sending SMS messages requires a telephone number, which ACS can help you obtain easily. You can assign these phone numbers to your applications/bots to enable send/receive capabilities on the phone number. Check out the quick start for telephone number management for more information.
