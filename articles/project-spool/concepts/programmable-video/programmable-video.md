# Programmable Video

Spool's SDKs and APIs allow you to add video and voice chat to your applications.

The flow supporting video calls looks like this:

1. Provision a Spool API key
2. Create a server application
2. Create a Space 
3. Your clients request access tokens
4. Your server app returns the access tokens
5. Your clients then connect to the Space
6. Your clients then share their video, audio, and data.
