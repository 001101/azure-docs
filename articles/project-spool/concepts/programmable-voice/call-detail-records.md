# Call Detail Records

TODO

### meta

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know how my provisioned phone numbers are being used.

- Discussion:
  - Should this be grouped with Call Analytics under a "Call Metadata" page, or are these concepts different enough to justify individual pages?
  - What do we want our customers to know about Call Detail Record?
  - Should we refer to any samples, quickstarts, or other pages from this page?
