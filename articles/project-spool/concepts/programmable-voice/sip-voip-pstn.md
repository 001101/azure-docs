# SIP, VoIP, PSTN, and Spool

SIP, VoIP, and PSTN are each technologies that help people connect to each other.

## SIP

SIP stands for Session Initiation Protocol. It's a signaling protocol used to initiate multimedia communications like phone calls, video calls, and data transfers.

SIP trunks route data from one phone to another by connecting an organization to the Internet Telephony Service Provider.


## VoIP

VoIP stands for Voice over IP. It's how people can have phone calls over the internet. When you call a PSTN number over VoIP, your call is transmitted through an exchange.


## PSTN

PSTN stands for Public Switched Telephone Network. It's the technology that supports plain-old landline telephony.

  - What other technologies should we tie together on this page?
  - How should we "tie it all together with spool"?
  - When do our customers need to care about these technologies?
  - Should we reference any sample(s) from this page?
  - Is the draft technically accurate?
