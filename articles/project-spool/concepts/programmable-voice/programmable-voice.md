# Programmable Voice

Spool's SDKs and APIs help you make and receive phone calls from within your applications.

You can use Spool to make and receive calls, analyze call metadata, host conference calls, record calls, and even build call trees. Your calls aren't restricted to plain-old telephone numbers - you can use Spool to call browser clients and mobile apps as well.

The flow supporting voice calls looks like this:

1. Provision a Spool API key
2. TODO
