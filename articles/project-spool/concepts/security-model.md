# Security Model

TODO


### meta

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know what the overall security model of Spool looks like.
   - I'm worried that my customers have security concerns (see: zoom) and I don't know how to reassure them.

- Discussion:
  - What information can we provide to users who are concerned about security?
  - What kinds of security-related patterns and practices should developers keep in mind?
