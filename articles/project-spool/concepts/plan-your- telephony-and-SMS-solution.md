## About phone numbers in Azure Communications Services

Azure Communication Services allows you to use phone numbers to receive telephony calls and send or receive SMS messages. You also can use phone numbers in your caller ID on outbound calls.  Microsoft offers a variety of options depending on the country and your needs.
If you want just to try Azure Communications Services or build a new project with no requirements to bring the existing phone number, the simplest way would be to get a new phone number from Microsoft in a matter of minutes.


Note Microsoft does not provide voice telephony services in each country. We keep expanding the countries rapidly. If your country is not served by Microsoft directly, you can interconnect the telephony via the SIP interface on your own or with our partners' help. The SIP interface does not allow interconnection with your own carrier for sending and receiving the SMS
