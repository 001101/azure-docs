# Add Signaling to Your App

TODO


#### meta:

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I need to send messages from one client to other clients and/or my server. I'd like to use Spool to make this easy. I don't need persistent storage - just transient signaling. I'll handle the processing and storage.

- Discussion:
  - Is this an actual scenario?
  - {Bala} - It may not be... signaling is everywhere. You don't add it, you leverage it.
  - Do we need this doc?
