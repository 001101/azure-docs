# About Azure Communication Services

Azure Communication Services (ACS) allows you to easily add real-time communications features to your applications.

When you use ACS, you're building on top of the same infrastructure that powers Skype and Teams. This allows you to seamlessly scale and integrate your offerings with other Azure services like Cortana, Microsoft Graph, Cognitive Services, Bot Framework, and Machine Learning.

You'll use the ACS SDKs to connect your users to cross-platform sessions that facilitate real-time voice, video, and messaging.

There are three primary capabilities that ACS offers: Voice, Video, and Chat.
