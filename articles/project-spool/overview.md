- **Discussion**:
  - This is where we relate Spool to other offerings.
  - Our conceptual model needs to match existing WebRTC conceptual docs offered by mozilla / webrtc.org. Ours will just be articulated in terms of Microsoft Azure / Spool - including data channels, lifetime management, etc.

- Gold Standard Docs:
  - https://webrtc.org/getting-started/overview

# Project Spool overview

Project Spool allows you to easily add calling and messaging to your apps without worrying about real-time communications infrastructure. 

When you use Spool, you're building on top of the same infrastructure that powers Skype and Teams. This gives you the option to seamlessly scale and integrate your communications functionality with other Azure services like Cortana, Microsoft Graph, Cognitive Services, Bot Framework, and Machine Learning.

The Spool SDK is used to create cross-platform "sessions" that clients then connect to. These sessions facilitate real-time messaging, voice, and video communications between clients and networks.


## Examples

Some example use cases enabled by Project Spool include:

- **E-Learning**: Connect students to teachers so that they can review material together with real-time video chat and white-boarding.
- **Call Centers**: Reserve a phone number via Spool and connect your customers to your staff.
- **Home Security**: Build an app that live-streams webcam footage to all of your devices while storing media whenever motion is detected.
- **Group Chat**: Build an internal Skype clone that integrates with your organization's ecosystem.
- **Telehealth**: Easily connect healthcare providers to their patients.
- **Disaster Response**: Build an app that connects first responders to remote emergency response teams.
- **Tech Support**: Allow your customers to share their screens with your staff for a seamless customer support experience.

Project Spool is a managed Azure service that you build upon by using the Spool server-side and client-side SDKs.
