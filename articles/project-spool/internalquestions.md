## Internal Questions

- {mick} **Would you prefer to keep meta-documentation here, or in our OneNote?**
- {mick} Our Contributor's Guide recommends starting out with 10-15 use-cases.  **What are those use-cases?**  Some ideas:
  - Send and receive MMS/SMS text messages.
  - Make and receive voice calls to phone numbers through PSTNs.
  - Make and receive voice calls to phone numbers through VOIP.
  - Make and receive voice calls to any device without a phone number.
  - Build real-time chat into your application.
  - Let your users participate in group [calls, text messages, and web chats].
  - Broadcast messages to a group of devices.
  - Add web video chat into your app.
  - Add web video chat (across NATs / firewalls) into your app.
  - Send push notifications to Android and iOS devices.
  - Send media files to devices.
  - Let your users share their screens.
  - Route your business phone number to a bot
  - Eventually – message directly to Twitter, Whatsapp, Facebook, and others.
- {mick} As I prioritize our use-cases and quickstarts, I'm wondering about our launch strategy.  **Who is our "early adopter" and what scenarios would appeal to them?**
- {mick} I'm tempted to apply some of the lessons I've learned from my entrepreneurial endeavors as we craft our content.  One of those lessons is to deliver a crisp, minimal painkiller - something that alleviates so much pain with so much clarity that our users would be *very* disappointed if our solution didn't exist.  This is related to some of the things I've learned about product-market fit - specifically, [the 40% rule](https://uxplanet.org/understanding-product-market-fit-from-start-to-finish-596a4653814).   **What Spool capabilities do our users *have* to have?  Should I focus on building out docs to support those?**
- {mick} **Do we have a "showcase app" that we can integrate with our docs?**
- {mick} When I built my home security app, I primarily depended upon [this resource](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/) to learn WebRTC.  This gave me "building block" samples that I could combine without depending too much on documentation.  **As we build our docs, should we build a corresponding collection of "building block samples" like this that utilizes a prepaid Nexus**?  I'm envisioning something very similar to the WebRTC samples app - a minimal, interactive, usable, sharable, plug-and-playable collection of building blocks that link back to the docs.
- {mick} **What tutorials would you like to prioritize?**
  - Call another device for nearly* free (via WebRTC / STUN)
  - Call your phone
  - Send an SMS message
  - Send an MMS message
  - Build group chat for nearly* free
  - Build a puppy/baby monitor for nearly* free (WebRTC / STUN)
  - Connect a driver to a passenger for nearly* free
  - Build a mini call center for nearly* free
  - **{asterisk}** It seems that WebRTC + SignalR empower highly technical devs to do this, right now.  But there’s a high technical barrier to entry that our SDKs might reduce.  Is our business model focused on empowering less experienced devs with our SDKs, and then monetizing *after* we’ve empowered?  Or are we directly targeting the monetizable NAT traversal / telephony needs from the outset?  
- {mick} **Should I connect with our Marketing team to ensure that our stories and language are aligned?**
- {mick} **Should I be concerned with capturing feedback from alpha/beta users?**  If so, how do I access them, and what protocol should I follow?
- {mick} Should I see myself as carrying some marketing and evangelism responsibility?  If so...
  - I'm thinking that I should try to align our content with the stories that would excite our users the most.  **Which of our stories elicit the most love from our vocal evangelists?**
  - In my experience, early adopters tend to skew young and liberal.  **Should I focus my quickstarts and samples on builder-friendly scenarios** (e.g. a STUN puppy monitor instead of a TURN Skype clone)?
- {mick} **Is it possible to utilize Spool's clientside SDK as a way to "get started with WebRTC", without using the serverside SDK?**  Question context: one of my biggest pain-points with WebRTC was facilitating the ICE/STUN handshake protocol in JS with multiple webcams feeding streams and alerts to multiple monitoring devices.  I'm wondering if Spool would help me simplify my STUN-based implementation, and then later if I want to traverse NATs, I can hook into the paid TURN offering + serverside goodies.
- {mick}  **Do I (or other spool users) need to be aware of IC3, its gateway, or anything beyond the gateway?**.  Question context: I'm usually developing my projects under an extremely limited time and money budget, so the simpler and more intuitive things are, the more excited I get.
- {mick} **Will our product ever expose “SignalR” terminology or concepts to the developer**, or are we tucking that away behind a layer of abstraction?
   - **If we are tucking it away, will the developer be able to configure the signaling transport protocol**?  Question context: When working with SignalR on a budget, I’ve often run into limits with WebSockets at the lower-level app service tiers.  These limits were not always easy to diagnose.  I usually start with “long-polling” and then later, once my product has been validated and I need to scale, I'd optimize towards modern protocols and unit-test those upgrades in isolation.
- {mick} - RE "Nexus" - I see that this term isn’t set in stone, and that you’re looking for suggestions.  SignalR utilizes “Hub” to describe the class through which all I/O travels within an application, and uses “Group” to cluster recipients within Hubs.  I see Spool utilizes the "Group" concept.  My natural inclination here would be to refer to “nexuses” as “hubs” since it's already part of my lexicon. **Thoughts?**
- {mick} - **Is [this the guide](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/COSINE-DEP-Spool?path=%2Fdoc%2Fguide%2Fgetting_started.md&_a=preview) that I should use to study Spool code from the perspective of a "new spool developer"**?
- {mick} - Would it be useful for you to see a recurring digest of the real-time social media chatter surrounding WebRTC, Twilio, and other related tech / competitors?  For example - all Reddit conversations over the past week that are related to implementing WebRTC in a C# app?
- {mick} - Amazon recently started inviting me to Developer Huddles.  Do our product releases incorporate something like this?
