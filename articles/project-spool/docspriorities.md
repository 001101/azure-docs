## Priorities

1. Define our highest-priority use-cases. **[We are here]**
2. Determine how to auto-generate API Reference Docs [pending correspondence...].
2. Build a minimum-viable quickstart for one of our use-cases, including supporting reference, conceptual, and architecture materials.  Possibly including the corresponding sample in our demo app.  Get a feel for how long it takes to build out a MVP use-case from end-to-end.
3. With this time-cost awareness, plan out our other use-cases and content plan with weekly goals along the Private Preview / Build / General Availability timeline.
4. Review and adjust on at least a weekly basis - ideally incorporating MVP or internal user feedback along the way.
