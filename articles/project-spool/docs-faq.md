Q: How do support code snippets across multiple languages within my docs?

A: An example of tabs:

#### [C#](#tab/c-sharp)

<!--- Content here  -->

#### [Javascript](#tab/javascript)

<!--- Content here  -->

--- 

This was generated with the following markdown:

``` 
#### [C#](#tab/c-sharp)

<!--- Content here  -->

#### [Javascript](#tab/javascript)

<!--- Content here  -->
--- 
```

The three dashes close out the tabbed conceptual entry.
