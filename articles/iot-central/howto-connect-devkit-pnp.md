## Prepare th DevKit device

1. Download the latest [pre-built Azure IoT Central firmware](https://github.com/MXCHIP/IoTDevKit/raw/master/pnp/iotc_devkit/bin/iotc_devkit.bin) for the MXChip from GitHub.

1. Connect the DevKit device to your development machine using a USB cable. In Windows, a file explorer window opens on a drive mapped to the storage on the DevKit device. For example, the drive might be called **AZ3166 (D:)**.

1. Drag the **iotc_devkit.bin** file onto the drive window. When the copying is complete, the device reboots with the new firmware.

1. On the DevKit, hold down **button B**, push and release the **Reset** button, and then release **button B**. The device is now in access point (AP) mode. To confirm, the screen displays "IoT DevKit - AP" and configuration portal IP address.

1. On your computer or tablet connect to the WiFi network name shown on the screen of the device. The WiFi network starts with **AZ-** followed by the MAC address. When you connect to this network, you don't have internet access. This state is expected, and you're only connected to this network for a short time while you configure the device.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://192.168.0.1/](http://192.168.0.1/). The following web page displays:

    ![Config UI](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/config-ui.jpg)

    On the web page, enter:

    - The name of your WiFi network (SSID)
    - Your WiFi network password
    - The connection details **Scope ID**, **Registration ID** (Device ID), and **Symmetric key** of your device (you should have already saved this following the steps)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Currently, the IoT DevKit only can connect to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, 5 GHz is not supported due to hardware restrictions.

1. After choose **Save**, the DevKit will reboot and runs the application.

    ![Reboot UI](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/reboot-ui.png)

Now the DevKit starts sending data to your IoT Central application. You can open serial monitor to see the device output log.

1. Download the serial client such as [Tera Term](https://tera-term.en.lo4d.com/windows).

1. Connect the DevKit to your computer by USB.

1. Open Tera Term, select **serial**, and then expand the port. The device should appear as an STMicroelectronics device. Choose **STMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port**. Click OK.

   ![Select COM poart](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/select-port.png)

1. Click **Setup** on the menu bar, select **serial port**, and configure the connection speed to **115200** baud. Then choose **OK** to open the serial monitor.

   ![Select COM speed](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/configure-speed.png)

1. You can see the output log in the Window.

## View the telemetry in IoT Central

In this step, you view the telemetry and reported property values, and send commands in Azure IoT Central.

1. In your IoT Central application, select **Devices** tab, select the device you added. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the telemetry coming from the DevKit.

   ![IoT Central device overview](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/overview-page.png)

1. In the **About** tab, you can view the properties reported by the DevKit.

   ![IoT Central device property](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/property-page.png)

1. In the **Form** tab, you can set **Current**, **Fan Speed**, **Voltage** and **IR**, which are writable properties.

   ![IoT Central device form](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/form-page.png)

1. In the **Commands** page, you can call the commands to execute actions on the DevKit. For example, you run **turnOnLED** command.

   ![Turn on LED](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/turn-on-LED.png)

   On the device, view command executed successfully log in the serial monitor. To confirm, see the **User LED** on DevKit board on.

## Download the source code

If you want to explore and modify the device code, you can download it from GitHub. If you plan to modify the code, you should follow these instructions to [prepare the development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-arduino-iot-devkit-az3166-get-started#prepare-the-development-environment) for your desktop operating system.

1. To download sample code for DevKit, run the following command on your desktop machine.

   ```cmd/sh
   git clone https://github.com/MXCHIP/IoTDevKit.git
   ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If **git** is not installed in your development environment, you can download it from [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download).

1. The source code is located in `pnp/iotc_devkit` folder.

## Review the code

Open repository folder, navigate to pnp/iotc_devkit, then open **iotc_devkit.code-workspace** file with VS Code.

![open-workspace](media/howto-connect-devkit-pnp/open-workspace.png)

To see how the telemetry is sent to the Azure IoT Central application, open the sensor_interface.c file.

- The function `SensorsInterface_Telemetry_SendAll` sends multiple telemetries including humidity, temperature, pressure, magnetometer, gyroscope and accelerometer .
- The functions `Sensors_Serialize{XXXX}` in digitaltwin_serializer.c create the telemetry payload, using `Sensors_Telemetry_Read{XXXX}`functions in mxchip_iot_devkit_impl.c to get data from the sensors on the DevKit device.

To see how property values are reported to the Azure IoT Central application, open the deviceinfo_interface.c file.

- The function `DeviceinfoInterface_Property_ReportAll` sends properties including manufacturer, device model, software version, operating system name, processor architecture, processor manufacturer, total storage and total memory.
- The functions from line 213 to 419 in digitaltwin_serializer.c create the property payload.

To see how the DevKit device responds to commands for LED actions called from the IoT Central application, open the leds_interface.c file.

- The function `LedsInterface_Command_TurnOnLedCallback` processes the turnOnLed command. It uses `Leds_Command_TurnOnLed` function in mxchip_iot_devkit_impl.c to turn on the User LED.
- The function `LedsInterface_Command_BlinkCallback` processes the blink command. It uses `Leds_Command_Blink` function in mxchip_iot_devkit_impl.c to blink the RGB LED.
