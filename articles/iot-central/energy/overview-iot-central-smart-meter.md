# What is the Smart Meter Monitoring App?

## Overview 
The Smart Meter Monitoring App enables utilities and partner companies to monitor smart meters, such as their energy consumption and connection status in near real time. It can send notifications based on defined threshold criteria. It performs various command and control activities, such as disconnect meter and update software. The meter data can be set up to egress to other business applications and to develop custom solutions. There is no new coding and no additional cost required to deploy and use this application template.

Appâ€™s key functionalities: 

* Smart meter sample device model 
* Data ingestion and operational storage 
* Device command and control 
* Built-in visualization and dashboards
* Rules management and easy integration with other azure services
* Extensibility option for custom solution development

You can try the [Smart Meter Monitoring App free](tba) without an Azure Subscription, and any commitments.
