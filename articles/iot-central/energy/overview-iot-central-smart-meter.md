# What is Smart Meter Monitoring App?

## Overview 
The smart meter monitoring app enables utilities and partner companies to monitor smart meter, such as energy consumption and connection status, in near real time. It can send notifications based on defined threshold criteria. Finally, it performs various command and control activities, such as disconnect meter and update software. There is no new coding and no additional cost required to try this app, see tutorial section on deployment details. Also, the app allows users to egress the data to other business applications and to develop custom solutions.

The Appâ€™s key capabilities: 

* Smart meter device model sample 
* Data ingestion and operational store 
* Device command and control 
* Built-in visualization and dashboards
* Rule management and built-in integration with other azure services
* Extensibility option for custom solution development
