# What is Solar Panel Monitoring App?

## Overview 
The solar panel monitoring app enables utilities and partner companies to monitor solar panel, such as energy generation and connection status, in near real time. It also sends notifications based on defined threshold criteria. Finally, it performs various command and control activities, such as update firmware and other properties. There is no new coding and no additional cost required to try this app, see tutorial section on deployment details. Also, the app allows users to egress the data to other business applications and to develop custom solutions.

The Appâ€™s key capabilities: 

* Solar panel device model sample  
* Data ingestion and operational store 
* Device command and control 
* Built-in visualization and dashboards
* Rule management and built-in integration with other azure services
* Extensibility option for custom solution development

You can try [Solar Panel Monitoring App for free](tba) without an Azure Subscription, free of charge, and commitments.
