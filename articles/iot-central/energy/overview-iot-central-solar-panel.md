# What is the Solar Panel Monitoring App?

## Overview 
The Solar Panel Monitoring App enables utilities and partner companies to monitor solar panels, such as their energy generation and connection status in near real time. It can send notifications based on defined threshold criteria. It performs various command and control activities, such as update firmware and other properties. The solar panel data can be set up to egress to other business applications and to develop custom solutions. There is no new coding and no additional cost required to deploy and use this application template. 

Appâ€™s key functionalities: 

* Solar panel sample device model 
* Data ingestion and operational storage 
* Device command and control 
* Built-in visualization and dashboards
* Rules management and easy integration with other azure services
* Extensibility option for custom solution development

You can try the [Solar Panel Monitoring App for free](tba) without an Azure Subscription and any commitments.
