# Build energy solutions with IoT Central 

Learn about energy application templates and their capabilities. No new coding and no additional cost are required to deploy and use these applications. Partners can leverage these app templates to build energy solutions with IoT Central for their specific needs.


## What is smart meter monitoring application?
Smart meters are playing an important role in energy industry transformations. The smart meters not only enable automated billing, but also advanced metering use cases such as real-time readings and bi-directional communication. The smart meter app template enables utilities and partners to monitor smart meters status and data, define alarms and notifications. It provides sample commands, such as disconnect meter and update software. The meter data can be set up to egress to other business applications and to develop custom solutions. 

App’s key functionalities: 

* Meter sample device model 
* Meter info and live status 
* Energy, Power, voltages trends in real time
* Command and control samples  
* Built-in visualization and dashboards
* Extensibility option for custom solution development

You can try the [Smart Meter Monitoring App for free](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/build/new/smart-meter-monitoring) without an Azure Subscription, and any commitments.


After you deploy the app, you'll see the simulated meter data on the dashboard, as shown in the figure below. This template is a sample app that you can easily extend and customize for your specific use cases.

## What is solar panel monitoring application?
The Solar Panel Monitoring App enables utilities and partners to monitor solar panels, such as their energy generation and connection status in near real time. It can send notifications based on defined threshold criteria. It provides  sample commands, such as update firmware and other properties. The solar panel data can be set up to egress to other business applications and to develop custom solutions. 

App’s key functionalities: 

* Solar panel sample device model 
* Panel info and live status
* Renewable energy generation trends in real time
* Command and control samples
* Built-in visualization and dashboards
* Rules management and easy integration with other azure services
* Extensibility option for custom solution development

You can try the [Solar Panel Monitoring App for free](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/build/new/solar-panel-monitoring) without an Azure Subscription and any commitments.


After you deploy the app, you'll see the simulated solar panel data on the dashboard, as shown in the figure below. This template is a sample app that you can easily extend and customize for your specific use cases.
