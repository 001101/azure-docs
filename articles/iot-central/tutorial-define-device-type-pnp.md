# Tutorial: Define a new device type in your Azure IoT Central application (Plug and Play)

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-pnp-original](../../includes/iot-central-pnp-original-note.md)]

This tutorial shows you, as a builder, how to use a device definition to define a new type of device in your Microsoft Azure IoT Central application. A device definition defines the capabilities of your device. Capabilities include telemetry the device sends, device state, device properties, and the commands a device responds to.

<!-- A couple of options - use "connect" to generate code, or publish and create simulated -->
To enable you to test your application before you connect a real device, IoT Central generates a simulated device from the device definition when you create it.

In this tutorial, you create an **Environment Sensor** device definition. An environmental sensor device:

* Sends telemetry such as temperature.
* Reports device-specific properties such as brightness level.
* Responds to commands such as turn on and turn off.
* Reports generic device properties such as firmware version and serial number.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Create a new device definition
> * Import a device capability model.
> * Create cloud properties.
> * Define a visualization for the device telemetry.
> * Publish your device definition.
> * Create a simulated device from your device definition.
> * View your simulated device.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure IoT Central application. If you completed the [Create an Azure IoT Central application](quick-deploy-iot-central-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json) quickstart, you can reuse the application you created in the quickstart. Otherwise, complete the following steps to create an empty Azure IoT Central application:

1. Navigate to the Azure IoT Central [Application Manager](https://aka.ms/iotcentral) page.

1. If you have an Azure subscription, sign in with the credentials you use to access it, otherwise sign it using a Microsoft account:

    ![Enter your organization account](./media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/sign-in.png)

1. To start creating a new Azure IoT Central application, select **New Application**.

1. To create a new Azure IoT Central application that uses Plug and Play devices:

   * Choose **Trial**. You don't need an Azure subscription to create a trial application.

      For more information about directories and subscriptions, see the [create an application quickstart](quick-deploy-iot-central-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).

   * Choose **Plug and Play**.

   * Optionally you can choose a friendly application name, such as **Contoso Air Conditioners**. Azure IoT Central generates a unique URL prefix for you. You can change this URL prefix to something more memorable.

   * If you're creating a trial application, you need to provide your contact details.

   * Select **Create**.

     ![Azure IoT Central Create Application page](./media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/iotcentralcreate.png)

     For more information, see the [create an application quickstart](quick-deploy-iot-central-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).

<!-- Need to determine where to find this file online -->
You also need a local copy of the **EnvironmentalSensor.json** file that contains the device capability model. You can download it from here.

## Create a device definition

As a builder, you can create and edit device definitions in your application. After you publish a device definition, you can generate a simulated device or connect real devices that implement the definition. Simulated devices let you test the behavior of your application before you connect a real device.

To add a new device definition to your application, go to the **Device Definitions** page. To do so select the **Device Definitions** on the left navigation menu.

![Device Definitions page](./media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/devicedefinitions.png)

### Add a device capability model

The following steps show you how to import the capability model for an **Environmental Sensor** device. These devices send telemetry, such as temperature, to your application:

1. To add a new device definition, select **+ New** on the **Device Definitions** page.

1. Choose **Custom** from the list of device capability models.

1. Enter **Environmental Sensor** as the name of your device definition.

1. Choose **Import Capability Model** to create a new device capability model from a JSON file. Navigate to the folder where you saved the **EnvironmentalSensor.json** file on your local machine. Select the file **EnvironmentalSensor.json** and then select import. The environmental sensor capability model includes the **Environmental Sensor** and **Device Information** interfaces:

    ![Environmental sensor device capability model](./media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/newdevicecapabilitymodel.png)

    These interfaces define the capabilities of an **Environmental Sensor** device. Capabilities include the telemetry a device sends, the properties a device reports, and the commands a device responds to.

### Add cloud properties

A device definition can include cloud properties. Cloud properties only exist in the IoT Central application and are never sent to, or received from, a device.

1. Select **Cloud Properties** and then **+ Add Cloud Property**. Use the information in the following table to add a cloud property to your device definition.

    | Display Name      | Semantic Type | Schema |
    | ----------------- | ------------- | ------ |
    | Last Service Date | None          | Date   |
    | Customer name     | None          | String |

1. Select **Save** to save your changes:

    ![Cloud properties](media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/cloudproperties.png)

### Create views

You can create two types of view for an operator to use to interact with devices:

* Forms to view and edit device and cloud properties.
* Dashboards to visualize devices.

To create a dashboard to visualize the environmental sensor telemetry, select **Views** and then **Visualizing the Device**:

1. To add a chart that plots telemetry, select **Humidity** and **Temperature**, and then select **Combine**.

1. Select **Save** to save your dashboard definition:

    ![Dashboard definition](media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/dashboarddefinition.png)

## Publish device definition

Before you can create a simulated environmental sensor, or connect a real environmental sensor, you need to publish your device definition.

To publish a device definition:

1. Go to your device definition from the **Device Definitions** page.

1. Select **Publish**.

1. On the **Publish a Device Definition** page, choose **Publish**:

    ![Published model](media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/publishedmodel.png)

## Create a simulated device

You can create a simulated environmental sensor in your IoT Central application to see how it behaves before you connect a real device:

1. Go to the **Device Explorer** page and select the **Environmental Sensor** device definition.

1. Select **+ New**, and then on the **Create New Device** page, set **Simulated** to **On**, and select **Create**. Your simulated device appears in the list of **Environmental Sensor** devices:

    ![Device list](media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/devicelist.png)

### View the simulated device

Now you can view the dashboard you created for **Environmental Sensor** devices:

1. On the **Device Explorer** page, in the list of **Environmental Sensor** devices, select your simulated device.

1. On the **Dashboard** page, you can view the temperature and humidity telemetry and the properties.

    ![Device dashboard](media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/dashboard.png)

    If you want to edit the layout of the dashboard or add more tiles, go back to the views in **Device Definitions**.

1. On the Command page, you can call the device commands:

    ![Device commands](media/tutorial-define-device-type-pnp/commands.png)

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to:

* Create a new device definition
* Import a device capability model.
* Create cloud properties.
* Define a visualization for the device telemetry.
* Publish your device definition.
* Create a simulated device from your device definition.
* View your simulated device.

Now that you've created a device definition in your Azure IoT Central application, here is the suggested next step:
