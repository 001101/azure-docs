# How to use Tiles
You can use tiles to customize application dashboards, device dashboards, and device set dashboards. You can add multiple tiles to a dashboard and customize those tiles to show information relevant to your application. You can also resize tiles, and customize the layout on any dashboard. The below screenshot shows the application dashboard with different tiles.
