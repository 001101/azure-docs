# Building retail solutions with Azure IoT Central

Learn to build retail solutions with Azure IoT Central using application templates.


## What is connected logistics solution?
Global logistics spending is expected to reach $10.6trn in 2020, the largest GDP by industry. Transportation of goods is the majority (70%) of total logistics expenses. Shipping providers are under intense competitive pressure and constraints. 3PL providers are dealing with ever-decreasing time frames and rising compensation costs. Logistics is further strained by the risks posed by geopolitical, extreme climatic events, and crime. 

With the help of IoT sensors, we can collect & monitor ambient conditions i.e., Temperature, Humidity, Tilt, Shock, Light, and shipmentâ€™s location via GPS across multi-modal transformation i.e., Air, Water, Ground. Data gathered from sensors, devices, weather, & events can be integrated with cloud-based Business Intelligence systems. 
Connected logistics solution benefits are,
* Shipment transference with real-time tracing & tracking 
* Shipment integrity with real-time ambient conditions monitoring & cold chain
* Security from theft, loss, or damage of shipment
* Geo-Fencing, Route Optimization, Fleet management. Vehicle analytics
* Forecasting & predictability with the departure & arrivals 

Partners can leverage template to develop end to end Connected Logistics solutions & outlined benefits. This published template is focused on device connectivity, configuration & management of devices in IoT Central.

## What is smart inventory management solution?
"Inventory" is the stock of goods held by a retailer. Every retailer needs inventory to take care of supply and logistics lead time. Inventory is arguably the most valuable resource that every retailer needs to trade. In today's omnichannel world, inventory management is a critical requirement to ensure the right product is in the right place at the right time. Storing too much or too little inventory could hurt the retailer's business. Every year retailers are losing 8-10% of the revenue due to lack of inventory management capabilities.

IoT data enabled by Radio-frequency identification(RFID), Beacons & Camera is the opportunity to tackle this massive challenge in scale. The connectivity and real-time analytics inherent in IoT signals have become 
the game-changer for the retailer's inventory woes.  Data gathered from sensors, devices, weather, & events can be integrated with cloud-based Business Intelligence systems.  
Smart Inventory management benefits are, 
* Safeguards the organization against stock-outs and ensures the desired customer service level. 
* In-depth analysis & insights into inventory accuracy in near real time
* Decide on the right amount of inventory that suffices the customer orders

Partners can leverage template to develop end to end Smart inventory management solutions & outlined benefits.This published template is focused on device connectivity, configuration & management of RFID & Bluetooth low energy (BLE) readers in IoT Central.

## What is Digital Distribution Center solution?

As more manufacturers and retailers establish worldwide presences, their supply chains have branched out to become more complex than ever before. Distribution centers are becoming a primary challenge. Distribution Center/Warehouses are feeling the brunt of the pressure from e-commerce. Consumers now expect vast selections of products to be available, and for those goods to arrive within one to two days of purchase. Distribution centers must adapt to these trends while overcoming existing inefficiencies. 

Today, an overreliance on manual labor means picking and packing accounts for 55-65% of distribution center costs. While it is bad that manual labor slows down distribution center, rapidly fluctuating staffing needs (holiday staffing go up by 10X) make it even harder to meet shipping volumes. This seasonal fluctuation results in high turnover and the likelihood of errors and the need for costly rework increases as well.
Solutions based on IoT enabled cameras can deliver transformational benefits by enabling a digital feedback loop. This influx of data from across the distribution center leads to actionable insights that, in turn, result in better data.

Benefits are, 
* Cameras monitor goods as they arrive and move through the conveyor system
* Identify faulty goods and send them for repair
* Efficiently keep track of orders
* Reduce cost, improved productivity & Maximize utilization

Partners can leverage this application template to build Digital Distribution Center to gain actionable insights & above outlined benefits. The published template is focused on device connectivity configuration & management of camera and edge devices in IoT Central.
