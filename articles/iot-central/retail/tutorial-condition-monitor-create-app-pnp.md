# Tutorial: Create a condition monitoring retail application in Azure IoT Central

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-pnp-original](../../../includes/iot-central-pnp-original-note.md)]

This tutorial shows you, as a builder, how to create an Azure IoT Central application to monitor environmental conditions in a retail store. The application is a solution to the common business need to monitor and adapt to environmental conditions in a store or facility.

The tutorial shows how to connect two real devices--a Rigado gateway, and a RuuviTag environmental sensor--to your application. The Rigado C500 gateway serves as the communication hub in your condition monitoring application. It communicates with  sensors in your store and facilitates their connections to the cloud. The RuuviTag is an environmental sensor that provides  telemetry including temperature, humidity, and pressure. The tutorial includes directions for connecting RuuviTag or other sensors to the Rigado gateway. If you have another gateway and sensors, you can still follow the steps in this tutorial to build your application. If you have no devices you can still complete the tutorial, because it shows how to create simulated devices.

You develop the condition monitoring solution in three parts:

* Create the application and connect devices to monitor conditions
* Customize the dashboard to enable operators to monitor and manage devices
* Configure data export to enable store managers to run analytics and visualize insights

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use the Azure IoT Central **Store Analytics - Condition Monitoring** template to create a retail store application
> * Customize the application settings
> * Create and customize IoT device templates
> * Connect real and simulated devices to your application
> * Add rules and actions to monitor conditions

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial series, you need:
* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create one on the [Azure sign-up page](https://aka.ms/createazuresubscription).
* Access to a gateway device and environmental sensors (you can optionally use simulated devices as described in the tutorial)
* Device templates for the devices you use (templates are provided for the real devices used in the tutorial)

## Create an application
In this section you create a new Azure IoT Central application from a template. You'll use this application throughout the tutorial series to build a complete condition monitoring solution.

To create an application:

1. Navigate to the [Azure IoT Central application manager](https://aka.ms/iotcentral) website.

1. Sign in with the credentials you use to access your Azure subscription:

    ![Enter your organization account](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/sign-in.png)

1. To start creating a new Azure IoT Central application, select **New Application**.

To create a new Azure IoT Central condition monitoring application that uses preview features:  

1. Choose **Pay-As-You-Go**. A subscription is required to for this option.

1. Choose **Preview application**.

1. Optionally, choose a friendly **Application name** such as *Fabrikam, Inc.* By default Azure IoT Central generates a unique application name and URL prefix. You can change both values to something more memorable.

1. Select your *Directory, Azure subscription, and Region*. 

    For more information about directories and subscriptions, see the [create an application quickstart](../quick-deploy-iot-central-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).

1. Select **Create**.

    ![Azure IoT Central Create Application page](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/preview-application-template.png)

1. Use the **Select image** button to choose an image to upload as the **Application logo**.  Optionally, select a browser icon image that will appear on browser tabs.

    ![Azure IoT Central application logo](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/select-application-logo.png)

1. Select **Save**. After the upload completes, the application logo appears in the masthead.

## Create device templates
As a builder, you can create device templates that enable you and the application operators to configure and manage devices. You can create a template by building a custom one, by importing an existing template file, or by importing a template from the Azure IoT device catalog. After you create and customize a device template, you can use it to connect real devices to your application. Optionally, you can use a device template to generate simulated devices for testing.

To add a new device template to your application:

1. Select **Device Templates** in the left pane.

1. Select **+ New** to create a new device template.

    ![Azure IoT Central Create Device Template](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/new-device-template.png)

1. Select the **C500** Rigado gateway device template in the Azure IoT device catalog. Selecting the template adds it to your application. 

    ![Azure IoT Central Rigado C500 gateway device template](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/rigado-device-template.png)

    After you add the template, a summary view displays a list of device interfaces and capabilities.

1. Select **Device Templates** in the left pane.

1. Select **+ New** to create another new device template.

1. Select the **RuuviTag** sensor device template in the Azure IoT device catalog.

    ![Azure IoT Central RuuviTag sensor device template](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/ruuvitag-device-template.png)

## Customize device templates
You can customize the device templates in your application in three ways. First, you can customize the native built-in interfaces in your devices by changing the device capabilities. For example, with a temperature sensor, you can change details such as the display name of the temperature interface, the data type of the captured data, the units of measurement, and minimum and maximum operating ranges. Second, you can customize your device templates by adding cloud properties. Cloud properties aren't part of the built-in device capabilities. Cloud properties are custom data that your Azure IoT Central application creates, stores, and associates with your devices. An example of a cloud property could be a calculated value, or metadata such as a location that you want to associate with a set of devices. Third, you can customize device templates by building custom views.  Views provide a way for operators to visualize telemetry and metadata for your devices, such as device metrics and health.

In this section, you use the first two methods to customize the device template for your condition monitoring sensors. For information about creating views for your sensors, see the [Define a new device type](../tutorial-define-device-type-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json) tutorial. 

To customize the built-in interfaces of a device template in your application:

1. Select **Device Templates** again in the left pane. This page lists all device templates you added to your application.

1. Select the template for the RuuviTag sensors in the **Device Templates** page. If you used a different device template for the sensors, select it now.

1. Hide the left pane. The summary view of the template displays the device capabilities.

    ![Azure IoT Central RuuviTag device template summary view](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/ruuvitag-device-summary-view.png)

1. Select **Customize** in the device template menu. 

1. Scroll in the list of capabilities and find the `humidity` telemetry type. It's the row item with the editable **Display name** value of *humidity*.

In the following steps you customize the `humidity` telemetry type for the RuuviTag sensors. Optionally, customize some of the other interfaces.

For the `humidity` telemetry type, make the following changes:

1. Select the **Expand** control to expand the schema details for the row.

1. Update the **Display Name** value from *humidity* to a custom value such as *Relative humidity*.

1. Change the **Semantic Type** option from *None* to *Humidity*.  Optionally, set schema values for the humidity telemetry type in the expanded schema view. Schema settings allow you to create detailed validation requirements for the data that your sensors track. For example, you could set minimum and maximum operating range values for a given interface.

1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

    ![Azure IoT Central RuuviTag device template customization](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/ruuvitag-device-template-customize.png)

To add a cloud property to a device template in your application:

1. Select **Cloud Properties** in the secondary navigation.

1. Select **Add Cloud Property**. 

Specify the following values to create a custom property to store the location of each device:

1. Enter the value *Location* for the **Display Name**. This value is automatically copied to the **Name** field, which is a friendly name for the property. You can use the copied value or change it.

1. Select *String* in the **Schema** dropdown. This enables you to associate a location name string such as a geographical area, or an area within a facility, with each device. Optionally, you can set the **Semantic Type** of your property to *Location*, and this automatically sets the **Schema** to *Geopoint*. This enables you to associate GPS coordinates with a device. 

1. Set **Minimum Length** to *2*. 

1. Set **Trim Whitespace** to **On**.

1. Select **Save** to save your custom cloud property.

    ![Azure IoT Central RuuviTag device template customization](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/ruuvitag-device-template-cloud-property.png)

1. Select **Publish**. 

    Publishing a device template makes it visible to application operators. After you've published a template, use it to generate simulated devices for testing, or to connect real devices to your application. If you already have devices connected to your application, publishing a customized template pushes the changes to the devices.

## Add devices
After you have created and customized device templates, it's time to add devices to your application. This section shows how to use your device templates to connect a Rigado gateway and RuuviTag sensors to the application.  It also shows how to generate a simulated gateway and sensors.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have real devices to use, follow the steps to create simulated devices and complete the tutorial.

To connect a Rigado C500 gateway and RuuviTag sensors, follow the steps in [Connect a Rigado Cascade 500 to your Azure IoT Central application](../howto-connect-rigado-cascade-500-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central/retail/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).

To create a simulated Rigado C500 gateway: 

1. Select **Devices > C500** to enable you to create devices based on the Rigado gateway device template.

1. Select **+ New** to create a simulated gateway device.

   ![Azure IoT Central Create a Rigado C500 gateway](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/create-c500-gateway.png)

1. Enable the **Simulated** setting. 

1. Change the **Device ID** and **Display name** to a more meaningful name. For example, enter *gateway-c500-sim-001*. Changing the ID  is optional but helps to distinguish devices if you add multiple devices.

   ![Azure IoT Central Create a Rigado C500 gateway](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/create-c500-gateway-simulated.png)

1. Select **Create**. This generates a simulated instance of the gateway device in your Azure IoT Central application.

To create a simulated RuuviTag sensor:

1. Select the **RuuviTag** sensor template on the secondary navigation.

1. Select **+ New** to create a simulated sensor based on the template.

1. Enable the **Simulated** setting.

1. Change **Device ID** and **Display name** to *ruuvitag-sensor-sim-001*.  

1. Select **Create**.  

1. Repeat the preceding steps twice, to create two more simulated RuuviTag sensors. As you create the two sensors, change the **Device ID** and **Display name** values to *ruuvitag-sensor-sim-002* and *ruuvitag-sensor-sim-003*. The resulting device list for the RuuviTag device template shows the list of simulated sensors. 

   ![Azure IoT Central RuuviTag device list](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/ruuvitag-device-list.png)

1. Select one of the real or simulated RuuviTag devices in your application whose device status is `Provisioned`. The **Overview** tab provides a view of the sensor telemetry.

   ![Azure IoT Central RuuviTag device overview](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/ruuvitag-device-overview.png)

## Add rules and actions
As part of using sensors in your Azure IoT Central application to monitor conditions, you can create rules to run actions when certain conditions are met. A rule is associated with a device template and one or more devices, and contains conditions that must be met based on device telemetry or events. A rule also has one or more associated actions. The actions may include sending email notifications, or triggering a Microsoft Flow action or a webhook action to send data to other services. 

In this section you create a rule that checks the maximum relative humidity level based on the RuuviTag sensor telemetry. You add an action to the rule so that if the humidity exceeds the maximum, the application sends email. 

To create a rule: 

1. Expand the left pane.

1. Select **Rules**.

1. Select **+ New Rule**. 

1. Choose **Telemetry**. This type of rule is based on the telemetry generated by your sensors. 

   ![Azure IoT Central create a rule](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/rules-create.png)

1. Enter *Humidity level* as the name of the rule. 

1. Choose the RuuviTag device template in **Scopes**. The rule you define will apply to all sensors based on that template. Optionally, you could create a filter that would apply the rule only to a defined subset of the sensors, such as sensors that have a certain value for the custom `Location` property you created. 

1. Choose `Relative humidity` as the **Measurement**. This is the device capability that you customized in a previous step.

1. Choose `Greater than` as the **Operator**. 

1. Enter a typical upper range indoor humidity level for your environment as the **Value**. For example, enter *55*. You've set a condition for your rule that occurs when relative humidity in any RuuviTag real or simulated sensor exceeds this value. You may need to adjust the value up or down depending on the seasonal humidity range in your environment.  

   ![Azure IoT Central add rule conditions](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/rules-add-conditions.png)

To add an action to a rule:

1. Select **+ Actions**. 

1. Choose **Email**. 

1. Enter *Excess humidity notification* as the friendly **Display name** for the action. 

1. Enter the email address associated with your account in **To**. Any email address you use must be for a user who has been added to the application and who has signed in and out at least once. 

1. Optionally, enter a note to include in text of the email.

   ![Azure IoT Central add actions to rules](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/rules-add-action.png)

1. Select **Done** to complete the action.

1. Select **Save** to save and activate the new rule. 

    Within a few minutes, the specified email account should begin to receive emails. The application sends email each time a sensor indicates that the humidity level exceeded the value in your condition.
