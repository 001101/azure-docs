# Tutorial: Create a condition monitoring retail application in Azure IoT Central

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-pnp-original](../../../includes/iot-central-pnp-original-note.md)]

This tutorial shows you, as a builder, how to create an Azure IoT Central application to monitor environmental conditions in a retail store. This application is a solution to the common business need to monitor and adapt to environmental conditions in a store or facility.

You develop the solution in three parts: 
> * Create the application and connect devices to monitor conditions
> * Customize the dashboard to enable operators to monitor and manage devices
> * Configure data export to enable store managers to run analytics and visualize insights

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use the IoT Central **Store Analytics** template to create a condition monitoring application
> * Customize the application settings
> * Create and configure a set of IoT device templates
> * Add rules and actions to monitor conditions
> * Use the device templates to connect real and simulated sensors

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial series, you need:
* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create one on the [Azure sign-up page](https://aka.ms/createazuresubscription).
* Access to a gateway device and condition monitoring sensors (you can optionally use simulated devices as described in the tutorial)
* Device templates for the devices you use (templates are provided for the real devices used in the tutorial)

## Create an application
In this section you create a new Azure IoT Central application from a template. You will use this application throughout the tutorial series to build an end-to-end condition monitoring solution.

To create an application:

1. Navigate to the [Azure IoT Central application manager](https://aka.ms/iotcentral) website.

1. Sign in with the credentials you use to access your Azure subscription:

    ![Enter your organization account](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/sign-in.png)

1. To start creating a new Azure IoT Central application, select **New Application**.

To create a new Azure IoT Central condition monitoring application that uses preview features:  

1. Choose **Pay-As-You-Go**. A subscription is required to for this option.

1. Choose **Preview application**.

1. Optionally, choose a friendly **Application name** such as *Fabrikam, Inc.* By default Azure IoT Central generates a unique application name and URL prefix. You can change both values to something more memorable.

1. Select your *Directory, Azure subscription, and Region*. 

    For more information about directories and subscriptions, see the [create an application quickstart](quick-deploy-iot-central-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).

1. Select **Create**.

## Customize application settings
As a builder, you can change several settings to customize the user experience in your application.

To change the application theme:

1. Select **Settings** on the application toolbar.

    ![Azure IoT Central application settings](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/settings-icon.png)

2. Select a new **Theme**.

    ![Azure IoT Central application theme](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/settings-theme.png)

3. Select **Save**.

To change the application logo and browser icon:

1. Expand the side navigation menu, if not already expanded.

    ![Azure IoT Central application side navigation](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/dashboard-expand.png)

1. Select the **Administration** on the menu.

1. Select **Customize your application** on the submenu.

    ![Azure IoT Central customize application](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/customize-application.png)

1. Use the **Select image** button to choose an image to upload as the **Application logo**.  Optionally, select a browser icon image as well.

    ![Azure IoT Central application logo](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/select-application-logo.png)

1. Select **Save**. After the upload completes, the application logo appears in the application toolbar.

    ![Azure IoT Central save application settings](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/save-application-settings.png)

## Create device templates
As a builder, you can create device templates that enable you and the application operators to configure and manage devices. You can create a template by building a custom one, by importing an existing template file, or by importing a template from the Azure IoT device catalog. After you create and customize a device template, you can use it to connect real devices to your application. Optionally, you can use a device template to generate simulated devices for testing.

To add a new device template to your application:

1. Select **Device Templates** in the side navigation menu.

1. Select **+ New** to create a new device template.

    ![Azure IoT Central Create Device Template](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/new-device-template.png)

1. Select the **C500** Rigado gateway device template in the Azure IoT device catalog. Selecting the template adds it to your application. 

    ![Azure IoT Central Rigado C500 gateway device template](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/rigado-device-template.png)

    After you add the template, a summary view displays a list of device interfaces and capabilities.

1. Select **Device Templates** in the side navigation menu.

1. Select **+ New** to create another new device template.

1. Select the **RuuviTag** sensor device template in the Azure IoT device catalog.

    ![Azure IoT Central RuuviTag sensor device template](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/ruuvitag-device-template.png)

## Customize device templates
To customize a device template in your application:

1. Select **Device Templates** again in the side navigation menu. This page lists all device templates you added to your application.

1. Select the template for the RuuviTag sensors in the **Device Templates** page. Optionally, if you used a different device template, select it now.

1. Hide the side navigation menu. The summary view displays the list of device capabilities.

    ![Azure IoT Central RuuviTag device template summary view](./media/tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp/ruuvitag-device-summary-view.png)

1. Select **Customize** on the submenu.

1. 

For the `humidity` capability:

1. Change the **Display Name** value to `Store humidity`.

1. Select the `Humidity` option in **Semantic Type**.

## Next Steps
Tutorials should always have a Next steps H2 that points to the next logical tutorial in a series (one link only here), or, if there are no other tutorials, to some other cool thing the customer can do with the service. Use the blue box format for tutorials and note that you can shorten the H1 in the boxes if the original one doesnâ€™t fit.
