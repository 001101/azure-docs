<!---Recommended: Removal all the comments in this template before you sign-off or merge to master.--->

<!---overview articles are for new customers and explain the service from a technical point of view.
They are not intended to define benefits or value prop; that would be in marketing content.

# What is Water Quality Monitoring App 

<!---Required: 
For the H1 - that's the primary heading at the top of the article - use the format "What is <service>?"
You can also use this in the TOC if your service name doesn’t cause the phrase to wrap.
--->

<!---Required:
The introductory paragraph helps customers quickly determine whether an article is relevant.
Describe in customer-friendly terms what the service is and does, and why the customer should care. Keep it short for the intro.
You can go into more detail later in the article. Many services add artwork or videos below the introduction.
--->

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

<!---Screenshots and videos can add another way to show and tell the overview story. But don’t overdo them. Make sure that they offer value for the overview.
If users access your product/service via a web browser, the first screenshot should always include the full browser window in Chrome or Safari. This is to show users that the portal is browser-based - OS and browser agnostic.

Water Quality Monitoring app is an IoT Central app template to help you kickstart your IoT solution development to enable water utilities and cities to digitally monitor water quality. Traditional water quality monitoring relies on manual sampling techniques and field laboratory analysis which is time consuming and costly. With remote water quality sensing capabilities and real time monitoring water quality issues can be managed before citizens are impacted. Moreover, with advanced analytics, water and environmental agencies can act on early warnings on water quality deterioration and plan on water treatment to avoid impacting citizens health. 

The App template consist of:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample water quality monitor device templates
* Simulated water quality monitor devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Branding using white labeling

## <article body>
<!---
After the intro, you can develop your overview by discussing the features that answer the "Why should I care" question with a bit more depth.
Be sure to call out any basic requirements and dependencies, as well as limitations or overhead.
Don't catalog every feature, and some may only need to be mentioned as available, without any discussion.
--->
 

## <Top task>
<!---Suggested:
An effective way to structure you overview article is to create an H2 for the top customer tasks identified in milestone one of the [APEX content model](contribute-get-started-mvc.md) and describe how the product/service helps customers with that task.
Create a new H2 for each task you list.
--->

## Next steps

<!---Some context for the following links goes here--->

<!--- Required:
In Overview articles, provide at least one next step and no more than three.
Next steps in overview articles will often link to a quickstart.
Use regular links; do not use a blue box link. What you link to will depend on what is really a next step for the customer.
Do not use a "More info section" or a "Resources section" or a "See also section".
