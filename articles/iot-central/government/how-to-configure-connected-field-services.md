# How to connect your application with Dyanmics 365 Field Services 

As a builder, you can enable integration of your Azure IoT Central application to Dyanmics 365 Field Service. In IoT Central you can configure rules and actions which can create alerts in Field Service. Also, based on service activities in Connected Field Service, information can be sent back to Azure IoT Central. This is accomplished by using Microsoft Flow, which you can configure directly in IoT Central for automating workflows across applications and services.

The below end-to-end integration processes can be easily implemented based on a pure configuration experience:
* Azure IoT Central can send information about device anomalies to Connected Field Service (as an IoT Alert) for diagnosis.
* Connected Field Service can create cases or work orders triggered from device anomalies.
* Connected Field Service can schedule technicians for inspection to prevent the downtime incidents.
* Azure IoT Central device dashboard can be updated with relevant service and scheduling information.
