<!---Recommended: Removal all the comments in this template before you sign-off or merge to master.--->

<!---Tutorials are scenario-based procedures for the top customer tasks identified in milestone one of the [APEX content model](contribute-get-started-mvc.md).
You only use tutorials to show the single best procedure for completing an approved top 10 customer task.

# Tutorial: Create a water quality monitoring application in IoT Central
<!---Required:
Starts with "Tutorial: "
Make the first word following "Tutorial:" a verb.
--->

Introductory paragraph (Revisit)
<!---Required:
Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what the customer will learn, or do, or accomplish. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to do this?” question.
--->
This tutorial guides you to create an Azure IoT Central water quality monitoring application from the IoT Central Water Quality Monitoring application template. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use the Azure IoT Central **Water quality monitoring** template to create your water quality monitoring application
> * Explore sample operator dashboard 
> * Explore sample water quality monitor device template
> * Explore simulated devices
> * Customize pre-configured rules and add actions. 
> * Configure jobs.
> * Customize your application branding using whitelabeling. 


<!--- >> * Customize your application.
> * All tutorials include a list summarizing the steps to completion
> * Each of these bullet points align to a key H2
> * Use these green checkboxes in a tutorial
--->
<!---Required:
The outline of the tutorial should be included in the beginning and at the end of every tutorial. These will align to the **procedural** H2 headings for the activity. You do not need to include all H2 headings. Leave out the prerequisites, clean-up resources and next steps--->

<!--- Required, if a free trial account exists
Because tutorials are intended to help new customers use the product or service to complete a top task, include a link to a free trial before the first H2, if one exists. You can find listed examples in [Write tutorials](contribute-how-to-mvc-tutorial.md)
--->

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

## Prerequisites

<!---If you need them, make Prerequisites your first H2 in a tutorial. If there’s something a customer needs to take care of before they start (for example, creating a VM) it’s OK to link to that content before they begin.--->

To complete this tutorial you need:
-  An Azure subscription is recommended. You can optionally use a free 7-day trial. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create one on the [Azure sign-up page](https://aka.ms/createazuresubscription).


## Create Water Quality Monitoring app in IoT Central

<!-- Sign in to the [<service> portal](url). --->
<!---If you need to sign in to the portal to do the tutorial, this H2 and link are required.--->

In this section we will use the Azure IoT Central **Water quality monitoring template** to create your water quality monitoring application in IoT Central.


To create a new Azure IoT Central water quality monitoring application:  


1. Navigate to the [Azure IoT Central Home page](https://aka.ms/iotcentral) website.

* If you have an Azure subscription, sign in with the credentials you use to access it, otherwise sign in using a Microsoft account:

    ![Enter your organization account](media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/sign-in.png)

2. Click on **Build** from the left navigation menu and select the **Government** tab. The government page displays several government application templates.

    ![Build Govenment App templates](media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/iotcentral-government-tab-overview.PNG)


1. Select the **Water Quality Monitoring** application template. 
This template includes sample water quality monitoring device template, with simulated device, sample operator dashboard, pre-configured monitoring rules.    

2. Click **Create app** which will open **New application** creation form with the following fields:
* **Application name**. By default the application  uses *Water quality monitoring* followed by a unique ID string that IoT Central generates. Optionally, choose a friendly application name. You will be able to change this later too.
* **URL** – Optionally, you can choose to your desired URL. You will be ablet to change this later too. 
* If you have an Azure subscription, enter your *Directory, Azure subscription, and Region*. If you don't have a subscription, you can enable **7 day free trial** and complete the required contact information.  

    For more information about directories and subscriptions, see the [create an application quickstart](../core/quick-deploy-iot-central-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).

5. Click **Create** button at the bottom of the page. 

    ![Azure IoT Central Create Application page](media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/new-application-waterqualitymonitoring.PNG)


You now have created a water quality monitoring app using the Azure IoT Central **Water quality monitoring template**. IoT Central provisions the application with everything that it is included and you will land on the application dashboard which will look like the picture below. 

   ![Water Quality Monitoring application dasboard](media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/waterqualitymonitoring-dashboard.PNG)

Your newly created application comes with pre-configured:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample pre-defined water quality monitor device templates
* Simulated water quality monitor devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Sample Branding using white labeling 

It is your application and you can modify it anytime. Let’s explore the application and make some customizations.  


## Explore sample operator dashboard 


## Explore sample water quality monitor device template

## Explore devices

## Customize pre-configured rules and add actions. 

## Configure jobs.


## Customize your application 
As a builder, you can change several settings to customize the user experience in your application.

To change the application theme:

1. You can change the **Theme** by clicking the **Settings** on the masthead.

 <!--![Azure IoT Central application settings](./media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app-pnp/settings-icon.png) --> 

To change the application logo and browser icon:

1. Expand the left pane, if not already expanded.
2. Select **Administration > Customize your application**.
3. Use the **Change** button to choose an image to upload as the **Application logo**.  
4. Use the **Change** button to choose a **Browser icon** image that will appear on browser tabs.
5. You can also replace the default **Browser colors** by adding HTML hexadecimal color codes.

3. To update the application image:

* Select **Administration > Application settings**.

* Use the **Select image** button to choose an image to upload as the application image. This image appears on the application tile in the **My Apps** page in the Azure IoT Central application manager.


   

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete your application with the following steps:

1. Open the Administration tab from the left navigation menu of your IoT Central application. 
2. Select Application settings and click Delete button at the bottom of the page. 

    ![Delete application](media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/waterqualitymonitoring-application-settings-delete-app.PNG)        

<!---Required:
To avoid any costs associated with following the tutorial procedure, a Clean up resources (H2) should come just before Next steps (H2)
--->

## Next steps

Advance to the next article to learn how to create...
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]

<!--- Required:
Tutorials should always have a Next steps H2 that points to the next logical tutorial in a series, or, if there are no other tutorials, to some other cool thing the customer can do. A single link in the blue box format should direct the customer to the next article - and you can shorten the title in the boxes if the original one doesn’t fit.
Do not use a "More info section" or a "Resources section" or a "See also section". --->
