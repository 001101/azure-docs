# Configure role-based access controls

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-pnp-original](../../includes/iot-central-pnp-original-note.md)]

By default, you can assign users in your IoT Central application to one of three built-in *roles*:

- **Application Administrator**: Users in this role have access to all functionality in an Azure IoT Central application.
- **Application Builder**: Users in this role can do everything in an Azure IoT Central application except administer the application.
- **Application Operator**: Users in this role don't have access to **Design** mode or the **Application Builder** page. These users can't administer the application.

If your solution requires finer-grained access controls, you can create custom roles with custom sets of permissions. You can [add users to custom roles](./howto-manage-users-roles-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json#add-users) in the same way that you add users to the built-in roles.

## Custom role options

When you define a custom role, you choose the set of permissions that a user is granted if they're a member of the role. Some permissions are dependent on others. For example, if you add the **Update application dashboards** permission to a role, the **View application dashboards** permission is automatically added. The following tables summarize the available permissions you can use to create custom roles:

## Create a custom role

To create a custom role, navigate to the **Roles** page in the **Administration** section of your application. Then select **+ New role**, and add a name and description for your role. Select the permissions your role requires and then select **Save**.

You can [add users to your custom role](./howto-manage-users-roles-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json#add-users) in the same way that you add users to a built-in role.
