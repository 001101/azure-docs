# Cross-tenant management experience

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Delegated Resource Management is currently in limited public preview. The info in this topic may change before general availability.

This article describes the scenarios that you, as a service provider, can use with [Azure Delegated Resource Management](../concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md) to manage Azure resources for multiple customers from within your own tenant in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Delegated Resource Management can also be used within an enterprise which has multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants of its own to simplify cross-tenant administration.

Currently, the cross-tenant management experience supports the following scenarios with delegated customer resources:

[Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/):

- View alerts for delegated subscriptions and filter on up to 20 subscriptions
- View activity log details for delegated subscriptions
- Query data from remote customer workspaces

[Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/):

- Compliance snapshots showing details for assigned policies within delegated subscriptions
- Creating and editing policy definitions within a delegated subscription
- Assignment of customer-defined policy definitions within the delegated subscription
- Customers see policies authored by the service provider alongside any policies theyâ€™ve authored themselves

[Azure Resource Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/):

- Now includes the tenant ID in returned query results, allowing you to identify which tenant a subscription belongs to in the results 

[Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/):

- Ability to filter and see all info for delegated subscriptions
