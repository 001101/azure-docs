# What is Azure Service Provider Management Toolkit?

Azure Service Provider Management Toolkit provides comprehensive and robust management tooling, allowing service providers to deliver managed services for their customers with higher automation and efficiency at scale. This offering can also benefit enterprise IT organizations managing resources across multiple tenants.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some aspects of Azure Service Provider Management Toolkit are currently in limited public preview. The info in this topic may change before general availability (expected later this year).

## Benefits
Azure Service Provider Management Toolkit helps you to profitably and efficiently build and deliver managed services for your customers. The benefits include:

- **Management at scale**: Customer engagement and management experiences are easier and more scalable.
- **Greater visibility and enhanced security for customers**: Customers whose resources you’re managing will have greater visibility, enhanced security, and IP protection.
- **Comprehensive and unified platform tooling**: Our tooling experience addresses key service provider scenarios, including multiple licensing models.
- **Flexibility and consistency**: The new experiences work with existing tools, licensing models, and partner programs such as the [Cloud Solution Provider program (CSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/csp-overview). The Azure Service Provider Management Toolkit options you choose are ready to be integrated into your existing workflows.

## Features

Azure Service Provider Management Toolkit includes multiple ways to help streamline customer engagement and management:
- **Azure Delegated Resource Management**: Manage your customers’ Azure resources securely from within your own tenant. You can view cross-tenant info in the new My customers blade in the Azure portal. A corresponding Service providers blade lets your customers view and manage service provider access. For more info, see Azure Delegated Resource Management.
- **Managed Services offers in Azure Marketplace**: Offer your services to customers and have them automatically onboarded to Azure Delegated Resource Management. For more info, see [Managed services offers in Azure Marketplace](concepts/managed-services-offers.md).
- **Azure Resource Manager templates**: Perform management tasks more easily. For more info, see our Samples section.  
- **Azure managed applications**: Create cloud solutions that are easy for consumers to deploy and operate, using a resource group that you can manage in your tenant. For more info, see [Azure managed applications overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/managed-applications/overview).

> [!NOTE]
> The experiences described above are available in public clouds. Azure Marketplace Managed Services offers are not available for use in U.S. Government clouds.
