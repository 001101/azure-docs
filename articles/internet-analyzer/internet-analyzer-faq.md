## What scenarios is Internet Analyzer designed to address? 

Internet Analyzer is designed to give you networking performance insights based on your end users. To help you make the best performance decisions for your end users, Internet Analyzer allows you to evaluate and compare two endpoints for a given population of end users. While Internet Analyzer can answer a multitude of questions, some of the most common are: 
* What is the impact of migrating to the cloud? 
    * *Suggested Test: Custom (your current on-premises infrastructure) vs. Azure (any preconfigured endpoint)*
* What is the best cloud for your end-user population in each region? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom (other cloud service) vs. Azure (any preconfigured endpoint)*
* What is the value of putting my data at the edge vs. in a data center? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Azure vs. Azure Front Door, Azure vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*
* What is the performance benefit of Azure Front Door?
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom/ Azure/ CDN vs. Azure Front Door*
* What is the performance benefit of Azure CDN from Microsoft? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom/ Azure/ AFD vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*
* How does Azure CDN from Microsoft stack up? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom (other CDN endpoint) vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*

## Which tests can I run in preview? 

Each test you create in Internet Analyzer is composed of two endpointsâ€”Endpoint A and Endpoint B. Any of the following combinations can be run as tests:  
* Two preconfigured endpoints, 
* One custom and one preconfigured endpoint, or
