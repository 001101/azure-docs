## What scenarios is Internet Analyzer designed to address? 

Internet Analyzer is designed to give you networking performance insights based on your user population. To help make the best performance decisions for your users, Internet Analyzer compares the performance of two Internet using your distinct user population. While Internet Analyzer can answer a multitude of questions, some of the most common are: 
* What is the impact of migrating to the cloud? 
    * *Suggested Test: Custom (your current on-premises infrastructure) vs. Azure (any preconfigured endpoint)*

    *  *Suggested Test: Custom (other cloud service) vs. Azure (any preconfigured endpoint)*
* What is the value of putting my data at the edge vs. in a data center? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Azure vs. Azure Front Door, Azure vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*
* What is the performance benefit of Azure Front Door?
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom/ Azure/ CDN vs. Azure Front Door*
* What is the performance benefit of Azure CDN from Microsoft? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom/ Azure/ AFD vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*
* How does Azure CDN from Microsoft stack up? 
    *  *Suggested Test: Custom (other CDN endpoint) vs. Azure CDN from Microsoft*

## Which tests can I run in preview? 

Each test you create in Internet Analyzer is composed of two endpointsâ€”Endpoint A and Endpoint B. Any of the following combinations can be run as tests:
