# Embed the Internet Analyzer client

This article shows you how to embed the JavaScript client in your application. Installation of this client is necessary to run tests and receive scorecard analytics. You may embed the JavaScript client before or after test configuration but no tests will begin until the client step is complete. For more information on Internet Analyzer, see the [overview](internet-analyzer-overview.md).
