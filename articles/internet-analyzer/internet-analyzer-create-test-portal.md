# Create an Internet Analyzer test using Portal (Preview)

There are two ways to create an Internet Analyzer resource- using the Azure portal or using [CLI](internet-analyzer-cli.md). This section helps you create a new Azure Internet Analyzer resource using our portal experience. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This public preview is provided without a service level agreement and should not be used for production workloads. Certain features may not be supported, may have constrained capabilities, or may not be available in all Azure locations. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for details.
>

## Before you begin

The public preview is available to use globally; however, data storage is limited to *US West 2* during preview.

## Basics 

1. Get Internet Analyzer preview access by following the **How do I participate in the preview?** instructions from the [Azure Internet Analyzer FAQ](internet-analyzer-faq.md).
2. From the home page in the [Azure portal](https://preview.portal.azure.com), click **+ Create a resource**. Internet Analyzer is currently only available from the preview version of the Azure portal. 
3. On the **New** page, search for "Internet Analyzer" in the *Search the Marketplace* field. 
4. Click **Internet Analyzer (preview)**. Make sure the publisher is *Microsoft* and the category is *Networking*.
5. On the **Internet Analyzer (preview)** page, click **Create** to open the **Create an Internet Analyzer** page.
6. Specify the following configuration settings for your Internet Analyzer resource:

    * **Subscription:** The Azure subscription to host the new Internet Analyzer resource. ***Use the same Subscription ID used to request preview access.***
    * **Resource Group:** The Azure resource group that the new Internet Analyzer resource will be created in. If you donâ€™t have an existing resource group, you can create a new one.
    * **Name:** The name of the new Internet Analyzer resource profile. 
    * **Region:** The Azure public region that the resource will be created in. During preview, only *US West 2* is available.

7. When you have finished specifying the settings, click **Next: Configuration**. 

## Configuration

1. Give your test a name in the **Test Name** box.
2. Add a description for your test in the **Description** field. 
3. Click **Configure Endpoint** - a tab will appear from the right-hand side. Select the type of endpoint you'd like to configure- a single Azure region, multiple Azure regions, or a custom endpoint.

    > 
    ***Preconfigured endpoints: single and multiple Azure region combinations***
    * Select a region or set of regions from a [preconfigured list of Azure endpoints](internet-analyzer-faq.md).
    * Next, select the type of application or content delivery architecture you'd like to evaluate. 
        * Single Azure region: Site acceleration ([Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor/)), static content caching ([Azure CDN for Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cdn/)), or none. 
        * Multiple Azure regions: Site acceleration ([Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor/)), DNS steering ([Azure Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager/))  

    ***Custom endpoints***
    * Follow the instructions on the [Create Custom Endpoint](internet-analyzer-custom-endpoint.md) page. 
    * Paste the HTTPS URL location of the one-pixel image in the portal. 
    >

4. Click **Add** to add the endpoint to your test. 
5. Repeat steps 1-5 to configure your second endpoint. Endpoint B is always measured relative to Endpoint A - when configuring endpoints, consider which endpoint should be your test control. 
6. By default, tests will be set to **Enabled.** By leaving the Enabled field selected, your tests will start automatically once you embed the client. If you deselect **Enabled**, you will need to start your test from the *Configuration* tab.
7. Once you have created a test, click **Review + create.** You may add more tests at any point, but one test must be created for the unique JavaScript client to be generated. 

## Embed Client
To begin any test, the JavaScript client must be embedded in your Web application. After configuring at least one test, click **Review + create**, go to **Settings > Configuration**, and copy the JavaScript client. Specific instructions can be found on the [Embed Internet Analyzer Client](internet-analyzer-embed-client.md) page.  


## Next steps

* Read the [Internet Analyzer FAQ](internet-analyzer-faq.md)
* Learn more about embedding the [Internet Analyzer Client](internet-analyzer-embed-client.md) and creating a [custom endpoint](internet-analyzer-custom-endpoint.md).
