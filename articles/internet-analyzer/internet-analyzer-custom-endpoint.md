# Measure custom endpoints to evaluate in your Internet Analyzer tests 

This article shows you how to set up a custom endpoint to measure as part of your Internet Analyzer tests. Custom endpoints help you evaluate on-premises workloads, workloads running on other cloud providers, and custom Azure configurations. While you can compare two custom endpoints in one test, one endpoint must point to an Azure backend. For more information on Internet Analyzer, see the [Internet Analyzer Overview](internet-analyzer-overview.md).

## Before you begin

Make sure you set up an Internet Analyzer resource and selected the "Custom Endpoint" option. Internet Analyzer assumes your custom endpoint has access to the public internet. (Need help with the correct wording of this last part.) For more information, see [Create an Internet Analyzer Resource](internet-analyzer-create-test-portal.md).
