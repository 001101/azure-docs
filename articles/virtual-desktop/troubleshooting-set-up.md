# Windows Virtual Desktop Troubleshooting Guide

This article describes some common issues you may encounter when setting up a Windows Virtual Desktop tenant environment and provides information on how to resolve the issues.

## Overview

Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) is a multi-tenant service hosted by Microsoft that manages connections between RD clients and isolated Windows Virtual Desktop tenant environments. A tenant environment lets end users connect to published apps and desktops.

Each WVD tenant environment consists of one or more host pools. Each host pool consists of one or more identical session hosts. The session hosts are virtual machines (VMs) running different Windows operating systems. Each session host must have a WVD host agent installed and registered with the Windows Virtual Desktop service.

>[!NOTE] Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session is the recommended operating system to use for session host virtual machines (VMs). If you’re using Windows Server 2016 or 2012 R2 Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) for your session host VMs, you’ll also need to install or enable a protocol stack on the session host to support connections between the session host and the Windows Virtual Desktop service. This is known as “reverse-connect” and eliminates the need for inbound ports to be opened to the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant environment. The opposite of "reverse-connect" is “forward-connect” and requires an inbound 3389 port be opened to the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant environment.

Each host pool may have one or more app groups. An app group is a logical grouping of applications that are installed on the session hosts in the host pool. There are two types of app groups:

- Desktop
- RemoteApp

A desktop app group publishes the full desktop and provides access to all the apps installed on the session hosts in the host pool. A RemoteApp app group publishes one or more RemoteApps that display on the Remote Desktop client as the application window on the desktop of a local Remote Desktop client.

## Setup issues

This section covers potential issues during the initial setup of the WVD tenant and the related session host pool infrastructure.

### Acquiring the Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session image

To use the Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session image, select [Windows 10 Enterprise for Virtual Desktops Preview, Version 1809](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoftwindowsdesktop.windows-10?tab=PlansAndPrice) from the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/).

### Creating WVD tenant

During the private and public preview creation of the WVD, the tenant will be completed by the RDS/WVD team.

### Creating WVD session host VMs

> [!NOTE] Session host VMs can be created using multiple methods but RDS/WVD teams only support VM provisioning issues resulting from the usage of the Azure ARM template for creating new host pool. The Azure ARM template is available in [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### Issues executing “Windows Virtual Desktop – Provision a host pool”

**Error**: When using the link from GitHub, the message “Create a free account" appears.

![Screenshot for create a free account.](/media/be615904ace9832754f0669de28abd94.png.png)

**Cause 1:** There are no active subscriptions in the account being used to log into Azure or the account being used does not have permissions to view the subscriptions.

**Fix 1:** Sign in with an account that has been granted at a minimum contributor access to the subscription where session host VMs are going to be deployed.

**Cause 2:** The subscription being used is part of a CSP tenant.

**Fix 2:** Go to the GitHub location for **Create and provision new WVD host pool** and perform the following steps:

1. Right click on **Deploy to Azure** and select **Copy link address**.
2. Open **Notepad** and paste the link.
3. Before the \# character, insert the CSP end customer tenant name.
4. Open the new link in a browser and the Azure portal will load the template.

>   Example: https://portal.azure.com/\<CSP end customer tenant name\>
>   \#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FRDS-Templates%2Fmaster%2Fwvd-templates%2FCreate%20and%20provision%20WVD%20host%20pool%2FmainTemplate.json

### ARM template and DSC errors

Use the steps below to troubleshoot unsuccessful deployments of Azure ARM templates and DSC.

1. Review errors in the deployment using [View deployment operations with Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-operations).
2. If there are no errors in the deployment, review errors in the activity log using [View activity logs to audit actions on resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-audit).
3. Once the error is identified, use the error message and the resources in [Troubleshoot common Azure deployment errors with Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-common-deployment-errors) to address the issue.
4. Delete any resources created during the previous deployment and retry deploying the template again.

**Cause:** Part of the resource group name is used for certain resources being created by the template. Due to the name matching existing resources, the template may select an existing resource from a different group.

**Fix:** When running the ARM template to deploy session host VMs, make the first two characters unique for your subscription resource group name.

**Error:** DeploymentFailed – InvalidResourceReference

> **Example of raw error:** {"code":"DeploymentFailed","message":"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.","details":[{"code":"Conflict","message":"{\r\n \"status\":\"Failed\",\r\n \"error\": {\r\n \"code\": \"ResourceDeploymentFailure\",\r\n\"message\": \"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.\",\r\n \"details\": [\r\n {\r\n \"code\": \"DeploymentFailed\",\r\n\"message\": \"At least one resource deployment operation failed.

**Cause:** This error is due to having the NIC being created by the ARM template having the same name as another NIC already in the VNET.

**Fix:** Use different host prefix.

**Error:** DeploymentFailed – Error downloading.

> **Raw Error:** \\\"The DSC Extension failed to execute: Error downloading https://catalogartifact.azureedge.net/publicartifacts/rds.wvd-hostpool-3-preview-2dec7a4d-006c-4cc0-965a-02bbe438d6ff-private-preview-1/Artifacts/DSC/Configuration.zip after 29 attempts: The remote name could not be resolved: 'catalogartifact.azureedge.net'.\\nMore information about the failure can be found in the logs located under'C:\\\\WindowsAzure\\\\Logs\\\\Plugins\\\\Microsoft.Powershell.DSC\\\\2.77.0.0' on the VM.\\\"

**Cause:** This is due to either a static route, firewall rule, or NSG blocking download of the zip file tied to the ARM template.

**Fix:** Remove blocking static route, firewall rule, or NSG. Optionally, open the ARM template json file in a text editor, take the link to zip file, and download the resource to a location that is allowed.

## Session host VMs configuration

Use this section to troubleshoot issues when configuring session host VMs.

### VMs are not joined to the domain

Use the following information if you're having issues joining VMs to the domain.

- Join the VM manually using the process in [Join a Windows Server virtual machine to a managed domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/Active-directory-ds-admin-guide-join-windows-vm-portal) or via using the [domain join template](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/201-vm-domain-join-existing/).
- Try pinging the domain name from command line on VM.
- Review the list of domain join error messages in [Troubleshooting Domain Join Error Messages](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1935.troubleshooting-domain-join-error-messages.aspx).

**Error:** Incorrect credentials

**Cause:** There was a typo made when the credentials were entered in the ARM template interface fixes.

**Fix:**

1. Manually add the VMs to a domain.
2. Redeploy once credentials have been confirmed. Reference Get started with your WVD tenant document.
3. Use DSC to join VMs to a domain [BROKEN LINK](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/automagically/2015/08/05/domain-join-using-azure-automation-dsc-2/).

**Error:** Timeout waiting for user input.

**Cause:** The account used to complete the domain join may have multi-factor authentication (MFA).

**Fix:**

1. Temporarily remove MFA for the account.
2. Use a service account.

**Error:** Account used during provisioning not having permissions to complete the operation.

**Cause:** The account being used does not have permissions to join VMs to the domain due to compliance and regulations.

**Fix:**

1. Use an account that is a member of the Administrator group.
2. Grant the necessary permissions to the account being used.

**Error:** Domain name does not resolve

**Cause 1:** VMs are in a resource group that is not tied to the virtual network (VNET) where the domain is located.

**Fix 1:** Create VNET peering between the VNET where VMs were provisioned and the VNET where the domain controller (DC) is running. See [Create a virtual network peering - Resource Manager, different subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-peering-different-subscriptions).

**Cause 2:** When using AadService (AADS), DNS entries have not been set.

**Fix 2:** To set domain services, see [Enable Azure Active Directory Domain Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-getting-started-dns).

### Remote Desktop Infra Agent and Remote Desktop Agent Boot Loader are not installed

The recommended way to provision VMs is using the **Create and provision WVD host pool** ARM template. Installing the RD Infra Agent and RD Agent Boot Loader is part of the template functionality.

Use these steps to confirm the components are installed and to check for error messages.

1. Confirm that the two components are installed by checking in **Control Panel** \>**Programs** \>**Programs and Features**. If **Remote Desktop Infra Agent** and **Remote Desktop Agent Boot Loader** are not visible, this indicates they are not installed on the VM
2. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to **C:\\Windows\\Temp\\scriptlogs.log**. If the file is missing, this indicates that **DSC** that installed the two components was not able to run in the security context provided.
3. If the file **C:\\Windows\\Temp\\scriptlogs.log** is present, open it and check for error messages.

**Error:** Remote Desktop Infra Agent and Remote Desktop Agent Boot Loader are missing. C:\\Windows\\Temp\\scriptlogs.log is also missing.

**Cause 1:** Credentials provided during as input for the ARM template were incorrect or permissions were insufficient.

**Fix 1:** Manually add the missing components to the VMs by following the steps in your **Get started with your WVD tenant** document.

**Cause 2:** DSC was able to start and execute but failed to complete as it was not able to sign in to WVD infra and obtain needed information.

**Fix 2:** Step through the following list. - Make sure account does not have MFA. - Confirm tenant name is accurate and tenant exists in WVD. - Confirm account has at least RDS Contributor permissions.

**Error:** Authentication failed, Error in C:\\Windows\\Temp\\scriptlogs.log

**Cause:** DSC was able to execute but could not connect to WVD.

**Fix:** Check the following list:

- Manually register the VMs with the WVD service.
- Confirm account used for connecting to WVD has permissions on the tenant to create host pools.
- Confirm account does not have MFA.

### Remote Desktop (RD) Agent not registering with the WVD service

When the RD Agent is first installed on the session host VM (either manually or through ARM template/DSC), a registration token must be provided. The following section covers common troubleshooting steps applicable to the RD Agent.

**Error:** The status filed in Get-RdsSessionHost cmdlet shows status as Unavailable.

![Get-RdsSessionHost cmdlet shows status as Unavailable.](/media/23b8e5f525bb4e24494ab7f159fa6b62.png)

**Cause:** The agent is not able to update itself to a new version.

**Fix:** Manually update the agent with these steps:

1. Download a new version of the agent on the session host VM.
2. Launch Task Manager (TM) and in the Service Tab stop the RDAgentBootLoader service.
3. Run the installer for the new version of the RD Agent.
4. When prompted for the registration token, remove the entry INVALID_TOKEN and press next (a new token is not required).
5. Complete the installation Wizard.
6. Open TM and start the RDAgentBootLoader service.

**Error:** RD agent registry entry IsRegistered shows value of 0

**Cause:** Registration token has expired or has been generated with expiration value of 999999.

**Fix:** Follow these steps.

1. If there's already a registration token, remove it with Remove-RDSRegistrationInfo.
2. Generate new token with Rds-NewRegistrationInfo.
3. Confirm that the -ExpriationHours parameter is set to 72 (max value is 99999).

**Error:** RD agent is not reporting heartbeat when running Get-RdsSessionHost

**Cause 1:** RDAgentBootLoader service has been stopped.

**Fix 1:** Launch Task Manager (TM) and, if the Service Tab reports a stopped status for RDAgentBootLoader service, start the service.

**Cause 2:** Port 443 may be closed.

**Fix 2:** Open port 443 using the following steps.

1. Confirm port 443 is open by downloading the PSPing tool from [Sysinternal tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psping).
2. Install PSPing on the session host VM where the agent is running.
3. Open the command prompt as an administrator and issue the command below:

>   psping rdbroker.wvdselfhost.microsoft.com:443

Confirm that PSPing received information back from the RDBroker:

### Troubleshooting issues with the side-by-side stack

The side-by-side (SxS) stack gets installed with a Microsoft Installer (MSI) on Microsoft Widows Server 2016. For Microsoft Windows 10, SxS is enabled with **enablesxstackrs.ps1**.

There are three main ways SxS gets installed or enabled on session host pool VMs:

- With the **Create and provision new WVD hostpool** ARM template
- By being included and enabled on the master image
- Installed or enabled manually on each VM (or with extensions / PS)

If you're having issues with the the SxS stack, confirm the SxS stack is installed or enabled by issuing **qwinsta** command from **Command Prompt**. 

If SxS stack is installed or enabled, the output of **qwinsta** will list **rdp-sxs** in the output.

![SxS stack installed or enabled with qwinsta listed as rdp-sxs in the output.](/media/23b8e5f525bb4e24494ab7f159fa6b62.png)

Examine the registry entries listed below and confirm that their values match. If registry keys are missing or values are mismatched, follow guidance in **Getting started with your WVD tenant** on how to reinstall the SxS stack.

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal
    Server\\WinStations\\rds-sxs\\"fEnableWinstation":DWORD=1

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal
    Server\\ClusterSettings\\"SessionDirectoryListener":rdp-sxs

**Error:** O_REVERSE_CONNECT_STACK_FAILURE

![O_REVERSE_CONNECT_STACK_FAILURE error code.](/media/23b8e5f525bb4e24494ab7f159fa6b62.png)

**Cause:** The SxS stack is not installed on the session host VM.

**Fix:** RDP directly into the session host VM as local administrator. Complete steps in the Get started with your WVD tenant document for installing SxS stack.

**Error:** TBD

 **Fixes:** TBD

> Remove-ItemProperty 'HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server

> Client\\Default' -Name FeedURLs

> \#Remove RdClientRadc registry key

> Remove-Item 'HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\RdClientRadc' -Recurse

> \#Remove all files under %appdata%\\RdClientRadc

> Remove-Item C:\\Users\\pavithir\\AppData\\Roaming\\RdClientRadc\\\* -Recurse

Navigate to **%AppData%\\RdClientRadc\\** and delete all content.

Uninstall and reinstall Remote Desktop client for Windows 7 and Windows 10.

### Troubleshooting end user connectivity

In scenarios where users can obtain their feed and see the resource provided to them, there can sometimes be misconfigurations, availability, or performance issues that prevent users from accessing their remote resources. The user gets a messages like the one below:

![Remote Desktop Connection error message.](/media/eb76b666808bddb611448dfb621152ce.png)

![Can't connect to the gateway error message.](/media/a8fbb9910d4672147335550affe58481.png)

Below are general troubleshooting steps and common error codes.

1. Confirm user name and time when issue was experienced.
2. Open **PowerShell** and establish connection to the WVD tenant where the issue was reported.
3. Confirm connection to the correct tenant with **Get-RdsTenant.**
4. If needed set the tenant group context with **Set-RdsContext –TenantGroupt\<TenantGroup\>**.
5. Using **Get-RdsHostPool** and **Get-RdsSessionHost** cmdlets, confirm that troubleshooting is being done on the correct host pool.

Execute the command below to get a list of all failed activities of type connection for the specified time window:

> Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities -TenantName \<TenantName\> -username \<UPN\>\ -StartTime "11/21/2018 1:07:03 PM" -EndTime "11/21/2018 1:27:03 PM" -Outcome Failure - ActivityType Connection

Using the **ActivityId** from the previous cmdlet output, run the command below:

> (Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities -TenantName \$tenant -ActivityId \<ActivityId\>\ - Detailed).Errors

This will produce output of the type show below. Use **ErrorCodeSymbolic** and **ErrorMessage** to troubleshoot the root cause.

> ErrorSource       : \<Source\>

> ErrorOperation    : \<Operation\>

> ErrorCode         : \<Error code\>

> ErrorCodeSymbolic : \<Error code string\>

> ErrorMessage      : \<Error code message\>

> ErrorInternal     : \<Internal for the OS\>

> ReportedBy        : \<Reported by component\>

> Time              : \<Timestampt\>

**Error:** O_ADD_USER_TO_GROUP_FAILED / Failed to add user = ≤username≥ to group = Remote Desktop Users. Reason: Win32.ERROR_NO_SUCH_MEMBER

**Cause:** VM has not been joined to the domain where user object is.

**Fix:** Add VM to the correct domain. See [Join a Windows Server virtual machine to a managed domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-admin-guide-join-windows-vm-portal).

**Error:** Nslookup cannot resolve the name

**Cause:** Network issues or outages.

**Fix:** Contact network support

**Error:** ConnectionFailedClientProtocolError

**Cause:** VMs that user is attempting to connect to are not domain joined.

**Fix:** Join all VMs that are part of a host pool to the domain controller.

### User connects but nothing is displayed (no feed)

A User can start RD clients and is able to authenticate, however the user does not see any icons in their web discovery feed.

Confirm that the user reporting the issues has been assigned to application groups by using this command line:

> Get-RdsAppGroupUser \<tenantname\> \<hostpoolname\> \<appgroupname\>

Confirm that the user is logging in with the correct credentials.

If the web client is being used, confirm that there are no cached credentials issue.

## Management with PowerShell

This section covers common errors and issues reported when using PowerShell. For more information on RDS PowerShell, please see the **PowerShell Reference(WVD)** document.

### Add-RdsAppGroupUser

**Command:** Add-RdsAppGroupUser -TenantName <TenantName> -HostPoolName <HostPoolName> -AppGroupName 'Desktop Application Group' -UserPrincipalName <UserName>

**Error:** The specified UserPrincipalName is already assigned to a RemoteApp AppGroup in the specified HostPool.

**Cause:** The username used has been already assigned to an AppGroup of a different type. Users can’t be assigned to both a remote desktop and remote app group under the same session host pool.

**Fix:** If user needs both remote apps and remote desktop, create different host pools or grant user access to remote desktop only, as this will permit the use of any application on the session host VM.

**Command:** Add-RdsAppGroupUser -TenantName <TenantName> -HostPoolName <HostPoolName> -AppGroupName “Desktop Application Group” -UserPrincipalName <UserPrincipalName>

**Error:** The specified UserPrincipalName does not exist in the Azure AD associated with the RD tenant.

**Cause:** The user specified by the -UserPrincipalName cannot be found in the Azure AD tied to the WVD tenant.

**Fix:** Confirm the following:

- User has synched to Azure AD.

- User is not B2C or B2B.

- WVD tenant is tied to correct Azure AD.

### Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities

**Command:** Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities -ActivityId \<ActivityId\>

**Error:** Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities : User is not authorized to query the management service.

**Cause:** -TenantName switch is not specified. Issuing Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities without -TenantName \<TenantName\> will query the entire WVD service, which is not allowed.

**Fix:** Issue Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities with -TenantName \<TenantName\>.

**Command:** Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities -Deployment -username \<username\>

**Error:** Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities : User is not authorized to query the management service.

**Cause:** Using -Deployment switch.

**Fix:** -Deployment switch can be used by deployment administrators only. These are usually members of the RDS/WVD team. Replace -Deployment with -TenantName \<TenantName\>

### New-RdsRoleAssignment

New-RdsRoleAssignment cannot give permissions to a user that does not exist in the Azure AD.

**Error:** New-RdsRoleAssignment : User is not authorized to query the management service.

**Cause:** Account being used does not have RDS Owner permissions on the tenant.

**Fix:** A user with RDS Owner permission needs to execute the role assignment.

**Error:** New-RdsRoleAssignment : User is not authorized to query the management service.

**Cause:** Account being used does have RDS Owner permissions but is not part of Active Directory (AD) or does not have permission to query AD where the user is located.

**Fix:** User with AD permissions needs to execute the role assignment.
