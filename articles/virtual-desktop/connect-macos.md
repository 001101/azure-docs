# Connect with Microsoft Remote Desktop for macOS (Preview)

You can use the Microsoft Remote Desktop client to access published resources on Windows Virtual Desktop. To get started, go to the Mac App Store and install [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://aka.ms/rdmac).

After installing the client, get the list of resources available to you by subscribing to the feed provided by your admin.

1. Start the **Microsoft Remote Desktop** client on the MacOS device.
2. Switch to the **Feeds** tab.
3. Select **+**, then select **Remote Resources**.
4. Enter the URL provided by your admin.
5. Sign in with your user account.

>[!NOTE]
>If your admin has set up email discovery, the client will automatically look up your feed URL when you enter your email address.

You should now see a list of the feed's available resources. You can launch resources by selecting them on the Microsoft Remote Desktop client's main page.
