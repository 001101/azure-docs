# Connect to Microsoft Remote Desktop on macOS

The **Microsoft Remote Desktop 10** client found on the Mac App Store can be used to access resources published through Windows Virtual Desktop.

## Install the client

Install [Microsoft Remote Desktop 10](https://aka.ms/rdmac) from the Mac App Store.

## Subscribe to a feed

Get the list of resources available to you by subscribing to the feed provided by your admin.

1. Start the **Microsoft Remote Desktop 10** client on the MacOS device.
2. Switch to the **Feeds** tab.
3. Select **+**, then select **Remote Resources**.
4. Enter the URL provided by your admin.
5. Sign in with your user account.

>[!NOTE]
>If your admin has set up email discovery, the client will automatically look up your feed URL when you enter your email address.

After successfully authenticating, you should now see a list of resources available to you.

## Launch Windows Virtual Desktop resources

Once you are subscribed to a feed, you can launch resources by double-clicking them from the main page of the client.
