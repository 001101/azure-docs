# Connect from Windows 10 or Windows 7

> Applies to: Windows 7 and Windows 10.

A downloadable client is available that provides access to Windows Virtual Desktop Preview resources from devices running Windows 7 and Windows 10.

## Install the client

[Download](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2068602)Â and install the client to your local PC. This requires admin rights.

## Subscribe to a feed

Get the list of managed resources available to you from your local PC by subscribing to the feed provided by your admin.

To subscribe to a feed:

1. Start the client from the All Apps List, look for **Remote Desktop**.
2. Select either a work or school account on the main page. This will subscribe with the default feed URL.
   - You can also provide a different URL if needed with the **Use a URL instead** option.
3. Sign in with your user account.

> [!NOTE]
> If your admin has set up email discovery, the client will automatically look up your feed URL when you enter your email address.

After successfully authenticating, you should now see a list of resources available to you.

You can launch resources by one of two methods.

- Go to the client's main page and select a resource.
- Launch a resource as you normally would other apps from the Start Menu.
  - You can also search for the apps in the search bar.

## View the details of a feed

After subscribing to a feed, you can view additional information about the feed by accessing the details panel.

- From the main page of the client, click the ellipsis (**...**) to the right of the feed name.
- From the dropdown menu, select **Details**.
- The Details panel shows up on the right side of the client.

The Details panel contains useful information about the feed including the URL and username used for the feed, the content of the feed and information about the last update attempt.

## Unsubscribe from a feed
