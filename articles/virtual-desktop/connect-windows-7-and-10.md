# Connect from Windows 10 or Windows 7

> Applies to: Windows 7 and Windows 10.

A downloadable client is available that provides access to Windows Virtual Desktop Preview resources from devices running Windows 7 and Windows 10.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't use **RemoteApp and Desktop Connections (RADC)** or **Remote Desktop Connection (MSTSC)** to access Windows Virtual Desktop resources because Windows Virtual Desktop doesn't support either client.

## Install the client

[Download](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2068602)Â and install the client to your local PC. This requires admin rights.
