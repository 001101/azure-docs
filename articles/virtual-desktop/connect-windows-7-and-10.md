# Connect with Windows 7 and Windows 10 (Preview)

> Applies to: Windows 7 and Windows 10.

A downloadable client is available that provides access to Windows Virtual Desktop resources from devices running Windows 7 and Windows 10.

## Install the client

To install and deploy the client to your local PC:

1. [Download the client]() 
2. Run the MSI to install the client. This requires admin rights.

## Subscribe to a feed

Get the list of resources available to you from your local PC by subscribing to the feed provided by your admin.

To subscribe to a feed:

1. Start the client from the All Apps List, look for Remote Desktop.
2. Select either a work or school account on the main page. This will subscribe with the default feed URL.
  - You can also provide a different URL if needed with the **Use a URL instead** option.
3. Sign in with your user account.

> [!NOTE]
> If your admin has set up email discovery, the client will automatically look up your feed URL when you enter your email address.

After successfully authenticating, you should now see a list of resources available to you.

You can launch resources by one of two methods.

- Go to the client's main page and select a resource.
- Launch a resource as you normally would other apps from the Start Menu.
  -  You can also search for the apps in the search bar.

## Update the client

Unless stated otherwise, you can run the new MSI on the system to automatically update the client.
