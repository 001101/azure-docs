# Delegated access in Windows Virtual Desktop

The Windows Virtual Desktop delegated access model is based on the Azure RBAC model. You can grant users access by assigning them roles. A role assignment has three components: service principal, role definition, and scope. To learn more about specific role assignments and their components, see [the overview of Azure role-based access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles). Windows Virtual Desktop delegated access supports the following values for each element of the role assignment:

* Security principal
    * Users
    * Service principals
* Role definition
    * Built-in roles
* Scope
    * Tenant groups
    * Tenants
    * Host pools
    * App groups

## Built-in roles

Delegated acces in Windows Virtual Desktop has several built-in role definitions you can assign to users and service principals.

* An RDS Owner can manage everything, including access to resources.
* An RDS Contributor can manage everything except access to resources.
* An RDS Reader can view everything, but can't make any changes.
* An RDS Operator can view diagnostic activities.

## PowerShell cmdlets for role assignments

You can run the following cmdlets to create, view, and edit role asignments:

* **Get-RdsRoleAssignment** displays a list of role assignments.
* **New-RdsRoleAssignment** creates a new role assignment.
* **Set-RdsRoleAssignment** edits role assignments.

### Accepted parameters

You can modify the basic three cmdlets with the following parameters:

* *AadTenantId*: specifies the Azure Active Directory tenant ID from which the service principal is a member.
* *AppGroupName*: name of the Remote Desktop app group.
* *Diagnostics*: indicates the diagnostics scope. (Must be paired with either the *Infrastructure* or *Tenant* parameters.)
* *HostPoolName*: name of the Remote Desktop host pool.
* *Infrastructure*: indicates the infrastructure scope.
* *RoleDefinitionName*: name of the Remote Desktop Services role-based access control role that needs to be assigned to the user, group, or app; for example, Remote Desktop Services Owner, Remote Desktop Services Reader, and so on.
* *ServerPrincipleName*: name of the Azure Active Directory application.
* *SignInName*: the user's email address or user principal name.
* *TenantName*: name of the Remote Desktop tenant.
