# Create an FSLogix profile container in Windows Virtual Desktop

Windows Virtual Desktop is in [publicly preview](https://aka.ms/wvdpreview) and we wanted to share this step by step guide on how you can get FSLogix profile
containers on [Azure NetApp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/netapp/).

We are going to assume that you already have a set of VMs that are part of a Windows Virtual Desktop environment. Information on how to get that available at the official Windows Virtual Desktop documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/tenant-setup-azure-active-directory) or on the blog post in Tech Community [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/Getting-started-with-Windows-Virtual-Desktop/ba-p/391054).

The full documentation for configuring Azure NetApp Files are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-quickstart-set-up-account-create-volumes). In this article we have modified added steps particular to Windows Virtual Desktop.

This article will not cover best practices for securing access to the Azure NetApp Files share.

## Prerequisites 

-   Windows Virtual Desktop set up and configured
-   [Subscription is enabled for Azure NetApp Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register)

## Set up your Azure NetApp Files account

To get started, you need to set up an Azure NetApp Files account.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Make sure your account has contributor or administrator permissions.

2. Select the **Azure Cloud Shell** icon to open it.

   ![A screenshot of the Microsoft Azure toolbar with a red arrow pointing to the Azure Cloud Shell icon to the right of the search bar.](media/42d96dccad38b43b71e915c4300aa8ca.png)

3. Once Azure Cloud Shell is open, select **PowerShell**.

   ![A screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell welcome page. A red arrow is pointing to the option for opening Azure Cloud Shell with PowerShell.](media/b60565d35de4bcee50820769836d1ee8.png)

4. If this is your first time using Azure Cloud Shell, create a storage account in the same subscription you keep your Azure NetApp Files and Windows Virtual Desktop. <!--Ask for clarification for step 4-->

   ![The storage age with a red arrow pointing at the create storage button.](media/0058ca9f19a387c86319f51d5b4b9562.png)

5. Once Azure Cloud Shell loads, run the following two commands.

   ```shell
   az account set --subscription <subscriptionID>
   ```

   ```shell
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.NetApp --wait
   ```

   ![An image of an Azure Cloud Shell window running the two commands from step 5.](media/3be21e3963ae3ebd7ae051b3d9fa727a.png)

6. In the left side of the window, select **All services**. Enter **Azure NetApp Files** into the search box that appears at the top of the menu.

   ![A screenshot of a user entering "Azure NetApp Files" into the All services search box. The search results show the Azure NetApp Files resource.](media/6546f1ab07c5c0ef0e04b68b5f426472.png)

7. Select **Azure NetApp Files** in the search results, then select **Create**.

8. Select the **Add** button.
9. When the **New NetApp account** blade opens, enter the following values:

    - For **Name**, enter your NetApp account name.
    - For **Subscription**, select the subscription for the storage account you set up in step 4 from the drop-down menu.
    - For **Resource group**, either select an existing resource group from the drop-down menu or create a new one by selecting **Create new**.
    - For **Location**, select the region for your NetApp account from the drop-down menu. This region must be the same region as your session host VMs.

   >[!NOTE]
   >Azure NetApp Files currently doesn't support mounting of a volume across regions.

10. When you're finished, select **Create** to create your NetApp account.

   ![A screenshot of the new NetApp account menu showing the text boxes, drop-down menus, and Create button.](media/55dca1c987220ce419042bd1dfb88b56.png)

<!--Break here, turn 10 and the first part of 11 into new instructions-->

## Create a capacity pool

Next, create a new capacity pool: 

1. Go to the Azure NetApp Files menu and select your new account.
2. In your account menu, select **Capacity pools** under Storage service.
3. Select **Add pool**.
4. When the **New capacity pool** blade opens, enter the following values:

    - For **Name**, enter a name for the new capacity pool.
    - For **Service level**, select your desired value from the drop-down menu. We recommend **Premium** for most environments.
       >[!NOTE]
       >The Premium setting provides the minimum throughput available for a Premium Service level, which is 256 MBps. You may need to adjust this throughput for a production environment. Final throughput is based on the relationship described in [Throughput limits](..\azure-netapp-files\azure-netapp-files-service-levels.md).
    - For **Size (TiB)**, enter the capacity pool size that best fits your needs. The minimum size is 4 TiB.

5. When you're finished, select **OK**.

<!--Break here-->

## Join an Active Directory connection

After that, you need to join an Active Directory connection.

1. Select **Active Directory connections** in the menu on the left side of the page, then select the **Join** button to open the **Join Active Directory** page.

![A screenshot of the Join Active Directory connections menu.](media/03f68f9f13b185c0521d694b1e9e225e.png)

2. Enter the following values in the **Join Active Directory** page to join a connection:

    - For **Primary DNS**, enter the IP address of the DNS server in your environment that can resolve the domain name.
    - For **Domain**, enter your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
    - For **SMB Server (Computer Account) Prefix**, enter the string you want to append to the computer account name.
    - For **Username**, enter the name of the account with permissions to perform domain join.
    - For **Password**, enter the account's password.

  >[!NOTE]
  >It's best practice to confirm that the computer account you created in [Join an Active Directory connection](create-fslogix-profile-container.md#join-an-active-directory-connection) has appeared in your domain controller under **Computers.**
    ![A screenshot of the Active Directory Users and Computers window with a red arrow pointing at an example account that's appeared in the Computers folder after successful configuration.](media/53e367f2c72d5902bbfa82a1a7dd77ea.png)

<!--Break here-->

## Create a new volume

Next, you'll need to create a new volume.

1. Select **Volumes**, then select **Add volume**.

   ![A screenshot of the capacity pools menu with a red arrow pointing to Volumes under the storage service tab.](media/39f0c687e1cf89fb2448c0470e745418.png)

   ![A screenshot of the volumes menu with a red arrow pointing at the add volume button.](media/3aa9d3d9cd06f12c925e7d3d3dcd9c34.png)

2. When the **Create a volume** blade opens, enter the following values:

    - For **Volume name**, enter a name for the new volume.
    - For **Capacity pool**, select the capacity pool you just created from the drop-down menu.
    - For **Quota (GiB)**, enter the volume size appropriate for your environment.
    - For **Virtual network**, select an existing virtual network that has connectivity to the domain controller from the drop-down menu.
    - Under **Subnet**, select **Create new**. Keep in mind that this subnet will be delegated to Azure NetApp Files.

   ![A screenshot of the Azure NetApp files volume creation menu.](media/b1235bd64cfa165cabfa37a315fcb810.png)

3.  Select **Next: Protocol \>\>** to open the Protocol tab and configure your volume access parameters.

<!--break here-->

## Configure volume access parameters

After you create the volume, configure the volume access parameters.

1.  Select **SMB** as the protocol type.
2.  Under Configuration in the **Active Directory** drop-down menu, select the same directory that you originally connected in [Join an Active Directory connection](create-fslogix-profile-container.md#join-an-active-directory-connection). <!--make a link here--> Keep in mind that there's a limit of one Active Directory per subscription.
3.  In the **Share name** text box, enter the name of the share used by the session host pool and its users.

   ![A screenshot of the Protocol tab. The various parameter settings are labeled one through three based on their corresponding steps.](media/e36a9f45702b4047dbc3f167f7562313.png)

<!--Where should these pictures go to make their relationship with the instructions as clear as possible?-->

4.  Select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page. This opens the validation page. After your volume is validated successfully, select **Create**.

   ![A screenshot of the successful validation screen in the Review + create tab. A red arrow points to the Create button at the bottom left of the screen.](media/32c86e33f19308de496233240fd3c784.png)

5.  At this point, a the new volume will start to deploy. Once deployment is complete, you can use the Azure NetApp Files share.

   ![A screenshot of the deployment complete screen.](media/aeeb1c1d87f00537df93756ab74d181f.png)

6.  To see the mount path, select **Go to resource** and look for it in the Overview tab.

   ![A screenshot of the Overview screen with a red arrow pointing at the mount path.](media/3538527bfdd0d8a76b2ec3ce74f10890.png)

## Configure FSLogix on session host virtual machines (VMs)

This section is based on [Set up a user profile share for a host pool](create-host-pools-user-profile.md).

1. [Download the FSLogix agent .zip file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2084562) while you're still remoted in the session host VM.

2. Unzip the downloaded file.

3. In the file, go to **x64** > **Releases** and run **FSLogixAppsSetup.exe**. The installation menu will open.

   ![A screenshot of the Releases folder. The FSLogixAppSetup.exe file is highlighted.](media/fdb02247f8a528be7f7d63a550f8a10e.png)

4.  If you have a product key, enter it in the Product Key text box. If not, leave the box blank to start a 30 day trial.

5. Select the check box next to **I agree to the license terms and conditions**.

6. Select **Install**.

7. Navigate to **C:\\Program Files\\FSLogix\\Apps** to confirm the agent installed.

   ![A screenshot of the Apps folder with the installed FSLogix files inside of it.](media/32f561f6e923afc899019cc9657732f9.png)

8. From the Start menu, run **RegEdit** as administrator.

9. Navigate to **Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\software\\FSLogix**.

   ![A screenshot of the FSLogix folder in the Registry Editor](media/07dcb4497a96f1b8c111a88071ecf34d.png)

10. Create a key named **Profiles**.

   ![The user right-clicks the FSLogix folder in the Registry Editor file directory, then selects New in the drop-down menu, and then selects Key.](media/56af5129fe452d55356d6c1817c29f07.png)

11.  Create a value named **Enabled** with a **REG_DWORD** type set to a data value of **1**.

![A screenshot of the Profiles folder with the (Default) and Enabled values inside of it. The Enabled value is selected.](media/bf055352db16c62a97abf335c45861ee.png)

1.  Create a value named **VHDLocations** with a **Multi-String** type and set its data value to the URI for the Azure Files share.

   ![A screenshot of the Profiles folder with the VHDLocations value inside of it. The VHDLocations value is selected.](media/a420934cc18803242679cb8de863d767.png)

## Assign users to session host

1. Open **PowerShell ISE** as administrator and sign in to Windows Virtual Desktop.

2. Run the following cmdlets:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module Microsoft.RdInfra.RdPowershell
   # (Optional) Install-Module Microsoft.RdInfra.RdPowershell
   $brokerurl = "https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com"
   Add-RdsAccount -DeploymentUrl $brokerurl
   ```

3. When prompted for credentials, enter the credentials for the user with the Tenant Creator or RDS Owner/RDS Contributor roles on the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant.

4. Run the following cmdlets to assign a user to a Remote Desktop group:

   ```powershell
   $tenant = "<your-wvd-tenant>"
   $pool1 = "<wvd-pool>"
   $appgroup = "Desktop Application Group"
   $user1 = "<user-principal>"
   Add-RdsAppGroupUser $tenant $pool1 $appgroup $user1
   ```

## Verify profile user connectivity and access to Azure NetApp File share

1. Open your internet browser of choice.

2. Navigate to <https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/webclient/index.html>.

3. Sign in with the credentials of a user assigned to the Remote Desktop group.

4. Once you've established the user session, sign in to the Azure portal with an administrative account.

5. Open **Azure NetApp Files**, select your Azure NetApp Files account, and then select **Volumes**. Once the Volumes menu opens, select the corresponding volume.

<!--The corresponding volume for your user session?-->

   ![A screenshot of the NetApp account you set up earlier in the Azure portal with the Volumes button selected.](media/225c51fda15dbbd937616e1f1c302b1e.png)

   ![A screenshot of the Volumes screen in the Azure portal. A red arrow is pointing to the volume you created.](media/85f68f2d847e5238700214d5f33c976a.png)

6. Confirm that the FSLogix profile container is taking up space in the chart under Usage.

   ![A screenshot of the resource group's overview page. A red arrow is pointing to the current volume logical size indicator under usage, which says that the volume is using 0.3% of 268.79 MIB of space.](media/3a10923cb3b8ae93381c88daf1965a0f.png)

7. Connect directly to any VM part of the host pool using Remote Desktop and open the **File Explorer.** Then navigate to the **Mount path**
(in the following example, the mount path is \\\\anf-SMB-3863.gt1107.onmicrosoft.com\\anf-VOL).

   Inside that path there will be a folder named `<user SID>-<username>` (replace the bracketed values with the relevant values from your Azure NetApp Files account info). <!--Is this the right profile to use?-->

   ![A screenshot of the folder in the mount path.](media/9b7470e05e517e9bd60c8d6e4d0b08d0.png)

   Within this folder, there should be a profile VHD like the one in the following example.

   ![A screenshot of the contents of the folder in the mount path. Inside is a single VHD file named "Profile_ssbb."](media/a2462ee25312ddfd310b625673360c4e.png)
