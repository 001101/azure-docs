# Windows Virtual Desktop FAQ

This article answers frequently asked questions and explains best practices for Windows Virtual Desktop.

## What are the minimum admin permissions I need to manage objects?

If you want to create host pools and other objects, you must be assigned the Contributor role on the subscription or resource group you're working with.

You need to be assigned the User Access Admin role on an app group to publish app groups to users or user groups.

To restrict an admin to only manage user sessions, such as sending messages to users, signing out users, and so on, you can create custom roles. For example: 

```powershell
"actions": [
"Microsoft.Resources/deployments/operations/read",
"Microsoft.Resources/tags/read",
"Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read",
"Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/usersessions/read",
"Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/read",
"Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/write",
"Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/usersessions/write",
"Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools/sessionhosts/usersessions/delete"
],
"notActions": [],
"dataActions": [],
"notDataActions": []
}
```

## Does Windows Virtual Desktop support split Azure Active Directory models?

When a user is assigned to an app group, the service performs a simple Azure role-based access control (RBAC) role assignment. As a result, the user’s Azure Active Directory (AD) and the app group’s Azure AD need to be in the same location. All service objects, such as host pools, app groups, and workspaces, also need to be in the same Azure AD as the user.

You can create virtual machines (VMs) in a different Azure AD as long as the Active Directory is synced with the user's Azure AD in the same virtual network (VNET).

## What are location restrictions?

All service resources have a location associated with them. A host pool’s location determines which geography the service metadata for the host pool is stored in. An app group can't exist without a host pool. If you add apps to a RemoteApp app group, you'll also need a session host to determine the start menu apps. This also means that for any app group action, you'll also need a related data access on the host pool. To make sure data isn't being transferred between multiple locations, the app group's location should be the same as the host pool's.

Workspaces also need to be in the same location as their app groups. Whenever the workspace updates, the related app group updates along with it. Like with app groups, the service requires that all workspaces are associated with app groups created in the same location.

## Can RDP traffic be routed through ExpressRoute?

Windows Virtual Desktop doesn't currently include total separation of RDP traffic from public IPs. 

However, Windows Virtual does have the RDP ShortPath feature, which routes all RDP traffic over private addresses using ExpressRoute. This improves remote connection performance by using managed networks instead of public networks. However, signaling and telemetry data will still flow over public IPs.

## How do you expand an object's properties in PowerShell?

When you run a PowerShell cmdlet, you only see the resource name and location.

For example:

```powershell
Get-AzWvdHostPool -Name 0224hp -ResourceGroupName 0224rg

Location Name   Type
-------- ----   ----
westus   0224hp Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools
```

To see all of a resource's properties, add either `format-list` or `fl` to the end of the cmdlet.

For example:

```powershell
Get-AzWvdHostPool -Name 0224hp -ResourceGroupName 0224rg |fl
```

To see specific properties, add the specific property names after `format-list` or `fl`.

For example:

```powershell
Get-AzWvdHostPool -Name demohp -ResourceGroupName 0414rg |fl CustomRdpProperty

CustomRdpProperty : audiocapturemode:i:0;audiomode:i:0;drivestoredirect:s:;redirectclipboard:i:1;redirectcomports:i:0;redirectprinters:i:1;redirectsmartcards:i:1;screen modeid:i:2;
```

## Does Windows Virtual Desktop support guest users?

Windows Virtual Desktop doesn't support Azure AD guest user accounts. If guest users are licensed with ME3, WE3, or WIN VDA in their own company, but are in a different company's Azure AD as guest users, then the other company would have to manage the guest users' user objects in both Azure AD and Active Directory as if they were local accounts to their company.

## Why don't I see the client IP address in the WVDConnections table?

We don't currently have a way to collect the web client's IP address for the table, so that value isn't included.
