# Supported authentication methods

In this article, we'll give you a brief overview of what kinds of authentication you can use in Windows Virtual Desktop.

## Session host authentication

Windows Virtual Desktop supports both NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and Kerberos for authentication to the session host. However, in order to use Kerberos, the client needs to get Kerberos security tickets from a Key Distribution Center (KDC) service running on a domain controller. In order to get tickets, the client needs a direct line of sight to the domain controller. This is generally achieved by being on the corporate network or having a VPN connection to the corporate network.

Supported sign-in methods:
- Windows Desktop client
    - Username and password
    - Smartcard
    - Windows Hello
- Web client
    - Username and password
- Android
    - Username and password
- iOS
    - Username and password
- macOS
    - Username and password

>[!NOTE]
>Smartcard and Windows Hello can only use Kerberos to sign in.

## Unsupported methods

Windows Virtual Desktop currently doesn't support the following authentication methods:

- Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
- Single sign-on (SSO)

The only way to avoid being prompted for your password is to select the **Remember Me** check box on the prompt window, which will save your username and password to the credential manager.
