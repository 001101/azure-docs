# Hoster admin: delegated administration

## The why: problems, outcomes, and measures

>Guidance: Summarize relevant material from the scenario spec(s). Specify the customer, their problem or goal, and then specific outcomes the customer will achieve or how success would be measured. Avoid implementation details that may restrict solution choices or bias the measures!

Customers of current Remote Desktop Services (RDS) have complained about the lack of ability to delegate administrative capabilities on an RDS deployment. All administrators must be domain admins and therefore have full control over the RDS 2016 deployment, making it impossible to delegate access to specific resources within the RDS deployment. Windows Virtual Desktop will address this issue by providing a delegated administrative capability, similar to [Azure’s Role-based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles).

## This feature supports the following scenario(s)

The following scenarios are based on the [MultiTenantRDScenarioSpec](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/RD20/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=nSg2m%2bEIi2BZOAB5zfilRlXyhRZnJpvtSEAdae%2fzhTg%3d&docid=2_141c399e4dd314465b24bba4ad06a562c&rev=1), the [RD infra deployment functional spec](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/RD20/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=PFC3Bj7H7vuRvAk8kgbJfdtesGqxUxOWKyM%2bnfsP680%3d&docid=2_17077495986444c1cb3b6befdaf7fbf63&rev=1), and the [Tenant environment functional spec](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/RD20/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=CaNCB%2bThVhngdHHlXnMNAj%2b5Hca3xk3z%2fo9iHneVcjc%3d&docid=2_10084ffd2b4fb40169409b68d584c35b8&rev=1). Seven personas are used in these scenarios. (There is an equivalent set of personas for Enterprise customers, but the situation is simpler since all Enterprise users are typically in the same company. Consequently, this article will focus on hosting scenarios where user accounts are in multiple companies.) The personas are as follows:

* Hosting Services Provider’s (HSP’s) infra admin. Technical skill level: high.
* HSP’s operations engineer. Technical skill level: medium.
* Independent Software Vendor’s (ISV’s) admin for customers. Technical skill level: high.
* ISV’s admin for customer environments. Technical skill level: high.
* ISV’s operations engineer. Technical skill level: medium.
* End customer’s admin. Technical skill level: low.
* HSP service reseller. Technical skill level: low.

This functional specification assumes that the HSP’s primary infra admin has already deployed Windows Virtual Desktop. The scenarios in this section begin with the infra admin delegating access control to additional infra admins and one or more ISV admins who want to deploy an RD tenant environment for a new customer. ISV admins then delegate privileges to other ISV admins which can then delegate privileges to end customer admins.

The first section contains the primary “happy path” scenarios, where everything goes as expected for the primary target users and the admins. The later sections will cover failure scenarios.

## Happy path scenarios

This section focuses on scenarios involving an HSP providing a Windows Virtual Desktop deployment for an ISV that hosts applications for customers, because these scenarios represent the most general cases in which the various admin roles come from three different companies. There are single-tenant varations of these scenarios where all admin roles are within the same organization, but these scenarios won't be listed here because they're considered special cases.

### Scenario: HSP infra admin authorizes new HSP admin with same permissions (TP2)

An IT admin (in this example, Admin1@hsp1.net) within a hosting company has just deployed a new instance of Windows Virtual Desktop and is therefore automatically assigned full control over the Windows Virtual Desktop deployment. Now she wants to give another person (in this example, admin2@hsp1.net) within the company the same permissions as she has so that when she is unavailable, the other admin can perform the same tasks. She runs the PowerShell cmdlet to assign the other admin the same permissions for the Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure. She then sends the other admin the URL of the Windows Virtual Desktop management site and other instructions for the use of Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell to manage the Windows Virtual Desktop deployment and delegate admin privileges to other admins.

### Scenario: HSP primary infra admin authorizes new operations engineer from HSP company (TP2)

An admin (in this example, Admin2@hsp1.net) from an HSP is the infra admin for a Windows Virtual Desktop deployment. Now he wants to give an operations (ops) engineer (Ops1@hsp1.net) within the HSP company the ability to access the diagnostics information to track and trouble shoot problems in the infrastructure or any of the RD tenants. He runs the PowerShell cmdlet to assign the operations engineer permissions to access diagnostics for the Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure. He then sends the ops engineer the URL of the Windows Virtual Desktop management site and other instructions for the use of the Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell to read the diagnostics associated with Windows Virtual Desktop deployment and all RD tenants within the deployment.

### Scenario: HSP infra admin authorizes a new ISV admin from the ISV company (TP2)

An admin (in this example, Admin2@hsp1.net) from an HSP is the infra admin for a Windows Virtual Desktop deployment used by various ISVs to host Windows apps for users at other companies. A new ISV has signed up as a customer of the HSP’s Windows Virtual Desktop deployment and the ISV’s admin (in this example, AdminA@isv1.com) requests the ability to create new RD tenants for users at the ISV’s customers. Admin2@hsp1.net runs the PowerShell cmdlet to authorize AdminA@isv1.com access to the Windows Virtual Desktop with appropriate permissions to create and manage new RD tenants but with no privileges to read or modify the RD tenants managed by other ISVs. Admin2@hsp1.net then sends information to AdminA@isv1.com including instructions to consent to allow the HSP’s Windows Virtual Desktop app to read the ISV’s directory, the URL of the Windows Virtual Desktop management site, and ability to run Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmdlets.

### Scenario: ISV admin authorizes a fellow ISV admin control over existing RD tenants (TP2)

An IT admin (in this example, AdminA@isv1.com) within a ISV company has just created a new RD tenant within a Windows Virtual Desktop deployment and is therefore automatically assigned full control over the RD tenant. Now AdminA@isv1.com wants to give another admin (in this example, AdminB@isv1.com) within the ISV company the same permissions that she has so that the other admin can perform the same tasks whenever she is unavailable. AdminA@isv1.com runs the PowerShell cmdlet that assigns AdminB@isv1.com the same permissions for the RD tenant. She then sends the AdminB@isv1.com Windows Virtual Desktop management site URL and instructions for how to run Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmdlets to manage the RD tenant and delegate admin privileges to other admins.

### Scenario: ISVs admin authorizes an operations engineer from the sames company (TP2)

An IT admin (in this example, AdminB@isv1.com) at an ISV has created an RD tenant within an HSP’s Windows Virtual Desktop deployment for one of the ISV’s customers. AdminB@isv1.com now wants to delegate to an ops engineer (in this example, OpsA@isv1.com) within the ISV’s company, the ability to monitor and trouble shoot problems that may occur for this RD tenant’s users, but not other RD tenants. AdminB@isv1.com runs the PowerShell cmdlet to authorize OpsA@isv1.com with appropriate permissions to access diagnostics information for this RD tenant. AdminB@isv1.com then sends OpsA@isv1.com the Windows Virtual Desktop management site URL and instructions for how to run Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmdlets to read the diagnostics associated with this RD tenant.

### Scenario: ISV admin authorizes another ISV admin to create session host environments for end customer (TP2)

An IT admin (in this example, AdminB@isv1.com) at an ISV has created an RD tenant within an HSP’s Windows Virtual Desktop deployment for one of the ISV’s customers. The ISV admin now wants to delegate to another admin (in this example, AdminC@isv1.com) within the ISV’s company, the ability to create a host pool for that customer. AdminB@isv1.com runs the PowerShell cmdlet to authorize AdminC@isv1.com with appropriate permissions to create a new host pool for the customer but not be able to modify or delete other information about this RD tenant.

### Scenario: ISV customer environment admin gives an end customer company admin the ability to publish apps and assign app access to users from the customer’s company (TP2)

An ISV’s admin (in this example, AdminC@isv1.com) has created a host pool for a customer using an image that has the ISV’s apps and related apps installed on it. An admin (in this example, AdminX@customer1.org) at the customer has asked to have control over which apps are published to which end users. AdminC@isv1.com runs PowerShell to create and AppGroup for the customer and then runs PS to authorize AdminX@customer1.org to have the ability to publish or unpublish apps and control which users have access to the apps. AdminC@isv1.com sends AdminX@customer1.org information including instructions to consent to allow the HSP’s Windows Virtual Desktop app to read the customer’s directory, the URL for the Windows Virtual Desktop management site, and instructions for running the Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmdlets to create and manage app groups.

### Scenario: HSP infra admin gives an admin from a new reseller company the ability to publish apps and assign app access to users from a customer’s company (TP2)

An IT admin (in this example, Admin2@hsp1.net) from an HSP is responsible for managing a Windows Virtual Desktop deployment and for creating the RD tenant environments for resellers to use to host Windows desktops and apps for each reseller’s customers. A new reseller admin (in this example, Admin99@reseller1.com) signs up with the HSP, requests the creation of a new RD tenant for customer2.edu using one of the HSP’s OS images targeted at the education industry segment. Admin99@reseller1.com also requests the ability to create new RD app groups and assign access to users. Admin2@hsp1.net runs the PowerShell cmdlets to create an RD tenant and host pool, and AppGroups for publishing RemoteApps. Admin2@hsp1.net creates the tenant environment, including session hosts based on the requested OS image. Admin2@hsp1.net then runs a PowerShell cmdlet that authorizes Admin99@reseller1.com's access to the deployment with appropriate permissions to publish RemoteApps and assign users access to the AppGroup, but with no privileges to modify the tenant environment. Admin2@hsp1.net then sends information to Admin99@reseller1.com including the URL of the Windows Virtual Desktop management site, and instructions for how to run Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmdlets to create app groups and modify user assignments.

### Scenario: ISV admin authorizes an application to read RD tenant information to automatically scale the session hosts in the tenant environment (TP2)

An IT admin (in this example, AdminB@isv1.com) at an ISV has created an RD tenant within an HSP’s Windows Virtual Desktop deployment for one of the ISV’s customers. AdminB@isv1.com now wants to enable one of its scaling applications to read information about the current state of the RD tenant and host pools so that it can make decisions about scaling out or in the session hosts in the tenant’s pools. AdminB@isv1.com runs the PowerShell cmdlet to authorize the auto-scaling application (previously registered with Azure AD) to read information about the RD tenant, host pools, and session hosts in the RD tenant environment.

### Scenario: ISV admin attempts to get list of other ISVs and their customers that are hosted by the same HSP (TP2)

An IT admin (in this example, AdminB@isv1.com) at an ISV guesses that other ISVs are hosting within the same HSP’s Windows Virtual Desktop deployment and decides to see if a list can be generated of the other ISVs and their customers.

AdminB@isv1.com runs Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmdlets to list all RD tenants within the Windows Virtual Desktop deployment. However, the list only includes the RD tenants that AdminB@isv1.com has created or has been assigned read acess and does not list any RD tenants for other ISVs.

He suspects that another ISV is hosting an app for a customer. To check, AdminB@isv1.com runs Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmdlets to get information about a specific customer. Although the customer actually does exist in the infra, the error message that is returned is that the tenant does not exist. (If it returned that the tenant exists, that would reveal the information.)

After that, AdminB@isv1.com runs Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmldets to discover who is authorized to make changes to the Windows Virtual Desktop infra to gather intelligence on other ISVs hosting on the same HSP infra. However, the PowerShell cmdlet returns an error that says AdminB@isv1.com doesn’t have appropriate permissions to view or change the assignments on the RD infra deployment.

>[!NOTE]
>On-prem with ADFS auth scenarios will be identical.

## Detailed feature description

### Terminology

The following table defines some of the terminology used in this article. See Section 2.1 of [TenantEnvFunctionalSpec](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/RD20/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=CaNCB%2bThVhngdHHlXnMNAj%2b5Hca3xk3z%2fo9iHneVcjc%3d&docid=2_10084ffd2b4fb40169409b68d584c35b8&rev=1) for a definition of Deployment, Tenant, session host, host pool, app group, and so on.

|Term (short form)|Definition|
|---|---|
|HSP infra admin|A persona for an admin at an Hosted Service Provider (HSP) company that has full control over a Windows Virtual Desktop deployment. Full permissions include the ability to create, delete, modify, and read objects, as well as the ability to assign other users administrative access.|
|HSP primary infra admin|A persona for an admin at an HSP who initially creates a Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure deployment and is automatically given full control over the deployment.|
|ISV admin|A persona for an admin at an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) who has the ability to create RD tenants within a Windows Virtual Desktop deployment. Once an RD tenant is created, the ISV admin has full control over the RD tenant. However, the tenant admin cannot see RD tenant created by other ISVs.|
|ISV admin for customer environments|A persona for an admin at an ISV who is responsible for creating host pools for end customers.|
|End customer admin|A persona at an end customer company who is responsible for publishing apps and assigning user access for their fellow employees.|
|Reseller admin|A persona at a reseller company who is responsible for publishing apps and assigning user access for an end customer.|

### User interface overview

UI will be defined in a different admin UI spec for v2.

### Goals and requirements

The following table lists relevant requirements for your convenience. See section 3.1 of the [MultiTenantRDScenarioSpec](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/RD20/EXHpvIroy-pMsH4NbmazeYsBW4c7jwBtuAxZ_tw0vJrdYQ) for the complete requirement list.

|Number|Requirement|Pri|
|---|---|---|
|1|Hoster’s MT Infra runs in isolated RD MT Infra environment and manages connections to RDSH servers in multiple isolated customer environments. Environments may be in Azure or in partner hosted cloud. In Azure, partner’s Azure subscription parented to the partner’s AAD.|1|
|2|For Azure deployments, hosters use CSP to configure each customer environment in a subscription that is managed and billed to hosting partner but is parented to the customer’s AAD for authentication, including AAD DS.|1|
|5|Mechanism for partners to develop PowerShell scripts to poll state of session host VM pool and start/stop VMs to reduce their costs. (post v2 provide event driven mechanism and default scaling modules for Azure, Azure Stack, and Hyper-V fabric.)|1|
|9|MT Infra supports PowerShell interface for hoster admin to create, delete, configure, and manage tenant’s session host VM pools, collections, apps, users, connections, troubleshooting, telemetry. Reseller admin and tenant admin have subset of hoster admin PowerShell with limited scope.|1|
|40|IT admin at enterprise or SMB can utilize RD MT Infra for a single tenant deployment on-prem as single tenant deployment.|2|

* See section 2.3 in [TenantEnvFunctionalSpec](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/RD20/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=CaNCB%2bThVhngdHHlXnMNAj%2b5Hca3xk3z%2fo9iHneVcjc%3d&docid=2_10084ffd2b4fb40169409b68d584c35b8&rev=1) for a more complete list. Relevant requirements are copied here for your convenience.
  * Release v1 into market quickly to get feedback and start iterating.
  * Focus on solving a few major cost issues such as multi-tenancy and multiple app groups and desktops from a single pool.
  * Provide a secure, built-in delegated administration capability that supports the multi-tiered administration model typical in the RDS hosting channel. For example:
     * HSP: infra admin (deploys and has full control over the RDS infra, including assigning permissions to other admins)
     * HSP: ops engineer (reads diagnostics for the RDS infra and customers to troubleshoot problems)
     * ISV: Admin for customers (creates and has full control over ISV’s customers, but cannot access customers of other ISVs)
     * ISV: Admin for customer environments (creates and has full control over session host environments for the ISV’s customers)
     * ISV: ops engineer (accesses diagnostics to troubleshoot problems within the ISV’s customers)
     * Customer: customer admin (publishes applications and assigns access to users who are fellow employees)
     * Reseller:  admin for customer (publishes applications and assigns access to users who are employees of the reseller’s customers)
  * Use a delegated administration model that is already documented and that administrators are already be familiar with, e,g. the Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
  * Provide delegated admin capability at the level of explicitly created object instances that are not leaf nodes
    >[!NOTE]
    >Leaf nodes are excluded only as a simplification.)
  * Provide delegated admin at a method level in a few restricted cases (for example, specific operations that can be performed on specific objects)

### Non-goals (v1)

* Support of delegated admin at property level.
* Blocking of inheritance.

### Remote Desktop modern infrastructure roles

The Windows Virtual Desktop delegated administration model is based on Azure’s RBAC and uses the following three Azure RBAC built-in roles and definitions:

* RDS Contributor: can manage everything except access
* RDS Owner: can manage everything including access
* RDS Reader: can view everything but can't make changes

In addition, two Windows Virtual Desktop-specific built-in roles have been added:

* RDS Tenant Creator: can create RD Tenant objects assigned at the RD Infra Level, but user cannot view settings of the RD Infra container object and cannot view RD Tenant objects created by others
* RDS User: can access feed and the published apps and desktops within an AppGroup

As with the Azure RBAC model, these built-in roles have a set of capabilities that is defined by Microsoft and cannot be changed by the customer. In Windows Virtual Desktop vFuture, we may extend to allow additional custom roles to be created, depending on feedback from customers and partners.
PowerShell definitions to implement the scenarios covered in the specs are defined here.

>[!NOTE]
>Cmdlet Designer will be used to define the PowerShell cmdlets, parameters, and parameter sets. See the project named RemoteDesktop 2.0.

#### Object model

The following object containment model is provided to help understand the delegated admin model and associated PowerShell cmdlets. What is not shown in this diagram is that there is an additional object contained in each object called RoleAssignment. The RoleAssignment object specifies the admin role assignment for the object that contains it. The only exceptions to this are the SessionHost and UserSession objects which have no explicit role assignment and always inherit the same ownerships as the host pool.

**Figure 1** Object model

![Object model](media\Object-model.png)

#### Built-in Remote Desktop Services roles

The primary capabilities associated with each built-in Windows Virtual Desktop role are summarized in the following table.

|Role|Create|Modify|Read|Delete|Authorize|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|RDS Owner| X | X | X | X | X |
|RDS Contributor| X | X | X | X | |
|RDS Reader| | | X | | |
|RDS Tenant Creator| X (Tenants under deployment.) | | | | |

>[!NOTE]
>Following the Azure model capabilities for the built-in roles are fixed for each release but may change in a future release.

The following table maps roles to applicable objects and the PowerShell cmdlets (or equivalent REST APIs) that can be run under the Role-Object combination.

|Role|Applicable Objects|Permitted PowerShell and equivalent REST|

>[!NOTE]
>All implicitly created objects inherit. Leaf nodes always inherit to simplify.

#### RDS roles as defined by Azure RBAC Custom Role Definition syntax

The RDS roles can be defined in the format of a custom Azure RBAC role, as defined in [Custom roles in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-custom-roles), which is of the form:
Microsoft.<</span>ProviderName>/<</span>ChildResourceType>/<</span>action>

In this example:
* ProviderName = WVD
* ChildResourceType = RDS object class
* Action = PowerShell verb or equivalent REST method

#### Inheritance rules

When an object is explicitly created using PowerShell or REST, the creator’s account is automatically assigned the RDS Owner role on the object.

All explicitly created objects can have users and roles assigned and removed using PowerShell or REST.

Implicitly created objects such as SessionHost, UserSession, and Diagnostics cannot have roles assigned or removed directly, but always inherit the same privileges as the object that contains them. SessionHost and UserSession always inherit from the host pool. Diagnostics always inherits from the Infra object or Tenant object that contains it.

All objects inherit the roles assigned to the hierarchy of container objects above them.

To match Azure behavior, you should derive inheritance by traversing the tree above the object to determine inherited assignments, not by storing it on each object.

Inherited roles cannot be blocked at the inheriting object. Inherited roles can only be removed at the object that is the source of the inheritance.

A single user account may have two or more roles on a given RD object; such as 0 or 1 explicitly assigned to the RD object and 0-N inherited. A single user account can have the same role on one object if one is inherited and one is explicitly assigned.

### PowerShell cmdlet design

#### New-RdsRoleAssignment (TP2)

>Previous: none.

Modeled after [New-AzureRmRoleAssignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermroleassignment?view=azurermps-4.3.1) with the SignInName and ServicePrincipalName parameter sets. Scope is replaced with the RD parameters common to other Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell cmdlets, such as *TenantName*, *HostPoolName*, and *AppGroupName*. Three additional scopes added: Infrasturucture, Diagnostics/infra and Diagnostics/tenant. Simplified the parameter sets by dropping ObjectId as a subject of the assignment to support groups. (This will also be addressed in RS5 when we address groups for AppGroup user assignments.) Also simplified parameter sets by eliminating leaf objects from the scope.

SignInName parameter sets:

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -AppGroupName <string> -HostPoolName <string> -SignInName <string> -TenantName <string>
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -HostPoolName <string> -SignInName <string> -TenantName <string>
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -Diagnostics -Infrastructure -SignInName <string>
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -Infrastructure -SignInName <string>
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -SignInName <string>
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -Diagnostics -SignInName <string> -TenantName <string>
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -SignInName <string> -TenantName <string>
```

ServicePrincipalNme parameter sets:

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -AppGroupName <string> -HostPoolName <string> -ServicePrincipalName <string> -TenantName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -HostPoolName <string> -ServicePrincipalName <string> -TenantName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -Diagnostics -Infrastructure -ServicePrincipalName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -Infrastructure -ServicePrincipalName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -ServicePrincipalName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -ServicePrincipalName <string> -TenantName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
```

```PowerShell
New-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinition] <string> -Diagnostics -ServicePrincipalName <string> -TenantName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
```

Use the **New-RdsRoleAssignment** cmdlet to grant access. Access is granted by assigning the appropriate RDS role to a user or an application at the specified RD object scope. To grant access to the entire RD Deployment, assign a role at the Infra Deployment scope. To grant access to a specific RD Tenant within an RD Deployment, assign a role at the RD Tenant scope, and so on down the tree of RD Objects.

The subject of the assignment must be specified. To specify a user, use the *SignInName* parameter. To specify an application, use *ServicePrincipalName*.

The role that is being assigned must be specified using the *RoleDefinitionName* parameter.

The RD object scope at which access is being granted may be specified using RD object name parameters. With no RD object name parameters, it defaults to the InfraDeployment object that was set in the **Set-RdsContext** cmdlet. The scope of the assignment can be further narrowed by using the following parameters: *TenantName*, *HostPoolName*, and *AppGroup*.

Parameters:

* *AadTenantId*: specifies the AAD tenant ID from which the service principal is a member.
* *AppGroupName*: name of the RD AppGroup.
* *Diagnostics*: switch to indicate the diagnostics scope. (Must be paired with either the Infrastructure switch or the Tenant switch.)
* *HostPoolName*: name of the RD HostPool.
* *Infrastructure*: switch to indicate the infrastructure scope.
* *RoleDefinitionName*: name of the RDS RBAC role that needs to be assigned to the user, group, or app; for example, RDS Owner, RDS Reader, and so on.
* *ServerPrincipleName*: name of the Azure AD application.
* *SignInName*: the email address or the user principal name of the user.
* *TenantName*: name of the RD Tenant.

```PowerShell
Return: 
DeploymentName	: <String>
Infrastructure		: <Boolean switch>
TenantName		: <String>
HostPoolName		: <String>
AppGroupName	: <String>
Diagnostics		: <Boolean switch>
DisplayName        	: <String>      // this is the DisplayName of the User or ServicePrincipal
SignInName         	: <String> 
RdsRoleDefinitionName 	: <enum: RDS Reader, RDS Contributor, RDS Owner, RDS Tenant Creator, RDS User>
ObjectId           		: <Guid> 
ObjectType         	: <Enum: User, ServicePrincipal>
```

Console Output: same as the object above.

Error Conditions: for more information, see [Common error conditions and messages (TP2)](#common-error-conditions-and-messages-(TP2)).

The following table lists an error condition example.

|Error condition|Text|
|---|---|
|Adding a role assignment that already exists on the RD object|The role assignment already exists|

#### Get-RdsRoleAssignment (TP2)

>Previous: none.

Modeled after **Get-AzureRmRoleAssignment** with only the scope parameter set.

```PowerShell
Get-RdsRoleAssignment -AppGroupName <string> -HostPoolName <string> -TenantName <string>
```

```PowerShell
Get-RdsRoleAssignment -HostPoolName <string> -TenantName <string>
```

```PowerShell
Get-RdsRoleAssignment -Diagnostics -Infrastructure
```

```PowerShell
Get-RdsRoleAssignment -Infrastructure
```

```PowerShell
Get-RdsRoleAssignment [-Root]
```

```PowerShell
Get-RdsRoleAssignment -TenantName <string>
```

```PowerShell
Get-RdsRoleAssignment -Diagnostics -TenantName <string>
```

Use the **Get-RdsRoleAssignment** cmdlet to list role assignments that are effective within an RD object scope. This list can be filtered using parameters for principal and RD object scope.

The RD object scope may be specified. Without any parameters, this command defaults to the RD Deployment specified using the Set-RdsContext cmdlet and returns all the role assignments made under the RD Deployment. The scope can further limited with the following parameters: *TenantName*, *HostPoolName*, and *AppGroupName*. If RD objects are specified for the scope, then the cmdlet returns all of the inherited role assignments by traversing up the tree of container objects and below by traversing the tree of contained objects. Note that it doesn’t traverse sideways.

Parameters: same as **New-RdsRoleAssignment**

Return: list of role assignment objects as defined in **New-RdsRolesAssignment**.

Console Output: list of return objects with blank line in between each.

For example, a Windows Virtual Desktop Deployment (acmedeployment1) has two RD tenants (contosotenant1 and contosotenant2) and one RD host pool (hostpool1) under contosotenant1. The following users and roles are assigned:

* jane@acme.com is assigned to the RDS Owner role on root of acmedeployment1
* fred@acme.com is assigned to the RDS Contributor role on contosotenant1
* john@acme.com is assigned RDS Contributor on contosotenant2
* carmen@acme.com is assigned to the RDS Owner on hostpool1
* brigitta@acme.com is assigned RDS Read access to the contosotenant1 diagnostics
* AcmeScaling is a service principal assigned the RDS Contributor role on the root of acmedeployment1

Jane@acme.com runs the following cmdlet with the following results.

```PowerShell
Get-RdsRoleAssignment -TenantName “contosotenant1”
```

```PowerShell

```

```PowerShell
Remove-RdsRoleAssignment [-RoleDefinitionName] <string> -Diagnostics -ServicePrincipalName <string> -TenantName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
```

Use the **Remove-RdsRoleAssignment** cmdlet to revoke access to any principal at given scope and given role.

The object of the assignment, such the principal, must be specified. Use the *SignInName* parameter to identify a user or *ServicePrincipalName* to identify a ServicePrincipal.

The role that the principal is assigned to must be specified using the *RoleDefinitionName* parameter.

The scope of the assignment MAY be specified and if not specified, defaults to the RD Deployment scope. The scope of the assignment can be specified using one or more of the following parameters: *TenantName*, *HostPoolName*, and *AppGroupName*.

The parameters are the same as New-RdsRoleAssignment. Return should be either "success" or "failure." The console output will be blank or show an error.

For more information regarding error conditions, see [Common error conditions and messages (TP2)](#common-error-conditions-and-messages-(TP2)).

The following table lists an example error condition.

|Error condition|Text|
|---|---|
|The role assignment doesn’t exist.|The provided information does not map to a role assignment.|

#### Common error conditions and messages (TP2)

This section contains error conditions and messages that are common across many of the cmdlets.

The following table lists examples of error condition messages.

|Error condition|Text|
|---|---|
|Specified RD object instance does not exist in DB. For example,

|Specified service principal does not exist.|The specified ServicePrincipalName does not exist.|
|Specified user principal does not exist.|The specified SignInName does not exist.|
|The specified RoleDefinition does not exist.|The specified RoleDefinitionName does not exist.|

#### PowerShell error handling

There is also a set of common error conditions handled by PowerShell that are not duplicated here. For example:

* Cmdlet not found.
* Parameter not found.
* Parameter not available in parameter set.
* Parameter set conflict, such as two or more parameters are supplied that indicate different parameter sets.
* Value type mismatch.

## Open issues

>Guidance: mark open issues in the body of this document using the Open Issue style.

## Cut behavior

1. Support for groups using the ObjectId parameter.
2. Support for non-AAD users using the AdfsDomain parameter. (How do we handle Groups and service principles?)
3. Support for custom roles (future release if demand is high).

  The following parameter sets are for filtering the output of the Get-RdsRoleAssignment cmdlet by SignInName or ServicePrincipalName. This can be conisdered for future versions. Note that this can be achieved in v1 by piping the output into the Where-Object cmdlet. For example:

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -TenantName “mytenant” | Where-Object Where-Object {$_.SignInName -eq "clarkn@microsoft.com"
  ```

  **SignInName parameter sets (vFuture)**

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -SignInName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>]
  ```

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -SignInName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>] -TenantName <string>
  ```

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -SignInName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>] -TenantName <string> -HostPoolName <string>
  ```

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -SignInName <string> [-AadTenantId <string>] -TenantName <string> -HostPoolName <string> -AppGroupName <string>
  ```

  **ServicePrincipalName parameter sets (vFuture)**

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalName <String> [-AadTenantId <string>]
  ```

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalName <String> [-AadTenantId <string>] -TenantName <string>
  ```

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalName <String> [-AadTenantId <string>] -TenantName <string> -HostPoolName <string>
  ```

  ```PowerShell
  Get-RdsRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalName <String> [-AadTenantId <string>] -TenantName <string> -HostPoolName <string> -AppGroupName <string>
  ```

  VFuture: The subject of the assignment may be specified to filter the output. To specify a user, use SignInName or Azure AD ObjectId parameters. To specify a security group, use Azure AD ObjectId parameter. And to specify an Azure AD application, use ServicePrincipalName or ObjectId parameters.

4. RDS Creator (simplified to just RDS Tenant Creator).
5. RDS AppGroup Creator (Can be done by pre-creating an AppGroup, assigning user Owner of the AppGroup and then assigning user as Reader of HostPool).
6. Removed AadTenantId from these cmdlets to simplify. This means we only support UPNs and ServicePrincipalNames from home AAD tenants. If we decide in future to add AadTenantId back in to support non-home AAD tenants, then we’ll also need to add AadTenantId to the Set-RdsContext cmdlet.
  
  >[!NOTE]
  >Non-home UPNs means that admin1@hsp1.net.com UPN could be added to say the isv1.com AAD tenant is a guest.

# Appendix

## References

Azure RBAC testing was done using a combination of Azure Portal and PowerShell, AzureRm-RBAC.ps1.

Excerpt:

```PowerShell
# If clarkn@microsoft.com signs in to Azure Portal (owner on REFARCH_002) and
# assigns clark_nicholson@hotmail.com reader access to 2 of many resource groups in
# ...REFARCH_002 (under MSFT subscription). In particular: c15xrg1 and c17xrg1
# Then launch PS and run
Login-AzureRmAccount

# Then run the following:
Set-AzureRmContext -TenantId <Microsofttenantid>
Set-AzureRmContext -Subscrfiption "...REFARCH_002"
Get-AzureRmResourceGroup
# result is that clark_nicholson@hotmail.com only sees the two resource groups within the subscription
# that he has been assigned reader, i.e. c15xrg1 and c17xrg1.
# Not the many other RGs.
# if clark_nicholson@hotmail.com tries to access one of the other existing RGs,
Get-RdsAzureRmResourceGroup -Name "c16xrg1"
# Result: error msg that the RG doesn't exist
# Not that he doesn't have permissions to access it. (That would reveal that the RG exists.)
