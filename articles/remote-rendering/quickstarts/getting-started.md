# Getting started with Azure Remote Rendering

To get access to the Azure Remote Rendering service, you first need to [create an account](../azure/create-an-account.md).

Afterwards, follow [Quickstart: Render a model with Unity](quickstart-render-model.md).

## Learning resources

- To learn how to display remotely rendered content in a client application, see the [Unity sample project documentation](../how-tos/run-unity-sample-project.md).
- To get your own data into the service, have a look at [Quickstart: Convert a model for rendering](quickstart-convert-model.md). However, if you want to skip this step for now, we also provide a built-in model that can be used for testing.
- For building a deeper understanding of ARR we suggest following our Unity tutorial series, starting with [Tutorial: Setting up a Unity project from scratch](../tutorials/tutorial-1-unity-project-setup.md).

We provide the following Azure DevOps repository and NuGet feed.

- **Repository:** [arrClient](https://dev.azure.com/arrClient/arrClient/_git/arrClient) - contains sample code and documentation
- **NuGet feed:** [ArrPackages](https://dev.azure.com/arrClient/arrClient/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=ArrPackages) - contains the required Unity packages
