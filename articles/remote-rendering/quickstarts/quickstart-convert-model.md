# Quickstart: Convert a model for rendering

In the previous quickstart, you have learnt how to set up a Unity project to render a model with the Remote Rendering service. That quickstart used a built-in model to render. In this quickstart you will learn how to convert your own model, for example an .FBX file. Once converted, you can modify the code from the first quickstart to actually render it.

You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up Azure blob storage for input and outpu
> * Configure the conversion script with your credentials and storage information
> * Run the conversion and get back the URL of the converted model


## Overview
The renderer on the server consumes a model in a proprietary binary format, not a source model format (.FBX, .GLTF, ...) directly. To convert a model from source format to target format, we need to run the conversion service via API commands, which will be shown in this article.
The conversion API can consume models from Azure blob storage and will write the converted model back to a provided Azure blob storage container.
You will need to have:
- An Azure Subscription
- A Storage v2 account in your subscription
- A blob storage container for your input model
- A blob storage container for your output data

ARR supports the conversion of the following source formats: FBX, GLTF, and GLB files.

## Azure setup
For this guide, we will describe how to use Azure Remote Rendering with a free Azure account.
The same setup will apply if you are an existing user.

Go to  [https://azure.microsoft.com/get-started/](https://azure.microsoft.com/get-started/) or if you already have an account go to [https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home).
If you do not have an Azure account, then click on the free account option on the home page and follow those instructions.
Once completed, you will be forwarded to the portal page in the second link.

First, a Storage Account must be created so that will be the first task to complete.
From the Portal Home Page, there is a Storage accounts link on the left-hand side of the page.
Click this link.
This next screen will look slightly different. If you are already an active Azure client, however for this guide we will stick with the free account.
You will see a list of all Storage accounts under your subscription or none in this case.

Press the + Add button and you will be presented with the following screen to set up a new storage account.

![Azure Setup](./media/azure-setup1.png "Azure set-up")

  *	Create a new Resource Group from the link below the drop-down box and name this **ARR_Tutorial**
  *	For the Storage account name, enter **arrtutorialstorage**
  *	Select a location close to you
  *	Performance can be set to ‘Standard’
  *	Account kind can be set to ‘StorageV2 (general purpose v2)’
  *	Replication set to ‘Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)’
  *	Access tier set to ‘Hot’

Now add quick access blob containers – you will need one for input and one for output, so creating these two containers is the next step.

## Blob storage creation
Make sure you are within the arrtutorialstorage account that you created in the last step and note there is an option for Blob Services on the dashboard page.
Click this button, and you will be taken to the page that will allow us to set up our blob storage accounts.

Press the + Container button to create your first blob storage container.
Use the following settings when creating it:
  * Name = arrinput
  * Public access level = Private

Once the container has been created, repeat the process by clicking the + Container button, but this time use the following settings:
  * Name = arroutput
  * Public access level = Private

You should now have two blob storage containers:

![Blob Storage Setup](./media/blob-setup.png "Blob Storage Setup")

At this point, switch to using the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer tool – this provides information in one central location and makes it easier to configure Azure Remote Rendering.
Once you sign in using your Microsoft Azure account created in the previous steps, you will be presented with the following.
(You may need to expand a few items in the tree to see everything.)

![Azure Storage Explorer](./media/azure-explorer.png "Azure Storage Explorer")

As you can see from the image above, the tool displays all the information needed in setting up and linking our Azure Storage accounts to the Azure Remote Rendering tools, via the properties menu.
It also will allow you to generate sharable links, which will be needed later in the process.
For now, the next step is to configure a .json file so that the script can upload and convert your model.

## Ingestion.ps1 settings in arrconfig.json

Similar to the process of starting a rendering session, we provide a script to launch a conversion.
It is located in `Scripts` folder and is called `Ingestion.ps1`.

`Ingestion.ps1` uses `Scripts\arrconfig.json` to configure itself. First open `Scripts\arrconfig.json` in a text editor of your choice.
In addition to the values for spinning up the rendering session you also need to provide values for the following properties:

The `azureStorageSettings` section contains values used by the Ingestion.ps1 script. Fill it out if you want to upload a model to Azure Blob Storage and convert it by using our model conversion service.

* `azureStorageSettings.azureSubscriptionId` :  Open Azure Storage Explorer and click on the user icon on the left-hand side. Scroll down the list of subscriptions until you find the account used for this tutorial (in this case, the free trial account). **The SubscriptionID is located under the account name**
![Subscription ID](./media/subscription-id.png "Subscription ID")
* `azureStorageSettings.resourceGroup` :  **ARR_Tutorial** (The resource group created at the start).
* `azureStorageSettings.storageAccountName` : **arrtutorialstorage** (The Storage account created above).
* `azureStorageSettings.blobInputContainerName` : **arrinput** (The blob input container created above).
* `azureStorageSettings.blobOutputContainerName`: **arroutput** (The blob output container created above).
* `modelSettings.modelLocation` : the local file path of the model you want to convert with the conversion service. In this example, there is a robot.fbx file at the path `D:\\tmp\\robot.fbx`.
Make sure to properly escape "\\" in the path using "\\\\".

Here is an example `arrconfig.json` file for a `robot.fbx` at the path mentioned above. Change it to point to a local file you want to convert using the ARR conversion service.
```json
{
    "accountSettings": {
        "arrAccountId": "8*******-****-****-****-*********d7e",
        "arrAccountKey": "R***************************************l04=",
        "region": "westus2"
    },
    "renderingSessionSettings": {
        "vmSize": "small",
        "maxLeaseTime": "1:00:00"
    },
    "azureStorageSettings": {
        "azureSubscriptionId": "7*******-****-****-****-*********39b",
        "resourceGroup": "ARR_TUTORIAL",
        "storageAccountName": "arrtutorialstorage",
        "blobInputContainerName": "arrinput",
        "blobOutputContainerName": "arroutput"
    },
    "modelSettings": {
        "modelLocation": "D:\\tmp\\robot.fbx"
    }
}
```

## Running the asset conversion script
You are now ready to have the script upload your model, call the conversion REST API, and retrieve a link to the conversion model in your output container.

Open a powershell window. Make sure you have the [Azure Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/) package installed. To install the package, run the following command in powershell with admin rights:
```powershell
PS> Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber
```
Installation of the Azure Powershell is a one-time step.

## Make sure you are logged into your subscription
If you want to use the asset conversion service and upload files to Azure Blob Storage, you will need to log into your subscription.
In a powershell window (does not need admin rights):
```powershell
PS> Connect-AzAccount -Subscription "<your Azure subscription id>"
```

## Run Ingestion.ps1
Make sure you are within the `\ARR\arrClient\Scripts` directory, and run the script with `.\Ingestion.ps1`.

You should see something like this:
![Ingestion.ps1](./media/successful-ingestion.png "Ingestion.ps1")

The conversion script generates a Shared Access Signature (SAS) URI for the converted model for you to use.
Copy the SAS URI now. Note that this URI will be only valid for 24 h - after that you can create a SAS URI yourself by following these steps without reconverting the model.

Open Azure Storage Explorer and navigate to the arroutput blob storage container.
You will find the converted model ezArchive file in there.
Right click on this entry and select Get Shared Access Signature:

![Signature Access](./media/model-share.png "Signature Access")

Set the expiry date to a date you would like and press Create.
Copy the URL link that is generated. This URL is what you pass as a model name in the previous quickstart.
