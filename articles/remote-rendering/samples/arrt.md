# Azure Remote Rendering Asset Tool (ARRT)

![ARRT](./media/arrt.png "ARRT screenshot")

Azure Remote Rendering Asset Tool (ARRT) is an open-source desktop application developed in C++/Qt.

The application can be used to:

* upload a 3D model
* control the model conversion
* create and manage a remote rendering session
* load a 3D model
* preview the 3D model
* modify its materials

You can also use it as an open-source sample to learn how to implement a front end for the ARR C++ SDK, using the Azure Storage Client Library for managing the 3D model conversion.

## Source repository

You can find the source code and the documentation on the [GitHub ARRT repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-remote-rendering-asset-tool).
