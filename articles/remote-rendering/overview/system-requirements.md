# System requirements

This chapter lists the minimum system requirements to work with *Azure Remote Rendering* (ARR).

## Development PC

* Windows 10 version 1903 or higher.
* Up-to-date graphics drivers.
* Optional: H265 hardware video decoder, if you want to use local preview of remotely rendered content (for example in Unity or Unreal).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows update doesn't always deliver the very latest GPU drivers, check your GPU manufacturer's website for latest drivers:
>
> * [AMD drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
> * [Intel drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html)
> * [NVIDIA drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

The table below lists which GPUs support H265 hardware video decoding.

| GPU manufacturer | Supported models |
|-----------|:-----------|
| NVIDIA | Check the **NVDEC Support Matrix** [at the bottom of this page](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix). Your GPU needs a YES in the **H.265 4:2:0 8-bit** column. |
| AMD | GPUs with at least version 6 of AMD's [Unified Video Decoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Video_Decoder#UVD_6). |
| Intel | Skylake and newer CPUs |

## Devices

Azure Remote Rendering currently only supports **HoloLens 2** as a target device.

It's important to use the latest HEVC codec, as newer versions have significant improvements in latency. To check which version is installed on your device:

1. Start the **Microsoft Store**.
1. Click the **"..."** button in the top right.
1. Select **Downloads and Updates**.
1. Search the list for **HEVC Video Extensions from Device Manufacturer**.
1. Make sure the listed codec has at least version **1.0.21821.0**.
1. Click the **Get Updates** button and wait for it to install.

## Network

A stable, low-latency network connection is critical for a good user experience. Make sure that other devices in your network don't interfere too much while using Azure Remote Rendering. We tested remote rendering in various scenarios and made the following observations:

1. Using consumer-grade wifi and VDSL/cable connections is sufficient to run ARR.
1. Using the 5-GHz band for wifi often works better than 2.4 GHz.
1. Stay close to the wifi router, having line-of-sight is preferable.
1. Never use wifi repeaters or LAN-over-powerline forwarding.
1. Minimum bandwidth requirements are 50 Mbps downstream and 10 Mbps upstream.
1. For best hologram stability, we recommended 100 Mbps downstream and 40 Mbps upstream.

For troubleshooting network issues, check the performance statistics provided by the ARR API. In particular, *reused frames* indicate that a frame's data arrived too late to be picked up.

## Software

The following software must be installed:

* The latest version of **Visual Studio 2019** [(download)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)
* **Windows SDK 10.0.18362.0** [(download)](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
* **GIT** [(download)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* The **NuGet** command line tool and Credential Provider (see details below)
* Optional: To view the video stream from the server on a desktop PC, you need the **HEVC Video Extensions** [(Microsoft Store link)](https://www.microsoft.com/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7).

### How to install NuGet

1. Go to [https://dev.azure.com/arrClient/arrClient](https://dev.azure.com/arrClient/arrClient).
1. Click on **Artifacts**, change the dropdown to **ArrPackages**, and click on **Connect to feed**.

1. Click on **Nuget.exe**, then **Get the tools**
  ![Connect to Feed 2](./media/connect-to-feed-2.png)
1. From the link under *Step 1* download the latest NuGet.exe (under *Windows x86 Commandline*)
1. Copy NuGet.exe to some folder and add the location to your `PATH` environment variable.
1. The page linked under *Step 2* describes how to install the NuGet Credential Provider. The [manual installation](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider#manual-installation-on-windows) is straight forward.
1. Open a **new** command prompt (if you had to change your `PATH` environment variable you cannot reuse an existing one).
1. Add the "arrPackages" feed with the following NuGet command:
  
    ```plaintext
    NuGet.exe sources Add -Name "ArrPackages" -Source "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/arrClient/_packaging/ArrPackages/nuget/v3/index.json"
    ```

## Unity

For development with Unity, install

* Unity 2019.3 [(download)](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
* Install these components in Unity:
  * **UWP** - Universal Windows Platform Build Support
  * **IL2CPP** - Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)
