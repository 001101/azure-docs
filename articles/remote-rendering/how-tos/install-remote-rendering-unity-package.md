# Installing the Remote Rendering Unity package

We use a Unity package to encapsulate the Azure Remote Rendering integration into Unity.

## Manage the remote rendering packages in Unity

Unity packages are containers that can be managed via Unity's [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html).
This package contains the entire C# API as well as all plugin binaries required to run Azure Remote Rendering from within Unity.
Following Unity's naming scheme for packages, the package is called **com.microsoft.azure.remote_rendering**.

The package is not part of the [arrClient](https://dev.azure.com/arrClient/arrClient/_git/arrClient) repository, and currently it is not available from Unity's internal package registry. For now, it has to be obtained and added to projects manually.

Ensure you have the [NuGet command-line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/tools/nuget-exe-cli-reference) and [authentication to access Azure DevOps feeds](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/artifacts/nuget/nuget-exe?view=azure-devops). 
Then call the following command to pull the latest version of the package into the current directory:

* `nuget install com.microsoft.azure.remote_rendering`

Adding `-ExcludeVersion` creates a folder with no version extension, which is what is expected by the sample project.

To add the package to a Unity project, using the 'Add package from disk...' option. For further instructions on its usage, follow the guide to [create a new Unity project](../quickstarts/create-new-unity-project.md).

[flborn], Is the following chapter still valid?

## ScriptableRenderPipeline

To maximize performance and integrate Azure Remote Rendering seamlessly with Unity, changes needed to be made on Unity's side that are not publicly available yet.
In the meantime, we have created a modified version of Unity's scriptable render pipeline that gives the same benefits if used.
As with the remote rendering package, this needs to be obtained and added manually.

Call the following command to pull the latest version of the package into the current directory:

* `nuget install ScriptableRenderPipeline -ExcludeVersion`

As above, add the package to a Unity project using the 'Add package from disk...' option.
