# Configuring the model conversion

This chapter documents the user-facing options in the configuration file for the model conversion.

## Settings file

If a file called `ConversionSettings.json` is found in the input container beside the input model, then it is used to provide additional configuration for the model conversion process.

The contents of the file should satisfy the following json schema:

```json
{
    "$schema" : "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
    "description" : "ARR ConversionSettings Schema",
    "type" : "object",
    "properties" :
    {
        "scaling" : { "type" : "number", "exclusiveMinimum" : 0, "default" : 1.0 },
        "recenterToOrigin" : { "type" : "boolean", "default" : false },
        "opaqueMaterialDefaultSidedness" : { "type" : "string", "enum" : [ "SingleSided", "DoubleSided" ], "default" : "DoubleSided" },
        "material-override" : { "type" : "string", "default" : "" },
        "gammaToLinearMaterial" : { "type" : "boolean", "default" : false },
        "gammaToLinearVertex" : { "type" : "boolean", "default" : false },
        "sceneGraphMode": { "type" : "string", "enum" : [ "none", "static", "dynamic" ], "default" : "dynamic" },
        "generateCollisionMesh" : { "type" : "boolean", "default" : true },
        "unlitMaterials" : { "type" : "boolean", "default" : false },
        "axis" : {
            "type" : "array",
            "items" : {
                "type" : "string",
                "enum" : ["default", "+x", "-x", "+y", "-y", "+z", "-z"]
            },
            "minItems": 3,
            "maxItems": 3
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties" : false
}
```

An example `ConversionSettings.json` file might be:

```json
{
    "scaling" : 0.01,
    "recenterToOrigin" : true,
    "material-override" : "box_materials_override.json"
}
```

### Geometry parameters

* `scaling` - This parameter scales a model.
It can be used to grow or shrink a model, for example to display a building model on a table top.
Since the rendering engine expects lengths to be specified in meters, another important use of this parameter arises when a model is defined in different units.
For example, if a model is defined in centimeters, then applying a scale of 0.01 should render the model at the correct size.

* `recenterToOrigin` - States that a model should be converted so that its bounding box is centered at the origin.
Centering is important if the source model is displaced far from the origin, since in that case floating point precision issues may cause rendering artifacts.

* `opaqueMaterialDefaultSidedness` - The rendering engine assumes that opaque materials are double-sided.
If that is not the intended behavior, this parameter should be set to "SingleSided".

### Material overrides

* `material-override` - This parameter allows the processing of materials to be [customized during conversion](override-materials.md).

### Color space parameters

The rendering engine expects color values to be in linear space.
If a model is defined using gamma space, then these options should be set to true.

* `gammaToLinearMaterial` - Convert material colors from gamma space to linear space
* `gammaToLinearVertex` - Convert vertex colors from gamma space to linear space

> [!NOTE]
> If the input file is an fbx, these settings are true by default. Otherwise they are false by default.

### Scene parameters

* `sceneGraphMode` - Defines the mode that the scene graph is converted to and whether the scene graph can be accessed via the API. There are three distinct modes:
  * `dynamic` (default) : All objects in the graph are exposed in the API and can be transformed independently
  * `static` : All objects in the graph are exposed in the API but cannot be transformed independently.
  * `none` : The full scene graph is collapsed into one object

Naturally, each of the mode comes with specific runtime performance cost. The `dynamic` case implies significant runtime performance overhead, esp. for large amounts of scene graph objects. This mode should only be used when moving parts individually is mandatory for the application, for example for an 'explosion view' animation. This mode has a high baseline performance overhead, even when no part is moved.

The `static` mode exports the full scene graph, but parts inside this graph have a constant transform relative to its root part. The root node of the object however can still be moved, rotated, or scaled at no significant performance cost. Furthermore, individual parts are returned through ray cast hits or can be modified individually through state overrides (hidden state, selected, color tint etc.). The runtime cost of this mode is negligible compared to the dynamic case. Accordingly, this mode is ideal for large scenes that still need per-object inspection but no per-object transform changes.

The `none` mode has the least runtime overhead and also slightly better loading times. Inspection or transform of single objects is not possible in this mode. Use cases for this mode could be photogrammetry models that do not have a meaningful scene graph in the first place.

### Physics parameters

* `generateCollisionMesh` - To provide support fast ray casts, conversion creates a collision mesh.
If enabled, time is added to the conversion process and implies a performance penalty at runtime.
This parameter can be set to false when ray-cast support is not required.

### Unlit materials

* `unlitMaterials` - To override all materials in the scene to work as a constantly shaded surface that is independent of lighting. That is, all materials are created as [color materials](../../concepts/materials.md#color-material) as opposed to [PBR materials](../../concepts/materials.md#pbr-material).

### Coordinate system overriding

* `axis` - To override coordinate system unit-vectors. Default values are `["+x", "+y", "+z"]`, where sign means direction of a vector. In theory, the FBX format has a header where those vectors are defined and conversion uses that information to transform the scene, and the glTF format defines a fixed coordinate system with Y-axis up. In practice, some assets have wrong header or saved with wrong Up-axis and it could be overridden by this option. For example: `"axis" : ["+x", "+z", "-y"]` will exchange the Z-axis and the Y-axis and keep coordinate system handed-ness by inverting  the Y-axis to the opposite direction.

### Vertex format

This paragraph is for advanced use cases, where changing the vertex format is necessary to meet memory constraints. While there is some potential to save valuable GPU memory by tweaking the vertex format, there is a high risk to degrade the visual quality or even compromise stability of the server when the format is not appropriate.

The config file allows for modifying the output vertex structure:
* specific input data streams can be explicitly included or excluded
* the floating point accuracy of vertex components can be decreased to reduce the memory footprint

The following `vertex` section in the `.json` file is optional. For each portion that is not explicitly specified, the conversion service falls back to default, or `NONE` respectively, if not present in source model.

```json
{
    "ez": {
        ...
        "vertex" : {
            "position"  : "32_32_32_FLOAT",
            "color0"    : "NONE",
            "color1"    : "NONE",
            "normal"    : "NONE",
            "tangent"   : "NONE",
            "binormal"  : "NONE",
            "texcoord0" : "32_32_FLOAT",
            "texcoord1" : "NONE"
        },
        ...
```

By forcing a component to `NONE`, it is guaranteed that the output mesh does not have the respective stream.

#### Component formats per vertex stream

The following formats are supported per vertex input component:

| Vertex component | supported formats (default format is bold) |
|:-----------------|:------------------|
|position| **32_32_32_FLOAT**, 16_16_16_16_FLOAT |
|color0| **8_8_8_8_UNSIGNED_NORMALIZED**, NONE | 
|color1| 8_8_8_8_UNSIGNED_NORMALIZED, **NONE**|
|normal| **8_8_8_8_SIGNED_NORMALIZED**, 16_16_16_16_FLOAT, NONE |
|tangent| **8_8_8_8_SIGNED_NORMALIZED**, 16_16_16_16_FLOAT, NONE |
|binormal| **8_8_8_8_SIGNED_NORMALIZED**, 16_16_16_16_FLOAT, NONE |
|texcoord0| **32_32_FLOAT**, 16_16_FLOAT, NONE |
|texcoord1| **32_32_FLOAT**, 16_16_FLOAT, NONE |

#### Supported component formats

The respective memory footprints of the distinct formats are as follows:

| Format | description | memory (Bytes) |
|:-------|:------------|:---------------|
|32_32_FLOAT|two-component full floating point precision|8
|16_16_FLOAT|two-component half floating point precision|4
|32_32_32_FLOAT|three-component full floating point precision|12
|16_16_16_16_FLOAT|four-component half floating point precision|8
|8_8_8_8_UNSIGNED_NORMALIZED|four-component byte, normalized to 0..1 range|4
|8_8_8_8_SIGNED_NORMALIZED|four-component byte, normalized to -1..1 range|4

Here are some notes regarding best practices for component format changes:
* `position` : There are rare cases where reduced floating point accuracy is sufficient. **16_16_16_16_FLOAT** introduces noticeable quantization of the position, even for small models. Position format should always be left to **32_32_32_FLOAT**.
* `normal`, `tangent`, `binormal` : Typically these values are changed together. Unless there are noticeable lighting artifacts that result from normal quantization, there is no reason to use increased accuracy through format **16_16_16_16_FLOAT**. There are many use cases where these components can be set to **NONE**:
  * A normal, tangent, and binormal vector is only required when the material is lit. That is, when any material in the mesh is using [PBR material type](../../concepts/materials.md#pbr-material).
  * tangent and binormal are only needed when any of the lit materials uses a normal map texture.
  * [Color materials](../../concepts/materials.md#color-material) do not need normals, tangents, or binormals
  * the mentioned material criteria also apply for materials that are assigned during runtime.
* `texcoord0`, `texcoord1` : Texture coordinates can use reduced accuracy (**16_16_FLOAT**) when texture coordinates stay in small range (0..1) and if the textures are not too large. With only 11 bits of mantissa, a 16-bit float component can only address textures up to size 2048 per-pixel accurate. When using the half precision on texture coordinates when not appropriate, the texture mapping might be off.

#### Example

Here is some example how removing components can save memory:

Assume you have a source photogrammetry model with **100M vertices**. The source model provides `position`, `normal`, `tangent`, `binormal`, and `texcoord0`. Using the default format, the memory footprint of a vertex is **32 Bytes**, or **3.2 GB** of memory for all mesh vertices. Photogrammetry typically has the lighting baked into the textures and thus does not require dynamic lighting. Accordingly, `normal`, `tangent`, and `binormal` can be removed altogether. Furthermore, if texture coordinates stay in normalized (0..1) range, half precision (`16_16_FLOAT`) might be sufficient. With these optimizations, memory footprint goes down to **16 Bytes** or **1.6 GB** for all vertices.

## Typical use cases

Finding good import settings for given use case can be a tedious and time consuming process. On the other hand, conversion settings may have a significant impact on runtime performance of the converted mesh. Better runtime performance means either more detailed models can be rendered at a stable framerate or VMs with lower specs (and thus cheaper VMs) can be allocated.  
There are certain classes of use cases that qualify for specific optimizations. Exemplary use cases and some considerations on their settings are discussed here:

### Use case: Architectural visualization / large outdoor maps

* These types of scenes tend to be static as in they don't need movable/addressable parts. Accordingly, the `sceneGraphMode` can be set to `static`, which improves runtime performance. The scene's root node can still be moved, rotated, and scaled, for example to dynamically switch between 1:1 scale (for first person view) and table top view.
* Using movable parts often come in pair with ray casting to identify parts. Accordingly, if ray casts are not needed, the generation of the physics representation can be turned off via the `generateCollisionMesh` flag. Turning off collisions has significant impact on conversion times, runtime loading times, and also runtime per-frame update costs.
* If the application does not use the [cut planes feature](../../overview/features/cut-planes.md), the `opaqueMaterialDefaultSidedness` flag should be turned off as well. The performance gain is typically 20%-30%. However, cut planes can still be used, but there won't be backfaces when looking into the inner parts of objects, which looks counter-intuitive.

### Use case: Photogrammetry models

Models that originate from photogrammetry data typically do not come with a dedicated scene graph. Accordingly, the `sceneGraphMode` can be set to `none`. The impact is insignificant though, since the scene graph is not complex in the first place.

Due to the nature of photogrammetry data, materials do not need to go through a dynamic lighting pipeline in the renderer since the lighting is already baked into the textures. This fact can be utilized to gain slightly better performance and also a better memory footprint:

* The `unlitMaterials` flag turns all materials into [unlit color materials](../../concepts/materials.md#color-material) at conversion time
* The mesh data does not require normal-, tangent- or binormal vectors, which result in a more efficient vertex format and thus lower memory footprint. See [example](#example) above.

### Use case: Visualization of compact machines, etc.

These types of use cases are typically characterized by much detail compacted to a small spatial extent. The renderer can handle compacted volumes well since significant detail can be automatically discarded without any visual difference (for example triangles occluded by others or triangles that are too small to contribute to visible pixels). However, most of the optimizations mentioned in the previous use case do not apply here:

* Individual parts should be selectable and movable, so the `sceneGraphMode` must be left to default `dynamic`. 
* Accurate ray casts are typically integral part of the application, so collision meshes must be generated
* Cutplanes look better with the `opaqueMaterialDefaultSidedness` flag enabled
