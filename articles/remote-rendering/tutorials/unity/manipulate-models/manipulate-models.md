# Tutorial: Manipulating models

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Add Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) to the project.
> * Add visual and manipulation bounds around remotely rendered models.
> * Move, Rotate and Scale.
> * Raycast with spatial queries.
> * Simple animations for remotely rendered objects

## Prerequisites

* This tutorial builds on top of [Tutorial: Refining materials, lighting, and effects](..\materials-lighting-effects\materials-lighting-effects.md).

## Getting Started with Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)

The Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) is a cross-platform toolkit for building Mixed Reality experiences. We'll utilize MRTK for it's input and interaction scripts.

To add MRTK, follow the the [Required steps](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/GettingStartedWithTheMRTK.html#required) defined in [Getting started with MRTK](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/GettingStartedWithTheMRTK.html).

## Import assets used by this tutorial

Going forward from here, this tutorial implements a simple [model-view-controller pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) for much of the material covered. The *model* part of the pattern is all the Azure Remote Rendering specific code and the state management related to Azure Remote Rendering. The *view* and *controller* parts of the pattern are implemented using MRTK assets and some custom scripts. It is possible to be able to use the *model* in this tutorial without the *view-controller* implemented here. This separation allows you to easily integrate the code found in this tutorial into your own application, where your application will take over the *view-controller* part of the design pattern.

With the introduction of MRTK, there are a number of scripts, prefabs and assets that can now be added to the project to support interactions and visual feedback. These are bundled into a [Unity Asset Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html), which can be downloaded \[here](todo\path\to\asset-package).

1. Download the package \[here](todo\path\to\asset-package)
1. In your Unity project, choose **Assets** > **Import Package** > **Custom Package**.
1. In the file explorer, select the asset package you downloaded in step 1.
1. Select the **Import** button to import the contents of the package into your project.\
\
*If using the Universal Render Pipeline:*

1. In the Unity Editor, select **Mixed Reality Toolkit** > **Utilities** > **Upgrade MRTK Standard Shader for Lightweight Render Pipeline** from the top menu bar, and follow the prompts to upgrade the shader.

Most of view controllers in this tutorial operate against interfaces instead of against concrete classes. This provides better flexibility and allows the tutorial to provide the view controllers for you, while still allowing you to implement and learn the Azure Remote Rendering specific code yourself. For the purposes of this tutorial, the **RemoteRenderingCoordinator** class does not have an interface provided and it's view controller operates directly against the concrete class.

An interface has been provided for the **RemoteRenderedModel** script we created in a previous tutorial. To enable the view controller for models, modify the **RemoteRenderedModel** script to implement the interface by adding `IRemoteRenderedModel` to the class signature. It should look as follows:

```csharp
public class RemoteRenderedModel : MonoBehaviour, IRemoteRenderedModel
```

This allows the view controller to operate against not only **RemoteRenderedModel**, but any other version you'd like to create, so long as it implements the **IRemoteRenderedModel** interface.

You can now add the prefab **RemoteRenderingViewController** to the scene, for visual feedback of the current session state.

## Query remote object bounds and apply to local bounds

The [objects bounds](../../../concepts/object-bounds.md) are useful for quick manipulation of a remote object. We can query the bounds of a remotely rendered model from the current session, using the entity object created when loading a remotely rendered model. Querying the bounds happens after the model has been loaded into the remote session. The bounds of a model defined by the box or cuboid that contains the entire model. Exactly like Unity's [**BoxCollider**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-BoxCollider.html), which has a center and size defined for the x,y,z axes. In fact, we'll use Unity's **BoxCollider** to represent the bounds of the remote model.

1. Create a new script in the same directory as **RemoteRenderedModel** and name it **RemoteBounds**.
2. Replace the contents of the script with the following code:

```csharp
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE in the project root for license information.

using Microsoft.Azure.RemoteRendering;
using Microsoft.Azure.RemoteRendering.Unity;
using System;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

[RequireComponent(typeof(IRemoteRenderedModel), typeof(BoxCollider))]
public class RemoteBounds : MonoBehaviour
{
    //Remote bounds works with a specific remotely rendered model
    private IRemoteRenderedModel targetModel = null;
    //Update a bounding box with the remote bounds
    private BoxCollider boxCollider = null;
    private BoundsQueryAsync remoteBoundsQuery = null;

    public enum RemoteBoundsState
    {
        NotReady,
        Updating,
        Ready,
        Error
    }

    private RemoteBoundsState currentBoundsState = RemoteBoundsState.NotReady;

    public RemoteBoundsState CurrentBoundsState
    {
        get => currentBoundsState;
        private set
        {
            if (currentBoundsState != value)
            {
                currentBoundsState = value;
                OnBoundsStateChange?.Invoke(value);
            }
        }
    }

    public event Action<RemoteBoundsState> OnBoundsStateChange;

    public UnityEvent OnBoundsReady = new UnityEvent();
    public UnityEvent OnBoundsNotReady = new UnityEvent();
    public void Awake()
    {
        OnBoundsStateChange += HandleUnityEvents;
        targetModel = GetComponent<IRemoteRenderedModel>();
        boxCollider = GetComponent<BoxCollider>();

        targetModel.OnModelStateChange += TargetModel_OnModelStateChange;
        TargetModel_OnModelStateChange(targetModel.CurrentModelState);
    }

    private void HandleUnityEvents(RemoteBoundsState boundsState)
    {
        switch (boundsState)
        {
            case RemoteBoundsState.Ready:
                OnBoundsReady?.Invoke();
                break;
            default:
                OnBoundsNotReady?.Invoke();
                break;
        }
    }

    private void TargetModel_OnModelStateChange(ModelState state)
    {
        switch (state)
        {
            case ModelState.Loaded:
                QueryBounds();
                break;
            default:
                boxCollider.enabled = false;
                CurrentBoundsState = RemoteBoundsState.NotReady;
                break;
        }
    }

    // Create a query using the model entity
    private void QueryBounds()
    {
        //Implement me
    }

    // Check the result and apply it to the local Unity bounding box if it was successful
    private void ProcessQueryResult(BoundsQueryAsync remoteBounds)
    {
        //Implement me
    }
}
```

This script is intended to be added to the same GameObject as a script that implements the **IRemoteRenderedModel** script, in this case, that means the **RemoteRenderedModel**. Similar to previous scripts, this initial code will handle all the state changes, events and data related to remote bounds. There are two methods left to implement, the `QueryBounds` method that fetches the bounds and `ProcessQueryResult` which takes the result of the query and applies it to the local **BoxCollider**.

The `QueryBounds` method is straight forward: send a query to the remote rendering session and listen for the `Completed` event.

3. Replace the `QueryBounds` method with the following completed method:

```csharp
// Create a query using the model entity
private void QueryBounds()
{
    remoteBoundsQuery = targetModel.ModelEntity.QueryLocalBoundsAsync();
    CurrentBoundsState = RemoteBoundsState.Updating;
    remoteBoundsQuery.Completed += ProcessQueryResult;
}
```

`ProcessQueryResult` is similarly straight forward, we'll check the result to see if it was successful and if so, convert and apply the returned bounds in a format that the **BoxCollider** can accept.

4. Replace the `ProcessQueryResult` method with the following completed method:

```csharp
// Check the result and apply it to the local Unity bounding box if it was successful
private void ProcessQueryResult(BoundsQueryAsync remoteBounds)
{
    if (remoteBounds.IsRanToCompletion)
    {
        var newBounds = remoteBounds.Result.toUnity();
        boxCollider.center = newBounds.center;
        boxCollider.size = newBounds.size;
        boxCollider.enabled = true;
        CurrentBoundsState = RemoteBoundsState.Ready;
    }
    else
    {
        CurrentBoundsState = RemoteBoundsState.Error;
    }
}
```

Now, adding the **RemoteBounds** script to the same game object as the **RemoteRenderedModel** will result in a **BoxCollider** also being added and when the model reaches its `Loaded` state, the bounds will automatically be queried and applied to the **BoxCollider**.

1. Using the **TestEngine** GameObject created previously. Add the **RemoteBounds** component.
1. Confirm the script is added and also added a **BoxCollider** component.\
 ![Add RemoteBounds component](./media/remote-bounds-script.png)\
1. Run the application again. Shortly after the model loads, you will be able to see the bounds for the remote object. Something like the below values:\
 ![Bounds updated](./media/updated-bounds.png)\

Now we have a local **BoxCollider** configured with accurate bounds on the local Unity object. This allows visualization and interaction with these bounds using any of the strategies we'd use to interact with a locally rendered object, i.e. scripts that alter the Transform, physics, etc.

## Move, rotate, and scale  

Moving, rotating and scaling remotely rendered objects is exactly like doing the same with any other Unity object. The **RemoteRenderingCoordinator**, in it's `LateUpdate` method is calling `Update` on the currently active session. Part of what `Update` does is sync local model entity transforms with their remote counterparts. This means in order to move/rotate/scale a remotely rendered model, you only need move/rotate/scale the transform of the GameObject representing remote model. Here, we're going to modify the transform of the parent GameObject that has the **RemoteRenderedModel** script attached to it.

This tutorial is using MRTK for object interaction. In the included tutorial assets there is a view controller prefab and script for remotely rendered models called **RemoteModelViewController**. This view controller comes pre-configured inside of a prefab **ModelViewController**.

1. Locate the **ModelViewController** prefab in *Assets/RemoteRenderingTutorial/Prefabs/ModelViewController*
1. Ensure the TestEngine GameObject created previously is in the scene.
1. Drag the **ModelViewController** prefab into the scene, dropping it on top of the **TestEngine** GameObject, making the new prefab a child of the **TestEngine** GameObject.\
![View controller child](./media/view-controller-child.png)\
1. Press Unity's Play button to play the scene and see the view controller.
![View controller](./media/model-with-view-controller.png)\

This view controller script will show an interface with the model's name and controls specific to the model. The controls available will depend on the scripts attached to the target GameObject. When the GameObject contains a **RemoteBounds** component, the view controller will adds a [**BoundingBox**](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_BoundingBox.html) component, which is an MRTK component that renders a bounding box around an object that has a **BoxCollider**. Further, the **RemoteModelViewController** also adds [**ManipulationHandler**](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_ManipulationHandler.html), which is responsible for hand interactions like dragging and two handed interactions like rotating and scaling. These scripts combined will allow us to move, rotate and scale the remotely rendered model.

## Ray cast and spatial queries of remote models

A box collider around models is suitable for interacting with the entire model, but not detailed enough to interact with individual parts of a model. This is where [remote ray casting](../../../overview/features/spatial-queries.md#ray-casts) comes in. Remote ray casting is an API provided by Azure Remote Rendering to cast rays into the remote scene, and return hit results locally. This technique can be used for selecting child entities of a large model and/or getting very specific information about hit results like: position, surface normal and distance.

The test engine has a number of sub-meshes that can be queried and selected. For now, the selection will simply output the name of the selected Entity to the Unity Console. Check the [Materials, lighting and effects](../materials-lighting-effects/materials-lighting-effects.md#highlighting-and-outlining) chapter for highlighting the selected Entity.

First let's create a static wrapper around the remote ray cast queries. This script will accept a position and direction in Unity space, convert it to the data types accepted by the remote ray cast, and finally return the results. The script will make use of the `RayCastQueryAsync` API.

1. Create a new script called **RemoteRayCaster** and replace it's contents with the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.RemoteRendering;
using Microsoft.Azure.RemoteRendering.Unity;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using UnityEngine;

public class RemoteRayCaster
{
    public static double maxDistance = 30.0;

    public static async Task<RayCastHit[]> RemoteRayCast(Vector3 origin, Vector3 dir, HitCollectionPolicy hitPolicy = HitCollectionPolicy.ClosestHit)
    {
        if(RemoteRenderingCoordinator.instance.CurrentCoordinatorState == RemoteRenderingState.RuntimeConnected)
        {
            var rayCast = new RayCast(origin.toRemotePos(), dir.toRemoteDir(), maxDistance, hitPolicy);
            return await RemoteRenderingCoordinator.CurrentSession.Actions.RayCastQueryAsync(rayCast).AsTask();
        }
        else
        {
            return new RayCastHit[0];
        }
    }

    public static async Task<Entity[]> RemoteRayCastEntities(Vector3 origin, Vector3 dir, HitCollectionPolicy hitPolicy = HitCollectionPolicy.ClosestHit)
    {
        var hits = await RemoteRayCast(origin, dir, hitPolicy);
        return hits.Select(hit => hit.HitEntity).Where(entity => entity != null).ToArray();
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Unity has a class named [`RaycastHit`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RaycastHit.html), and Azure Remote Rendering has a class named `RayCastHit`. The uppercase **C** is an important difference to avoid compile errors.

2. **RemoteRayCaster** provides an common access point for casting remote rays into the current session. To be more specific, next we'll implement an MRTK pointer handler. The script will implement the `IMixedRealityPointerHandler` interface, which will tell MRTK we want this script to listen for [Mixed Reality Pointer](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/Input/Pointers.html) events. Create a new script called **RemoteRaycastPointerHandler** and replace the code with the following:

```csharp
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE in the project root for license information.

using Microsoft.Azure.RemoteRendering;
using Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Input;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

public class RemoteRaycastPointerHandler : MonoBehaviour, IMixedRealityPointerHandler
{
    [Serializable] public class UnityRemoteEntityEvent : UnityEvent<Entity> { }

    public UnityRemoteEntityEvent OnRemoteEntityClicked = new UnityRemoteEntityEvent();

    public async void OnPointerClicked(MixedRealityPointerEventData eventData)
    {
        if (OnRemoteEntityClicked != null) //Ensure someone is listening before we do the work
        {
            var firstHit = await PointerDataToRemoteRayCast(eventData.Pointer);
            if (firstHit.success)
                OnRemoteEntityClicked.Invoke(firstHit.hit.HitEntity);
        }
    }

    public void OnPointerDown(MixedRealityPointerEventData eventData) { }

    public void OnPointerDragged(MixedRealityPointerEventData eventData) { }

    public void OnPointerUp(MixedRealityPointerEventData eventData) { }

    private async Task<(bool success, RayCastHit hit)> PointerDataToRemoteRayCast(IMixedRealityPointer pointer, HitCollectionPolicy hitPolicy = HitCollectionPolicy.ClosestHit)
    {
        RayCastHit hit;
        var result = pointer.Result;
        if (result != null)
        {
            var endPoint = result.Details.Point;
            var direction = pointer.Rays[pointer.Result.RayStepIndex].Direction;
            hit = (await RemoteRayCaster.RemoteRayCast(endPoint, direction, hitPolicy)).FirstOrDefault();
        }
        else
        {
            hit = new RayCastHit();
        }
        return (hit.HitEntity != null, hit);
    }
}
```

**RemoteRaycastPointerHandler**'s `OnPointerClicked` method is what's called by MRTK when a Pointer 'clicks' on a local collider. From there `PointerDataToRemoteRayCast` is called to convert the pointer's result into a point and direction. That point and direction are then used to cast a remote ray in the active session.

![Bounds updated](./media/raycast-local-remote.png)

This is the simple, efficient strategy for querying remote objects. Since we're only sending remote requests on click. However, it's not an ideal user experience, since the local pointer is rendered colliding with the box collider and not the model itself. A more complex, less efficient, but better user experience would be to create a new MRTK pointer that casts its rays in the remote session every frame. This more complex strategy is outside the scope of this tutorial, but an example of this approach can be seen in the Showcase App, found in the [ARR samples repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-remote-rendering/tree/master/Unity/AzureRemoteRenderingShowcase).

When a successful ray cast is completed in the **RemoteRaycastPointerHandler**, the hit `Entity` is emitted with the `OnRemoteEntityClicked` event. To respond to that event, we'll create a helper script that accepts the `Entity` and performs an action on it. Starting simple, the script will print the name of the `Entity` to the debug log.

1. Create a new script named **RemoteEntityHelper** and replace its contents with the below:

```csharp
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE in the project root for license information.

using Microsoft.Azure.RemoteRendering;
using UnityEngine;

public class RemoteEntityHelper : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void EntityToDebugLog(Entity entity)
    {
        Debug.Log(entity.Name);
    }
}
```

2. On the **TestModel** GameObject created previously, add both the **RemoteRaycastPointerHandler** component and the **RemoteEntityHelper** component.
1. Assign the `EntityToDebugLog` method to the `OnRemoteEntityClicked` event. When the event output type and method input type match, we can use Unity's dynamic event hookup, that will automatically pass the event value into the method.\
![Assign event](./media/remote-entity-event.png)
1. Press play in the Unity Editor to start the scene, connect to a remote session and load the test model.
1. Using [MRTK's hand simulation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/InputSimulation/InputSimulationService.html#hand-simulation), press and hold the left Shift key.
1. Steer the simulated hand so the hand ray is pointing to the test engine.\
![Pointed hand ray](./media/handray-engine.png)
1. Click to perform a simulated air-tap, executing the `OnPointerClicked` event.
1. Observe the Unity Console for a log message with the name of the child entity selected. For example:\
![Child entity example](./media/subcomponent-example.png)

We've now used MRTK's hand rays to cast a ray at the box collider, upon collision another remote ray cast continued from the location outside the bounds. Try clicking around the mode to identify various parts, according to the names of the child entities.

## Synchronizing and filtering the remote object graph into the Unity hierarchy

## Animating remote content

## Next steps

You can manipulate and interact with your remotely rendered models. In the next tutorial we'll cover modifying materials, altering the lighting and applying certain effects to remotely rendered models.
