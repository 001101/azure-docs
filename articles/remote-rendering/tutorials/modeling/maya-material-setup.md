# Creating Physically Based Rendering materials in Maya

## Overview
Creating Physically Based Rendering (**PBR**) materials in Maya is a relatively straight forward task, similar in many ways to PBR set-up in other content creation apps like 3DS Max. The following is a guide to basic PBR shader set-up and FBX export for ARR projects. 

The Sample scene provided contains a number of Polygon Box objects which have been assigned  a number of different materials - Wood, Metal, Painted Metal, Plastic and Rubber. Broadly speaking, each material contains all or most of the following textures 

* **Albedo**, also called 'Diffuse' which is the materials colour map, 
* **Metalness**,  which determines if a material is metallic and which parts are metallic. 
* **Roughness**, which determines how rough or smooth a surface is, affecting the sharpness or blurriness of the reflections and highlights on a surface, 
* **Normals**, which add detail to a surface, for example pitting and dents on a metal surface or grain in wood, without having to add more polygons, 
* **Ambient Occlusion**, which is used to add soft shading and contact shadows to a model. It is a grey-scale map that indicates which areas of a model receive full lighting (white) or full shade (Black). 

## Setting up
In Maya the process for setting up a PBR material is as follows. 

To begin with, as you will see in the Sample Scene, we have created a number of Box objects, each of which represents a different type of material. Note, as shown in the image below, that each of these objects has been given it's own appropriate name 

> It is worth noting before starting to create assets for Azure Remote Rendering (ARR) that it uses meters for measurement and the up-direction is Y-Axis. Therefore it is advisable to set you scene Units in Maya to Meters. Furthermore, it is advisable when exporting to set Units to meters in the FBX Export settings. 

**It is good practice to name your model assets appropriately, usually with the relevant part or material type, as this will make navigating object-heavy scenes easier.**

Once you have created/acquired your textures - depending on your needs, you may want to create unique textures for a model in texturing apps like Quixel Suite, Photoshop or Substance suite or you may be using generic tiling textures from other sources, you can apply them to your model as follows; 

* In your scene viewport, select your model/geometry and right click over it. In the menu that appears click 'Assign New Material' 
* In the Assign New Material Options, go to Maya>Stingray PBS. This will assign a PBR material to your model. 

>In Maya 2020, there are a number of different PBR shaders available - Maya Standard Surface, Arnold  Standard Surface and Stingray PBR. The Maya Standard Surface Shader is not yet exportable via the FBX plugin 2020, whereas the Arnold Standard Surface Shader can be exported with FBX files. In most other respects it is identical to the Maya Standard Surface Shader and is analogous to the Physical Material in 3D Studio Max.  
>**The Stingray PBR shader** is compatible with many other applications and most closely matches the requirements of ARR and it's supported since Maya 2017. Also it is convenient that this type of materials visualized in viewport very similar to what will be visualized later in the service.

With your material assigned to your asset and named appropriately you can now proceed to assigning  your various textures. The following images detail where each texture type fits in to the PBR material. The Stingray PBR material allows you to select which attributes you can activate, so before you can 'plug in' your texture maps you will need to activate the relevant attributes:

It's Good practice to name your materials appropriately, taking into account their use and/or type. A material which is to be used on a unique part might be named for that part while a material which can be used on a wider number of areas can be named for it's properties or type; 

Assign your textures as follows:

With your PBR Materials created and set up, it is worth thinking about Instancing objects in your scene. Instancing similar objects in your scene - such as nuts, bolts, screws washers - essentially any objects that are the same can yield significant savings in terms of file size. Instances of a master object can have their own scale, rotation and transforms so can be placed as required in your scene. In Maya, the process of Instancing is simple.

* In the Edit menu, go to Duplicate Special and open the Options, 
* In the Duplicate Special Options switch Geometry Type from 'Copy' to 'Instance', 
* Click 'Duplicate Special'

This will create an instance of your object which can be moved rotated or scaled independently of its parent and of other instances of that parent. 
>However - any changes you make to an instance while in component mode will be transmitted to all instances of your object, so if you are working with an instanced objects components - vertices, polygon faces etc be sure first that you want any changes you make to affect all of these instances.

In the Sample Scene, each individual box object has been instanced. This will have relevance when we export the scene to FBX format.

>Best Practice regarding instancing in your scene is to create them as you go along, as replacing 'Copies' with Instanced objects later is extremely difficult. 

## FBX Export Process

We can now move on to the FBX export of your scene or scene assets. Generally speaking, it makes sense when exporting assets to only select for export those objects/assets from your scene that you want. If you have 100 objects in a scene but you only want to use 30 of them, there is no point in exporting the whole scene. So unless you are happy to export the entire scene, make your selection and go to; 

* File > Export Selection and in the export dialogue go to the bottom and set 'Files of Type' to 'Fbx Export'. This will expose the Fbx Export settings. The Primary settings for Fbx Export are highlighted in red in the image below;

Depending on you requirements - for example, you may want to send an asset to a client, but don't want to send large numbers of texture files with the asset, you can choose to embed the textures within the Exported FBX file. This means that you only have one file to package, but it will significantly increase the size of that FBX asset. You can enable the option to embed textures by switching on the 'Embed Media' option as shown below.

> Notice that the file in this case has been named to reflect this condition. This is a 'Good Practice' means of keeping track of your assets. 

Once you have set your configuration for Export, click 'Export Selection'.

## Conclusion

In general this type of materials looks more realistic as it is based on real world physics. It creates an additional immersive effect that the scene exists in the real world.
