# StorSimple 8000 Series Update 5 release notes

## Overview

The following release notes describe the new features and identify the critical open issues for StorSimple 8000 Series Update 5. They also contain a list of the StorSimple software updates included in this release. 

Update 5 can be applied to any StorSimple device running Release (GA) or Update 0.1 through Update 3.1. The device version associated with Update 5 is 6.3.9600.17820.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Update 5 has device software, USM firmware, LSI driver and firmware, disk firmware, Storport and Spaceport, security, and other OS updates. It takes approximately 4 hours to install this update. Disk firmware update is a disruptive update and results in a downtime for your device. We recommend that you apply Update 5 to keep your device up-to-date. 
> * For new releases, you may not see updates immediately because we do a phased rollout of the updates. Wait a few days, and then scan for updates again as these will become available soon.

For more information, go to [authentication URLs listed in the networking requirements for your StorSimple device]().
