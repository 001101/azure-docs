# Options to migrate data from StorSimple 5000-7000 series 
StorSimple 5000-7000 series is reaching [end of Support](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search?alpha=StorSimple%205000%2F7000%20Series) in July 2019. The customers who are running StorSimple 5000-7000 series have an option to upgrade to other Azure first party hybrid services. This article describes the Azure hybrid options available to migrate data. 

## Migration options

StorSimple 5000-7000 series customer have the following two key options:

- **Upgrade to StorSimple 8000 Series** – Upgrade to StorSimple 8000 series and thus continue on StorSimple platform.  This upgrade path requires customers to replace their 5000-7000 series devices with an 8000 series. The data is migrated from the 5000-7000 series device by using the migration tool. Once the migration is successfully complete, the StorSimple 8000 series devices will continue to tier data to Azure Blob Storage. 

    For more information on how to migrate data using a StorSimple 8000 series, go to [Migrate data from StorSimple 5000-7000 series to 8000 series device](storsimple-8000-migrate-from-5000-7000.md).

- **Migrate to Azure File Sync** – This brand new migration option enables customers to store their organization’s file shares in the Azure Files. These files shares are then centralized for on-premises access using Azure File Sync (AFS). AFS can be deployed on a Windows Server host. The actual data migration is then performed as a host copy or using the migration tool.
