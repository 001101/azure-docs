# Event Grid event schema

This article provides the properties and schema for events. The **data** object contains properties that are specific to each resource provider.

The array can contain multiple events objects.  
 
## Event properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| topic | string | Full resource path to the event source. |
| subject | string | Publisher defined path to the event subject. |
| eventType | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| eventTime | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| data | object | Event data specific to the resource provider. |

    // event version (under consideration), controls the A-Schema
