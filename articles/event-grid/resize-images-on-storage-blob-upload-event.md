# Automate the resizing of uploaded images using Event Grid



![Published web app in Edge browser](./media/resize-images-on-storage-blob-upload-event/tutorial-completed.png) 
In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure Storage account
> * Define blob containers in Azure Storage
> * Deploy serverless function code using Azure Functions
> * Configure Event Grid 
> * Deploy a web app to Azure

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart:
* [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/).
* You need an active [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Download the sample app locally

In a terminal window, run the following commands. This clones the sample application to your local machine and navigates to the directory that contains the sample.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/integration-image-upload-resize-storage-functions
cd integration-image-upload-resize-storage-functions
```
## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create). An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources like topics and subscriptions, function apps, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.

The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup`.  
If you are not using Cloud Shell, you must first sign in using `az login`.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westeurope
```

## Create an Azure Storage account

The sample uploads images to a blob container in an Azure Storage account. Create a storage account in the resource group you created by using the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#create) command.

In the following command, substitute your own globally unique storage account name where you see the `<storage_name>` placeholder. Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account create --name <storage_name> \
--location westeurope --resource-group myResourceGroup \
--sku Standard_LRS
```

## Configure storage

The app uses two blob containers: _images_ for uploaded images, and _thumbs_ for resized thumbnail images. The following commands get the first shared key for the storage account and use it to create the two containers. 

```azurecli-interactive
storageaccount=<storage_name>

storageAccountKey=$(az storage account keys list -g myResourceGroup \
-n $storageaccount --query [0].value --output tsv)

az storage container create -n images --account-name $storageaccount \ 
--account-key $storageAccountKey

az storage container create -n thumbs --account-name $storageaccount \ 
--account-key $storageAccountKey


```
After the blob containers are created, you can configure the sample app to connect to your storage account.

## Configure the sample app

In the sample app you downloaded, open the appsettings.json file. Set AzureStorageConfig.AccountName and AzureStorageConfig.AccountKey to the name of the storage account and the key.  

## Create a function app  

You must have a function app to host the execution of your functions. The function app provides an environment for serverless execution of your function code. Create a function app by using the [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#create) command. 

In the following command, substitute your own unique function app name where you see the `<function_app_name>` placeholder. The `<function_app>` is used as the default DNS domain for the function app, and so the name needs to be unique across all apps in Azure. $storageaccount is the storage account name variable defined in the previous command.  

```azurecli-interactive
$functionapp=<function_app>

az functionapp create --name $functionapp --storage-account  $storageaccount  \
--resource-group myResourceGroup --consumption-plan-location westeurope
```
You can now use Git to deploy your function code to this function app.

## Deploy the function code 

The function code that performs image resizing is available in a public GitHub repo: <https://github.com/Azure-Samples/function-image-upload-resize>. In the following command, $functionapp is the same function app name variable defined in the previous script.

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp deployment source config --name $functionapp \
 --resource-group myResourceGroup \
 --repo-url https://github.com/Azure-Samples/function-image-upload-resize \
 --branch master \
 --manual-integration
```

The function code is deployed directly from the public sample repo. To learn more about deployment options for Azure Functions, see [Continuous deployment for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment.md).

<<TBD: do we want to have users test an HTTP endpoint on the app?>>


## Configure the event grid

## Test the sample app locally

## Deploy to Azure

Do a VS publish to a new web app

## Test the sample app in Azure
