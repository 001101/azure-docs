# Event sources in Azure Event Grid
An event source is where the event happens. Several Azure services are automatically configured to send events. You can also create custom applications that send events. Custom applications don't need to be hosted in Azure to use Event Grid for event distribution.

This article provides links to content for each event source.

## Event sources

- [Azure App Configuration](event-schema-app-configuration.md)
- [Azure Blob Storage](event-schema-blob-storage.md)
- [Azure Container Registry](event-schema-container-registry.md)
- [Azure Event Hubs](event-schema-event-hubs.md)
- [Azure IoT Hub](event-schema-iot-hub.md)
- [Azure Key Vault](event-schema-key-vault.md)
- [Azure Machine Learning](event-schema-machine-learning.md)
- [Azure Maps](event-schema-azure-maps.md)
- [Azure Media Services](event-schema-media-services.md)
- [Azure resource groups](event-schema-resource-groups.md)
- [Azure Service Bus](event-schema-service-bus.md)
- [Azure SignalR](event-schema-azure-signalr.md)
- [Azure subscriptions](event-schema-subscriptions.md)
