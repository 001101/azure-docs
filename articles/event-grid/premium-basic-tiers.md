# Azure Event Grid premium and basic tiers
Azure Event Grid has two tiers: **Premium** and **Basic**. The basic tier uses consumption, or pay-as-you-go pricing. It gives you all of the standard pub/sub tools you need to use Event Grid for event-driven programming models. The premium tier takes this one step further with security features aimed at the enterprise. The premium SKU is in early **public preview** with many of its features still under development.

## Overview
All custom topics and event domains in Event Grid are either Basic tier or Premium tier. All topics and domains created with API versions before `03-13-2020-preview` default to basic tier. The premium tier has all the features of the basic tier and more such as virtual network (VNet) integration via private endpoints. It's priced on an hourly basis as opposed to consumption pricing of standard tier.

## Capabilities and features

The following table describes the security, performance, and SLA differences between the SKUs:

## Pricing and quotas
See [Event Grid pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/event-grid/) for the pricing details of using the standard tier. The Premium SKU pricing isn't yet announced and is free until pricing is available.

The existing quotas on topic and domain count, and throughput apply to both premium and basic tier resources until premium tier pricing is announced.

## Next steps
You can configure IP firewall for your Event Grid resource to restrict access over the public internet from only a select set of IP Addresses or IP Address ranges. For step-by-step instructions, see [Configure firewall](configure-firewall.md).

You can configure private endpoints to restrict access from only from selected virtual networks. For step-by-step instructions, see [Configure private endpoints](configure-private-endpoints.md).
