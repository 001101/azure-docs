# Configure private endpoints for Event Grid topics or domains
You can use [private endpoints](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) to allow ingress of events directly from your virtual network to your topics and domains securely over a [private link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md) without going through the public internet. The private endpoint uses an IP address from the VNet address space for your topic or domain. For more information, see [Network security](network-security.md).

This article describes how to configure private endpoints for Event Grid topics or domains.

## Use Azure portal 

1. Switch to the **Networking** tab of your Event Grid topic page. Select **+ Private endpoint** on the toolbar.

2. One the **Basics** page, follow these steps: 
    1. Select an **Azure subscription** in which you want to create the private endpoint. 
    2. Select an **Azure resource group** for the private endpoint. 
    3. Enter a **name** for the endpoint. 
    4. Select the **region** for the endpoint. Your private endpoint must be in the same region as your virtual network, but can in a different region from the private link resource (in this example, the Event Grid topic). 
    5. Then, select **Next: Resource >** button at the bottom of the page.

3. On the **Resource** page, follow these steps: 
    1. For connection method, select **Connect to an Azure resource in my directory**. This example shows how to connect to an Azure resource in your directory. You can also connect to someone else's resource with a resource ID or alias that they've shared with you. 
    2. Select the **Azure subscription** in which your **Event Grid topic/domain** exists. 
    3. For **Resource type**, Select **Microsoft.EventGrid/topics** or **Microsoft.EventGrid/domains** for the **Resource type**.
    4. For **Resource**, select an Event Grid topic/domain from the drop-down list. 
    5. Confirm that the **Target subresource** is set to **topic** or **domain** (based on the resource type you selected).
    6. Select **Next: Configuration >** button at the bottom of the page.

4. On the **Configuration** page, you select the subnet in a virtual network to where you want to deploy the private endpoint. 
    1. Select a **virtual network**. Only virtual networks in the currently selected subscription and location are listed in the drop-down list. 
    2. Select a **subnet** in the virtual network you selected. 
    3. Select **Next: Tags >** button at the bottom of the page. 

    ![Private endpoint - configuration page](./media/configure-private-endpoints/private-endpoint-configuration-page.png)
5. On the **Tags** page, create any tags (names and values) that you want to associate with the private endpoint resource. Then, select **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page. 
6. On the **Review + create**, review all the settings, and select **Create** to create the private endpoint.
