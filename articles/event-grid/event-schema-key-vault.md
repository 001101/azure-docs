## Event examples

The following example shows the schema of a **GeofenceEntered** event

```JSON

   "topic":"/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Maps/accounts/{accountName}", 
   "subject":"/spatial/geofence/udid/{udid}/id/{eventId}", 
   "data":{   
      "geometries":[
