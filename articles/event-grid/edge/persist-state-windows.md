# Persist state in Windows

Topics and subscriptions created in the Event Grid module are by default stored in the container filesystem. Without persistence, if the module were redeployed then all the metadata created would be lost. To preserve the data across deployments, you will need to persist the data outside the container filesystem. Currently only metadata is persisted. Events are stored in-memory. If Event Grid module is redeployed or restarted, then any undelivered events will be lost.

The rest of the document details the steps needed to deploy Event Grid module with persistence in Windows deployments.

> [!NOTE]
>The Event Grid module runs as a low-privileged user **ContainerUser** in Windows.

## Option 1: Persistence via volume mount

We make use of [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to preserve the data across deployments. To mount a volume you need to create it using docker commands, give permissions so that the container can read, write to it and then deploy the module. There is no provision to automatically create the volume with necessary permissions on Windows. These need to be created before deploying.

1. Create a volume by running the below command

    ```sh
    docker -H npipe:////./pipe/iotedge_moby_engine volume create <your-volume-name-here>
    ```

    For example,

   ```sh
   docker -H npipe:////./pipe/iotedge_moby_engine volume create myeventgridvol
   ```

1. Get the host directory that the volume maps to by running the below command

    ```sh
    docker -H npipe:////./pipe/iotedge_moby_engine volume inspect <your-volume-name-here>
    ```

    For example,

   ```sh
   docker -H npipe:////./pipe/iotedge_moby_engine volume inspect myeventgridvol
   ```

   Sample Output:-

   ```json
   [
          {
            "CreatedAt": "2019-07-30T21:20:59Z",
            "Driver": "local",
            "Labels": {},
            "Mountpoint": "C:\\ProgramData\\iotedge-moby\u000bolumes\\myeventgridvol\\_data",
            "Name": "myeventgridvol",
            "Options": {},
            "Scope": "local"
          }
   ]
   ```

1. Add the group **Users** to value pointed by **Mountpoint** as follows:
    1. Open File Explorer
    1. Navigate to the folder pointed by **Mountpoint**
    1. Right-click and go to properties
    1. Select **Security**
    1. Under *Group or user names: click on **Edit**
    1. Click on **Add** and enter `Users` and click on **Check Names** and click **Ok**
    1. Under *Permissions for Users*, select `Modify` and click **Ok**

1. Use **Binds** to mount this volume and redeploy Event Grid module from Azure portal

   For example,

    ```json
        {
              "Env": [
                "inbound:serverAuth:tlsPolicy=strict",
                "inbound:serverAuth:serverCert:source=IoTEdge",
                "inbound:clientAuth:sasKeys:enabled=false",
                "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:enabled=true",
                "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:source=IoTEdge",
                "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:allowUnknownCA=true",
                "outbound:clientAuth:clientCert:enabled=true",
                "outbound:clientAuth:clientCert:source=IoTEdge",
                "outbound:webhook:httpsOnly=true",
                "outbound:webhook:skipServerCertValidation=false",
                "outbound:webhook:allowUnknownCA=true"
              ],
              "HostConfig": {
                "Binds": [
                  "<your-volume-name-here>:C:\\app\\metadataDb"
                ],
                "PortBindings": {
                  "4438/tcp": [
                     {
                        "HostPort": "4438"
                     }
                  ]
                }
              }
        }
    ```

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >Do not change the second of the bind value. It points to a specific location in the module. For Event Grid module on windows it has to be **C:\\app\\metadataDb**.


    For example,

    ```json
    {
        "Env": [
            "inbound:serverAuth:tlsPolicy=strict",
            "inbound:serverAuth:serverCert:source=IoTEdge",
            "inbound:clientAuth:sasKeys:enabled=false",
            "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:enabled=true",
            "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:source=IoTEdge",
            "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:allowUnknownCA=true",
            "outbound:clientAuth:clientCert:enabled=true",
            "outbound:clientAuth:clientCert:source=IoTEdge",
            "outbound:webhook:httpsOnly=true",
            "outbound:webhook:skipServerCertValidation=false",
            "outbound:webhook:allowUnknownCA=true"
         ],
         "HostConfig": {
            "Binds": [
                "myeventgridvol:C:\\app\\metadataDb"
             ],
             "PortBindings": {
                    "4438/tcp": [
                         {
                            "HostPort": "4438"
                          }
                    ]
              }
         }
    }
    ```

## Option 2: Persistence via host directory mount

Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory on the host system and mount that directory.

1. Create a directory on the host filesystem by running the below command.

   ```sh
   mkdir <your-directory-name-here>
   ```

   For example,

   ```sh
   mkdir C:\myhostdir
   ```

1. Use **Binds** to mount your directory and redeploy Event Grid module from Azure portal

    ```json
    {
         "HostConfig": {
            "Binds": [
                "<your-directory-name-here>:C:\\app\\metadataDb"
             ]
         }
    }
    ```

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >Do not change the second part of the bind value. It points to a specific location in the module. For Event Grid module on windows it has to be **C:\\app\\metadataDb**.

    For example,

    ```json
    {
        "Env": [
            "inbound:serverAuth:tlsPolicy=strict",
            "inbound:serverAuth:serverCert:source=IoTEdge",
            "inbound:clientAuth:sasKeys:enabled=false",
            "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:enabled=true",
            "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:source=IoTEdge",
            "inbound:clientAuth:clientCert:allowUnknownCA=true",
            "outbound:clientAuth:clientCert:enabled=true",
            "outbound:clientAuth:clientCert:source=IoTEdge",
            "outbound:webhook:httpsOnly=true",
            "outbound:webhook:skipServerCertValidation=false",
            "outbound:webhook:allowUnknownCA=true"
         ],
         "HostConfig": {
            "Binds": [
                "C:\\myhostdir:C:\\app\\metadataDb"
             ],
             "PortBindings": {
                    "4438/tcp": [
                         {
                            "HostPort": "4438"
                          }
                    ]
              }
         }
    }
    ```
