# Tutorial: Publish, subscribe to events locally
This article walks you through all the steps needed to publish and subscribe to events using Event Grid on IoT Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn about Azure Event Grid topics and subscriptions, see [Event Grid Concepts](concepts.md).

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **Azure Event Grid module on An IoT Edge device**. If you don't have this set up already, follow steps in the [Deploy Event Grid IoT Edge module](deploy-event-grid-portal.md) article.
- **Azure Function subscriber module on the same IoT Edge Device**. If you haven't deployed this module already, follow steps in the [Deploy Azure Function IoT Edge module](deploy-func-webhook-module-portal.md) article. 

## Step 1: Create topic
As a publisher of an event, you need to create an event grid topic. In Azure Event Grid, a topic refers to an endpoint where publishers can send events to.

1. Create topic.json with the following content. For details about the payload, see our [API documentation](api.md).

   ```json
   {
       "name": "sampleTopic1",
       "properties" : {
          "inputschema": "eventGridSchema",
       },
   }
   ```

1. Run the following command to create an event grid topic. Confirm that you see the HTTP status code is `200 OK`.

    ```sh
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -g -d @topic.json https://<your-edge-device-public-ip-here>:4438/topics/sampleTopic1?api-version=2019-01-01-preview
    ```

## Step 2: Create event subscription

Subscribers can register for events published to a topic. To receive any event, you'll need to create an Event Grid subscription for a topic of interest.

1. Create subscription.json with the following content. For details about the payload, see our [API documentation](api.md) 

   ```json
    {
      "properties": {
        "destination": {
          "endpointType": "WebHook",
          "properties": {
            "endpointUrl": "http://subscriber:80/api/subscriber"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

   >[!NOTE]
   > The **endpointType** property specifies that the subscriber is a **Webhook**.  The **endpointUrl** specifies the URL at which the subscriber is listening for events. This URL corresponds to the Azure Function sample you deployed earlier.

2. Run the following command to create a subscription for the topic. Confirm that you see the HTTP status code is `200 OK`.

    ```sh
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -g -d @subscription.json https://<your-edge-device-public-ip-here>:4438/topics/sampleTopic1/eventSubscriptions/sampleSubscription1?api-version=2019-01-01-preview
    ```

## Step 3: Publish event

1. Create event.json with the following content. For details about the payload, see our [API documentation](api.md).

   ```json
   [{
       "id": "eventId-func-0",
       "eventType": "recordInserted",
       "subject": "myapp/vehicles/motorcycles",
       "eventTime": "2019-07-28T21:03:07+00:00",
       "dataVersion": "1.0",
       "data": {
            "make": "Ducati",
            "model": "Monster"
        },
    }]
    ```

1. Run the following command to publish an event.

    ```sh
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -g -d @event.json https://<your-edge-device-public-ip-here>:4438/topics/sampleTopic1/events?api-version=2019-01-01-preview
    ```

## Step 4: Verify event delivery

1. SSH or RDP into your IoT Edge VM.
1. Check the subscriber logs.

    On Windows, run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker -H npipe:////./pipe/notedly_moby_engine container logs subscriber
    ```
    
   On Linux, run the following command: 

    ```sh
    sudo docker logs subscriber
    ```

    Sample output: 

    ```json
    Received event data [
        {
          "id": "eventId-func-0",
          "topic": "sampleTopic1",
          "subject": "myapp/vehicles/motorcycles",
          "eventType": "recordInserted",
          "eventTime": "2019-07-28T21:03:07+00:00",
          "dataVersion": "1.0",
          "metadataVersion": "1",
          "data": {
            "make": "Ducati",
            "model": "Monster"
          }
        }
      ]
    ```

## Cleanup resources

* Run the following command to delete the topic and all its subscriptions.

    ```sh
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X DELETE https://<your-edge-device-public-ip-here>:4438/topics/sampleTopic1?api-version=2019-01-01-preview
    ```

* Delete the subscriber module from your IoT Edge device.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an event grid topic, subscription, and published events. Now that you know the basic steps, see the following articles: 

* Create/update subscription with filters.
* Set up persistence of Event Grid module on [linux](persist-state-linux.md) or [Windows](persist-state-windows.md)
* Follow [documentation](configure-client-auth.md) to configure client authentication
* Forward events to Azure Functions in the cloud by following this [tutorial](pub-sub-events-webhook-cloud.md)
