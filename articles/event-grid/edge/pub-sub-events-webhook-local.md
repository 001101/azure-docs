# Tutorial: Publish, subscribe to events locally

This article walks through all the steps needed to publish  and subscribe to events using Event Grid on IoT Edge.

Refer to [Event Grid Concepts](concepts.md) documentation to understand what an event grid topic, subscription is before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this tutorial, you will need:-

* **Azure Event Grid module on IoT Edge Device** - Follow the steps in described [here](deploy-event-grid-portal.md) on how to do that if not already done.

* **Azure Function subscriber module on the same IoT Edge Device** - Follow the steps in described [here](deploy-func-webhook-module-portal.md) on how to do that if not already done.

## Step 1: Create topic

As a publisher of an event, you need to create an event grid topic. Topic refers to an "endpoint" where publishers can then send events to.

1. Create topic.json with the below content. Refer to our [API documentation](api.md) for details about the payload.

   ```json
   {
       "name": "sampleTopic1",
       "properties" : {
          "inputschema": "customeventschema",
       },
   }
   ```

1. Run the following command to create the topic. HTTP Status Code of 200 OK should be returned.

    ```sh
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -g -d @topic.json https://<your-edge-device-public-ip-here>:4438/topics/sampleTopic1?api-version=2019-01-01-preview
    ```

## Step 2: Create event subscription

   Subscribers can register for events published to a topic. In order to receive any event, they will need to create an Event grid subscription on a topic of interest.

1. Create subscription.json with the below content. Refer to our [API documentation](api.md) for details about the payload.

   ```json
    {
      "properties": {
        "destination": {
          "endpointType": "WebHook",
          "properties": {
            "endpointUrl": "http://subscriber:80/api/subscriber"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

   >[!NOTE]
   > The **endpointType** specifies that the subscriber is a Webhook.  The **endpointUrl** specifies the URL at which the subscriber is listening for events. This URL corresponds to the Azure Function sample we deployed earlier.

2. Run the following command to create the subscription. HTTP Status Code of 200 OK should be returned.

    ```sh
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -g -d @subscription.json https://<your-edge-device-public-ip-here>:4438/topics/sampleTopic1/eventSubscriptions/sampleSubscription1?api-version=2019-01-01-preview
    ```

## Step 3: Publish event

1. Create event.json with the below content. Refer to our [API documentation](api.md) for details about the payload.

   ```json
   [{
       "data": {
            "make": "Ducati",
            "model": "Monster"
        }
    }]
    ```

1. Run the following command to publish event

    ```sh
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -g -d @event.json https://<your-edge-device-public-ip-here>:4438/topics/sampleTopic1/events?api-version=2019-01-01-preview
    ```

## Step 4: Verify event delivery

1. SSH or RDP into your IoT Edge VM
1. Check the subscriber logs

    On Windows,

    ```sh
    docker -H npipe:////./pipe/notedly_moby_engine container logs subscriber
    ```
    
   On Linux,

    ```sh
    sudo docker logs subscriber
    ```

    Sample Output: -

    ```json
    Received event data [
        {
            "data": {
                "make": "Ducati",
                "model": "Monster"
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an event grid topic, subscription, and published events. Now that you know the basic steps:

* Try publishing events with different schemas
* Try creating multiple subscriptions
* Try creating/updating subscription with filters
* Try creating/updating subscription with retry policy
* Try out client authentication from custom IoT modules
* Validate event grid module's server certificate, identity certificate from custom IoT modules
