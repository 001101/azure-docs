Event handlers refer to entities that subscribe to events. They are entities that can handle HTTP POST requests. Subscribers can be other IoT Edge modules, non-IoT Applications, Webhooks (for example, Azure Functions) as well as Event Grid in the cloud.

## Possible Event Handler(s)
* Other IoT Edge Modules (on the same device or different device)
* Webhook (same device, different device, cloud)
* EdgeHub (same device)
* Event Grid in the cloud

>[!IMPORTANT]
Refer to [Security and Authentication](security-authentication.md) documentation on the options available to securely expose Event Grid functionality to Non-IoT Edge Applications.
