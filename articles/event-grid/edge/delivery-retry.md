# Delivery and Retry

Event Grid provides durable delivery. It tries to deliver each message at least once for each matching subscription immediately. If a subscriber's endpoint doesn't acknowledge receipt of an event or if there is a failure, Event Grid retries delivery based on a fixed **retry schedule** and **retry policy**.  Currently Event Grid module delivers an event at a time to the subscriber. The payload is however an array with a single event.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>There is no persistence support for event data. This means redeploying Event Grid module will cause you to lose any events that were not yet delivered. Event persistence is under development and will be supported in a future release.

### Retry Schedule
Event Grid waits up to 60 seconds for a response after delivering a message. If the subscriber's endpoint does not ACK the response, then the message will be enqueued in one of our back off queues for subsequent retries.

There are two pre-configured back off queues that determine the schedule on which a retry will be attempted. They are:-

| Schedule | Description |
| ---------| ------------ |
| 1 minute | Messages that end up here are attempted every minute.
| 10 minutes | Messages that end up here are attempted every 10th minute.

#### How it works

1. Message arrives Event Grid module. Attempt is made to deliver it immediately.

1. If delivery fails, then the message is enqueued into 1-minute queue and retried after a minute.

1. If delivery continues to fail, then the message is enqueued into 10-minute queue and retried every 10 minutes.

1. Deliveries are attempted until successful or retry policy limits are reached.

### Retry policy Limits

There are two configurations that determine retry policy. They are:-

* Maximum number of attempts
* Event TTL

An event will be dropped if either of the limits of the retry policy is reached. The retry schedule itself was described above.

Configuration of these limits can be done either for all subscribers or per subscription basis. 
The below section describes each one is further detail.

#### Configuring defaults for all subscribers

There are two properties `brokers:defaultMaxDeliveryAttempts` and `broker:defaultEventTimeToLiveInSeconds` that can be configured as part of Event Grid deployment, which controls retry policy defaults for all subscribers.

| Property Name | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `broker:defaultMaxDeliveryAttempts` | Maximum number of attempts to deliver an event. Default 30.
| `broker:defaultEventTimeToLiveInSeconds` | Event TTL in seconds after which an event will be dropped if not delivered. Default **7200** seconds

##### Example - **Configure a maximum of three attempts and TTL of 30 minutes before dropping the events from being delivered**

```json
 {
        "Env": [
            "broker:defaultMaxDeliveryAttempts=3",
            "broker:defaultEventTimeToLiveInSeconds=1800",
        ],
        "HostConfig": {
            "PortBindings": {
                "4438/tcp": [
                    {
                        "HostPort": "4438"
                    }
                 ]
             }
        }
 }
 ```

#### Configuring defaults per subscriber

You can also specify retry policy limits on a per subscription basis.
Refer to our [API  documentation](api.md) on how to do configure defaults per subscriber. Subscription level defaults override the module level configurations.
