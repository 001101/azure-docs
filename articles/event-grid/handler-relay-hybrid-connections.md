# Relay Hybrid connection as an event handler for Azure Event Grid events
An event handler is the place where the event is sent. The handler takes some further action to process the event. Several Azure services are automatically configured to handle events and **Azure Relay** is one of them. Use Azure **Relay Hybrid Connections** to send events to applications that are within an enterprise network and don't have a publicly accessible endpoint.
