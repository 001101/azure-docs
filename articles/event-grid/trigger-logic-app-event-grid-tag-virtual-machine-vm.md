# Tag virtual machines by triggering logic app workflows with events from event grids

You can start a [logic app automated workflow](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md) 
when specific events happen in Azure resources or third-party resources. 
These resources can publish these events to an [Azure event grid](../event-grid/overview.md). 
And in turn, the event grid pushes those events to subscribers that have queues, 
webhooks, or [event hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs.md) as endpoints. 
As a subscriber, your logic app can wait for those events from an event grid 
before starting automated workflows to perform other tasks.

For example, here are some events that an event grid can send 
from publisher to subscriber:

* Create, read, update, or delete a resource
* New message in a queue
* New tweet

This tutorial shows how to create a logic app that starts running 
a series of steps when you create a virtual machine in Azure. 
On creation, the virtual machine publishes an event to an event grid, 
which pushes the event to your logic app. Your logic app passes 
data about the virtual machine to an Azure function 
that tags the virtual machine with a specified label.

## Requirements

To follow along, complete these tutorials first: 

* [Create a virtual machine with an event grid]()

  This tutorial shows how to create a virtual machine and an event grid 
  that publishes an event when you create a virtual machine. 
  The event grid then pushes that event to subscribers, like your logic app.

* [Create an Azure Functions app and function]() 

  This tutorial shows how to create an Azure function 
  that tags a virtual machine. Your logic app 
  calls this function as a step in its workflow. 

For this tutorial, you also need an email account with 
[any email provider that's supported by Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/apis-list.md), 
like Outlook.com, Office 365 Outlook, or Gmail.

## Create a logic app that responds to events from an event grid

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), from the main Azure menu, 
choose **New** > **Enterprise Integration** > **Logic App** as shown:

   ![Create logic app](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/azure-portal-create-logic-app.png)

2. Create your logic app:

   1. Provide a name for your logic app.

   2. Select the Azure subscription, resource group, 
   and location that you want to use for your logic app. 

   3. When you're ready, select **Pin to dashboard**, and choose **Create**.

      ![Provide logic app details](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/create-logic-app-for-event-grid.png)

      You've now created an Azure resource for your logic app. 
      After Azure deploys your logic app, the Logic Apps Designer 
      shows templates that you can use to get started.

      > [!NOTE] 
      > When you select **Pin to dashboard**, 
      > your logic app automatically opens in Logic Apps Designer. 
      > Otherwise, you can manually find and open your logic app.

3. Now choose a logic app template. 
For this tutorial, under **Templates**, choose **Blank Logic App**, 
so you can build your logic app from scratch.

   The Logic Apps Designer now shows available [*connectors*](../connectors/apis-list.md) 
   and [*triggers*](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts), 
   which you use to start your logic app. A trigger is an event that creates a 
   logic app instance and starts your logic app workflow. 
   Your logic app needs a trigger as the first item.

4. In the search box, enter "event grid" as your filter. 
Select this trigger: **Azure Event Grid - On a resource event**

   ![Select this trigger: "Azure Event Grid - On a resource event"](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-event-grid-trigger.png)

5. Now create an event subscription for your logic app 
to get events pushed by the publisher resource. 
Provide these event subscription details:

   * **Subscription**: Select the publisher resource's Azure subscription.

   * **Resource Type**: Select the publisher's resource type, 
   which is **Microsoft.EventGrid.topics** for this tutorial.

   * **Resource Name**: Select the publisher resource's name, 
   which is your previously created event grid for this tutorial.

   * For optional settings, choose **Show advanced options**.

      * **Subscription Name**: Provide a name for your event subscription.

      * **Prefix Filter**: Specify a prefix string as a filter, for example, 
      a path and parameter to the location for a specific resource.
      that you want to process. The default or empty string matches all values.

      * **Suffix Filter**: Specify a suffix string as a filter, 
      for example, a file name extension, if you want specific file types. 
      The default or an empty string matches all values.

      ![Provide details for event subscription](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-event-grid-trigger-details.png)

6. Save your logic app. On the designer toolbar, choose **Save**. 
   
When you save your logic app, the Event Grid trigger 
creates an event subscription between your logic app 
and the publisher resource. When the publisher pushes 
an event to the event grid, that event grid pushes 
the event to your logic app. After getting this event, 
your logic app creates an instance of itself and starts 
running the workflow that you define in these next steps.

## Call an Azure function from your logic app

Now you can add an [action](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps#logic-app-concepts) to perform tasks on data in your logic app workflow. 
For this example, add the Azure function that you previously created 
in [this tutorial]() for tagging your virtual machine.

1. In your logic app, under your Event Grid trigger, 
choose **New step** > **Add an action**.

   ![Choose "New step", "Add an action"](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-add-azure-function-app.png)

2. In the search box, enter "azure functions" as your filter. 
Select this action: **Azure Functions - Choose an Azure function**

   ![Select this action: "Azure Functions - Choose an Azure function"](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-azure-functions.png)

   Azure shows all the existing Azure function apps that 
   were created and associated with your Azure subscription.

3. In the search box, find your previously created Azure function app. 
Select your Azure function app: **Azure Functions - your-function-app-name**

   ![Select this function app: "Azure Functions - your-function-app-name"](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-azure-function-app.png)

   Azure now shows all the functions that are available in your selected function app.

4. Select your previously created function: **Azure Functions - your-function-name**

   ![Select this function: "Azure Functions - your-function-name"](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-azure-function-app-functions.png)

5. In **Request Body**, specify the data that you want to pass to your function.

   For this example: **{TBD}**

6. Save your logic app.

## Send email from your logic app

Now add an [*action*](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts) that sends email to notify the recipients when a virtual machine is created, tagged, 
and ready for use.

1. In your logic app, under your Azure function, 
choose **New step** > **Add an action**. 

2. In the search box, enter "email" as your filter. 
Based on your email provider, select an email connector. 

   For example, for Azure work or school accounts, 
   select the Office 365 Outlook connector. 
   For personal Microsoft accounts, 
   select the Outlook.com connector. 
   For Gmail accounts, select the Gmail connector.

3. Select the "send email" action for your connector. 
For example, if you're using Office 365 Outlook:

   ![Select "send email" action](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-send-email.png)

3. If you didn't previously create a connection for your email provider, 
sign in with the credentials for your email account when prompted for authentication.

4. Provide the details for the email action. 
When the **Dynamic content** list appears, 
you can select from fields availalbe in your logic app workflow.

   * In the **To** box, enter the recipient's email address. 
   For testing purposes, you can use your own email address.

   * In the **Subject** and **Body** boxes, 
   select the fields that you want to include in the email.

   For example, if you chose Office 365 Outlook, 
   here's what your email action might look like this example:

   ![Select outputs to include in email](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-send-email-details.png)

   > [!IMPORTANT] 
   > If you select a field that represents an array, 
   > the designer automatically adds a **For each** loop 
   > around the action that references the array. 
   > That way, your logic app performs that action on each array item.

   When you're done, your logic app looks like this example: 

   ![Finished logic app](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-completed.png)

5. Save and run your logic app.

   ![Save and run logic app](./media/trigger-logic-app-event-grid-tag-virtual-machine/logic-app-event-grid-save-run.png)
