# Event handlers in Azure Event Grid

An event handler is the place where the event is sent. The handler takes some further action to process the event. Several Azure services are automatically configured to handle events. You can also use any WebHook for handling events. The WebHook doesn't need to be hosted in Azure to handle events. Event Grid only supports HTTPS WebHook endpoints.

Here are the supported event handlers: 

- [WebHooks](handler-webhooks.md). Azure Automation runbooks are supported via webhooks. 
- [Azure functions](handler-functions.md)
- [Event hubs](handler-event-hubs.md)
- [Logic Apps](handler-logic-apps.md)
- [Relay hybrid connections](handler-relay-hybrid-connections.md)
- [Service Bus queues and topics](handler-service-bus.md)
- [Storage queues](handler-storage-queues.md)
