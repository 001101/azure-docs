# Configure IP firewall for Event Grid topics or domains
By default, topic and domain are accessible from internet as long as the request comes with valid authentication and authorization. With IP firewall, you can restrict it further to only a set of IP addresses or IP address ranges in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. Publishers originating from any other IP address will be rejected and will receive a 403 (Forbidden) response. 

This article describes how to configure IP firewall settings for Event Grid topics or domains.

## Use Azure portal

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Navigate to your Event Grid topic or domain, and switch to the **Networking** tab.

2. Select one of the following options. 
    
    - Select **All IP addresses** if you want the Event Grid topic or domain to be accessed from all IP addresses. This is the default value. 
    - Select the **Selected IP addresses and private endpoints** option if you want the Event Grid to be accessed from only specified IP addresses and private endpoints. Then, enter the range of IP addresses that can access the Event Grid topic or domain. 
3. Select **Save** on the toolbar.
