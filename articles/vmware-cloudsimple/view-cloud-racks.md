# View the list of cloud racks
Cloud racks are the building blocks of your Private Clouds. Each cloud rack provides a unit of capacity. When creating or expanding a Private Cloud, CloudSimple automatically configures cloud racks based on your selections. You cannot modify your cloud rack configuration. 

To view the list of cloud racks, [access the CloudSimple portal](access-cloudsimple-portal), open the **Resources** page, select a Private Cloud, and click **Cloud Racks**.
