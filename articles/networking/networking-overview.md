- [**Application protection services**](#protect) Protect your applications using DDoS protection, Firewall, Network Security Groups, Web Application Firewall, and Virtual Network Endpoints.
- [**Application delivery services**](#deliver) Deliver applications in the Azure network using CDN, Front Door, Traffic Manager, Application Gateway, Load Balancer.
- [**Network monitoring**](#monitor) â€“ Monitor your network resources in Azure using Network Watcher, ExpressRoute Monitor, Azure Monitor, Virtual Network TAP.

### <a name="waf"></a>Web Application Firewall

Web application firewall (WAF) provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. For more information about Web Application Firewall, see [WAF overview](../frontdoor/waf-overview.md)

![WAF overview](../frontdoor/media/waf-overview/web-application-firewall-overview2.png)

### <a name="firewall"></a>Azure Firewall
Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. For more information about Azure Firewall, see the [Azure Firewall documentation](../firewall/overview.md).

![Firewall overview](../firewall/media/overview/firewall-overview.png)

### <a name="nsg"></a>Network security groups
You can filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network with a network security group. For more information, see [Security Overview](../virtual-network/security-overview.md).

### <a name="serviceendpoints"></a>Service endpoints
Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your VNet to the Azure services, over a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your VNet to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network. For more information, see [Virtual network service endpoints](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md).
