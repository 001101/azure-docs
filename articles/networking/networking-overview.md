### <a name="vnet"></a>Virtual network

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. Azure resource, such as virtual machines, can use VNet to securely communicate between each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. For more information, see [What is Azure Virtual Network?](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

### <a name="expressroute"></a>ExpressRoute
ExpressRoute enables you to extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365. For more information, see [What is ExpressRoute?](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md)

### <a name="vpngateway"></a>VPN Gateway
VPN Gateway helps you create encrypted cross-premises connections to your virtual network from on-premises locations, or create encrypted connections between VNets. For more information, see [VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md).

### <a name="virtualwan"></a>Virtual WAN
Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that provides optimized and automated branch connectivity to, and through, Azure. Azure regions serve as hubs that you can choose to connect your branches to. You can leverage the Azure backbone to also connect branches and enjoy branch-to-VNet connectivity. 
Azure Virtual WAN brings together many Azure cloud connectivity services such as site-to-site VPN (generally available), ExpressRoute (Preview), point-to-site user VPN (Preview) into a single operational interface. Connectivity to Azure VNets is established by using virtual network connections. For more information, see [What is Azure virtual WAN?](..//virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about.md).
