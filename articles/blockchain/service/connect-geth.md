# Quickstart: Use geth to connect to a consortium network

`geth` is a command-line interface you can use to connect to an Azure Blockchain Service node.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Install [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth)
* [Create an Azure Blockchain member](create-member-portal.md)

## Get node details

You can find the username and endpoint address and change your password in Node Security in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to one of your Azure Blockchain managed ledger member transaction nodes.
1. Select **Connection security > Access keys**.
1. Copy the endpoint address from **Access key > HTTPS**. You need the address for the next section.

## Connect to geth

Using a command prompt, run:

```
geth attach <Azure Blockchain Service endpoint URL>
```
