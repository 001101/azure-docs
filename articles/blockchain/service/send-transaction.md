# Tutorial: Use smart contracts on Azure Blockchain Service

In this tutorial, you'll use the Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum to create and deploy a smart contract then execute a smart contract function via a transaction on a consortium network.

You use Azure Blockchain Development Kit to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Connect to Azure Blockchain Service consortium member
> * Create a smart contract
> * Deploy a smart contract
> * Execute a smart contract function via a transaction

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Complete [Quickstart: Create a blockchain member using the Azure portal](create-member.md) or [Quickstart: Create an Azure Blockchain Service blockchain member using Azure CLI](create-member-cli.md)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* [Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzBlockchain.azure-blockchain)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/). Add python.exe to your path. Python in your path is required for Azure Blockchain Development Kit.
* [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)
* [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli)

### Verify Azure Blockchain Development Kit environment

Azure Blockchain Development Kit verifies your development environment prerequisites have been met. To verify your development environment:

From the VS Code command palette, choose **Azure Blockchain: Show Welcome Page**.

Azure Blockchain Development Kit runs a validation script that takes about a minute to complete. You can view the output by selecting **Terminal > New Terminal**. In the terminal menu bar, select the **Output** tab and **Azure Blockchain** in the dropdown. Successful validation looks like the following image:

 If you are missing a required tool, a new tab named **Azure Blockchain Development Kit - Preview** lists the required apps to install and links to download the tools.

## Connect to consortium member

You can connect to consortium members using the Azure Blockchain Development Kit VS Code extension. Once connected to a consortium, you can compile, build, and deploy smart contracts to an Azure Blockchain Service consortium member.

If you don't have access to an Azure Blockchain Service consortium member, complete the prerequisite [Quickstart: Create a blockchain member using the Azure portal](create-member.md) or [Quickstart: Create an Azure Blockchain Service blockchain member using Azure CLI](create-member-cli.md).

1. In the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) explorer pane, expand the **Azure Blockchain** extension.
1. Select **Connect to Consortium**.

   ![Connect to consortium](./media/send-transaction/connect-consortium.png)

    If prompted for Azure authentication, follow the prompts to authenticate using a browser.
1. Choose **Connect to Azure Blockchain Service consortium** in the command palette dropdown.
1. Choose the subscription and resource group associated with your Azure Blockchain Service consortium member.
1. Choose your consortium from the list.

The consortium and blockchain members are listed in the Visual Studio explorer side bar.

## Create a smart contract

The Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum uses project templates and Truffle tools to help scaffold, build, and deploy contracts.

1. From the VS Code command palette, choose **Azure Blockchain: New Solidity Project**.
1. Choose **Create basic project**.
1. Create a new folder named `HelloBlockchain` and **Select new project path**.

The Azure Blockchain Development Kit creates and initializes a new Solidity project for you. The basic project includes a sample **HelloBlockchain** smart contract and all the necessary files to build and deploy to your consortium member in Azure Blockchain Service. It may take several minutes for the project to be created. You can monitor the progress in VS Code's terminal panel by selecting the output for Azure Blockchain.

The project structure looks like the following example:

   ![Solidity project](./media/send-transaction/solidity-project.png)

## Build smart contract

Smart contracts are located in the project's **contracts** directory. You need to compile smart contracts before you deploy them to the blockchain. Use the **Build Contracts** command to compile all the smart contracts in your project.

1. In the VS Code explorer sidebar, expand the **contracts** folder in your project.
1. Right-click **HelloBlockchain.sol** and choose **Build Contracts** from the menu.

    ![Build contracts](./media/send-transaction/build-contracts.png)

Azure Blockchain Development Kit uses Truffle to compile the smart contracts.

![Compile output](./media/send-transaction/compile-output.png)

## Deploy smart contract

Truffle uses migration scripts to deploy your contracts to an Ethereum network. Migrations are JavaScript files located in the project's **migrations** directory.

1. To deploy your smart contract, right-click **HelloBlockchain.sol** and choose **Deploy Contracts** from the menu.
1. Choose your Azure Blockchain consortium network under **From truffle-config.js**. The consortium network was added to the project's Truffle configuration file when you created the project.
1. Choose **Generate mnemonic**. Choose a filename and save the mnemonic file in the project folder. For example, `myblockchainmember.env`. The mnemonic file is used to generate an Ethereum private key for your blockchain member.

Azure Blockchain Development Kit uses Truffle to execute the migration script to deploy the contracts to the consortium blockchain.

## Execute contract function

The **HelloBlockchain** contract's **SendRequest** function changes the **RequestMessage** state variable. Changing the state of a blockchain network is done via a transaction. You can create a script to execute the **SendRequest** function via a transaction.

1. Create a new file and add the following code.

    ```javascript
    var HelloBlockchain = artifacts.require("HelloBlockchain");
        
    module.exports = function(done) {
      console.log("Getting the deployed version of the HelloBlockchain smart contract")
      HelloBlockchain.deployed().then(function(instance) {
        console.log("Calling SendRequest function");
        return instance.SendRequest("Hello, blockchain!");
      }).then(function(result) {
        console.log("Transaction hash: ", result.tx);
        console.log("Request complete");
        done();
      }).catch(function(e) {
        console.log(e);
        done();
      });
    };
    ```

1. Name the file `sendrequest.js` and save it at the root of your project.
1. When Azure Blockchain Development Kit creates a project, the Truffle configuration file is generated with your consortium network endpoint details. Open **truffle-config.js** in your project. The configuration file lists two networks: one named development and one with the same name as the consortium.
1. In VS Code's terminal pane, use Truffle to execute the script on your consortium network. In the terminal pane menu bar, select the **Terminal** tab and **PowerShell** in the dropdown.

    ```bash
    truffle exec sendrequest.js --network <consortium network>
    ```

    Replace \<consortium network\> with the name of the consortium network defined in the **truffle-config.js**.

Truffle executes the script on your consortium network.

![Execute script](./media/send-transaction/execute-transaction.png)

When you execute a contract's function via a transaction, the transaction isn't processed until a block is created. Functions meant to be executed via a transaction return a transaction ID instead of a return value.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resources by deleting the `myResourceGroup` resource group you created by the Azure Blockchain Service.

To delete the resource group:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Resource group** in the left navigation pane and select the resource group you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete resource group**. Verify deletion by entering the resource group name and select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a sample Solidity project using Azure Blockchain Development Kit. You built and deployed a smart contract then called a function via a transaction on a blockchain consortium network hosted on Azure Blockchain Service.
