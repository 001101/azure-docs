# Tutorial: Send a transaction using Azure Blockchain Service

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add transaction nodes
> * Use Truffle to deploy a smart contract
> * Send a transaction
> * Validate transaction privacy

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

* [Create a blockchain member using Azure portal](create-member-portal.md)
* [Use Truffle to connect to a consortium network](connect-truffle.md)
* Install VS Code
* Install web3

## Create transaction nodes

By default, you have one transaction node. We're going to add two more for some reason.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
1. Navigate to your transaction node
1. Select Add to add additional nodes. Name the new nodes b, c.

## Create Truffle project

1. Create a new project folder called c:\nodeA
1. In Visual Studio Code, select File > Open folder > C:\nodeA to open the project.
1. 
## Deploy a smart contract

After setting up MetaMask, we can use Injected Web3 in Remix. [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online solidity IDE that enables you to write and debug smart contracts.

Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), write the solidity code on the left pane. In this article, we are using a simple contract: `sample.sol`

``` solidity
pragma solidity^0.4.24;

contract sample{
    uint balance;
    
    constructor() public{
        balance = 0;
    }
    
    function add(uint _num) public {
        balance += _num;
    }
    
    function get() public view returns (uint){
        return balance;
    }
}
```

1. Copy the smart contract in the left pane and select **Start to compile**.
1. Go to the **Run** tab, select **Injected Web3**, and select **deploy**. The account is set in MetaMask.
1. Edit the **gas price** to 0, and select **confirm**.
1. If remix shows a deployed contract with function buttons, the deployment is successful.

## Send transactions

1. To call the add function, enter the number you wish to add to the balance, and select add.
1. Edit the gas price to 0 and select confirm.
1. Click the get button, it should return 100, which is the number we just added.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resources by deleting the `myresourcegroup` resource group you created by the Azure Blockchain Service.

To delete the resource group:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Resource group** in the left navigation pane and select the resource group you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete resource group**. Verify deletion by entering the resource group name and select **Delete**.
