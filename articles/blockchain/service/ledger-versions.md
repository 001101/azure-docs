# Supported Azure Blockchain Service ledger versions

Azure Blockchain Service uses the Ethereum-based [Quorum](https://www.goquorum.com/developers) ledger designed for the processing of private transactions within a group of known participants, identified as a consortium in Azure Blockchain Service.

Currently, Azure Blockchain Service supports [Quorum version 2.6.0](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/releases/tag/v2.6.0) and [Tessera transaction manager](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/tessera).

## Managing updates and upgrades

Versioning in Quorum is done through a major, minor, and patch releases. For example, if the Quorum version is 2.0.1, release type would be categorized as follows:

|Major | Minor  | Patch  |
| :--- | :----- | :----- |
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 

Azure Blockchain Service automatically updates patch releases of Quorum to existing running members within 30 days of being made available from Quorum.

## Check Quorum ledger version on your Azure Blockchain Service member resource
To check the Quorum version on your Azure Blockchain Service member, you can follow the below steps
	
  a) Do a geth attach to your node,  
	
     geth attach https://vipurtestwe1.blockchain.azure.com:3200/APIKEY
	
  As soon as your node is connected you can check geth and Quorum version in message similar to below, 
  
	  instance: Geth/v1.9.7-stable-9339be03(quorum-v2.6.0)/linux-amd64/go1.13.12
  
  b) If you have enabled logs you can verify this by looking at following logs. To enable logs, refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/service/monitor-azure-blockchain-service#diagnostic-settings)
	
	   {"NodeName":"transaction-node","Message":"INFO [06-22|05:31:45.156] Starting peer-to-peer node instance=Geth/v1.9.7-stable-9339be03(quorum-v2.6.0)/linux-amd64/go1.13.12\n"}
	 
	   {"NodeName":"transaction-node","Message":"[*] Starting Quorum node with QUORUM_VERSION=2.6.0, TESSERA_VERSION=0.10.5 and PRIVATE_CONFIG=/working-dir/c/tm.ipc\n"}
 

## Check genesis file content on your Azure Blockchain Service member resource 
To check genesis file content of your blockchain node, you can run the below admin API either on geth console or through web library 
	
	admin.nodeInfo.protocols 


## Availability of new ledger versions

Azure Blockchain Service provides the latest major and minor versions of the Quorum ledger within 60 days of being available from the Quorum manufacturer. A maximum of four minor releases are provided for consortia to choose from when provisioning a new member and consortium. Upgrading from to a major or minor release is currently not supported. For example, if you are running version 2.x, an upgrade to version 3.x is currently not supported. Similarly, if you are running version 2.2, an upgrade to version 2.3 is currently not supported.
