# VNet peering and Azure Bastion

Azure Bastion supports VNet peering. When VNet peering is configured, you don't have to deploy Azure Bastion in each peered VNet. This means if you have an Azure Bastion host configured in one virtual network (VNet), it can be leveraged to connect to VMs deployed in a peered VNet without deploying an additional Bastion host.

Azure Bastion supports the following types of peering:

* **Virtual network peering:** Connect virtual networks within the same Azure region.
* **Global virtual network peering:** Connecting virtual networks across Azure regions.

## Architecture

When VNet peering support is configured, Azure Bastion can be deployed in hub-and-spoke or full-mesh topologies. Azure Bastion deployment is per virtual network, not per subscription/account or virtual machine.

Once you provision the Azure Bastion service in your virtual network, the RDP/SSH experience is available to all your VMs in the same VNet, as well as peered VNets. Because VNet peering is supported, you can consolidate Bastion deployment to single VNet and still reach VMs deployed in a peered VNet. This centralizes the overall deployment.

This figure shows the architecture of an Azure Bastion deployment in a hub-and-spoke model. In this diagram you can see the following configuration:

* The Bastion host is deployed in the centralized Hub virtual network.
* Centralized Network Security Group (NSG) is deployed.
* A public IP is not required on the Azure VM.

Steps:

1. The user connects to the Azure portal using any HTML5 browser.
1. The user selects the virtual machine to connect to.
1. Azure Bastion is seamlessly detected across the peered VNet.
1. With a single click, the RDP/SSH session opens in the browser.
