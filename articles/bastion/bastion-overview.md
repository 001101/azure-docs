# What is Azure Bastion? (preview)

Azure Bastion lets you to securely and seamlessly RDP & SSH directly to your VMs in an Azure virtual network without using a VM public IP. You connect to the VM directly from the Azure portal, without the need of any additional client, agent, or any piece of software.

> This public preview is provided without a service level agreement and should not be used for production workloads. Certain features may not be supported, may have constrained capabilities, or may not be available in all Azure locations. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for details.

## How does it work?

Once you provision an Azure Bastion service in your virtual network, the seamless RDP/SSH experience is available to all your VMs in the same virtual network. The deployment is per virtual network, not per subscription/account or virtual machine.

You do not need to onboard in order to participate in the public preview. Use the steps in [this article](bastion-create-host-portal.md) to create a new Azure Bastion resource. Currently, when accessing and using this service, you must use the [Azure portal - preview](https://aka.ms/BastionHost), rather than the regular Azure portal.

The public preview is limited to the following Azure public regions:
