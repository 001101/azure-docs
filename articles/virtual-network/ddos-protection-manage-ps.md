# Manage DDoS Protection using Azure PowerShell

This article shows you how to use Azure PowerShell to enable DDoS Protection, disable DDoS Protection, and use telemetry to mitigate an attack. 

Before running any of the commands in this article, log in to Azure.

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

## Enable DDoS Protection

This section details steps to enable DDoS Protection on supported protected resource types. Before following the steps below, make sure you have completed the steps in the [FAQ](ddos-protection-faq.md).

### Create a new virtual network and enable DDoS Protection

To create a virtual network with DDoS Protection enabled, run the following example:

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name <ResourceGroupName> -Location westcentralus 
$frontendSubnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name <frontendSubnet> -AddressPrefix "10.0.1.0/24" 
$backendSubnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name <backendSubnet> -AddressPrefix "10.0.2.0/24" 
New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name <MyVirtualNetwork> -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName>  -Location westcentralus  -AddressPrefix "10.0.0.0/16" -Subnet $frontendSubnet,$backendSubnet -DnsServer 10.0.1.5,10.0.1.6 -EnableDDoSProtection
```

This example creates a virtual network with two subnets and two DNS servers. The effect of specifying the DNS servers on the virtual network is that the NICs/VMs that are deployed into this virtual network inherit these DNS servers as defaults. DDoS protection is enabled for all the protected resources in the virtual network.

### Enable DDoS Protection on an existing virtual network

To enable DDoS Protection on an existing virtual network, run the following example:

```powershell
$vnetProps = (Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceType "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks" -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -ResourceName <ResourceName>).Properties
$vnetProps.enableDdosProtection = $true
Set-AzureRmResource -PropertyObject $vnetProps -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroupName" -ResourceName "ResourceName" -ResourceType Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks
```

## Disable DDoS Protection on a virtual network

To disable DDoS protection on a virtual network, run the following example:

```powershell
$vnetProps = (Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceType "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks" -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -ResourceName <ResourceName>).Properties
$vnetProps.enableDdosProtection = $false
Set-AzureRmResource -PropertyObject $vnetProps -ResourceGroupName <RessourceGroupName> -ResourceName <ResourceName> -ResourceType "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks"
```

## Review the DDoS protection status of virtual networks 

```powershell
$vnetProps = (Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceType "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks" -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -ResourceName <ResourceName>).Properties
$vnetProps
```

## Use DDoS Protection telemetry

Learn how to use the Azure DDoS Protection service telemetry while under an attack using the Azure Monitor. 

Telemetry for an attack is provided through Azure Monitor in real time. The telemetry is available only for the duration that a public IP address is under mitigation. You will not see telemetry before or after an attack is mitigated.

### Configure alerts on DDoS Protection metrics

Leveraging the Azure Monitor alert configuration, you can select any of the available DDoS Protection metrics to alert when there’s an active mitigation during an attack.

#### Configure email alert rules via Azure PowerShell

1. Get a list of the subscriptions you have available. Verify that you are working with the right subscription. If not, set it to the right one using the output from Get-AzureRmSubscription. 

    ```powershell
	Get-AzureRmSubscription 
    Get-AzureRmContext 
    Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <subscriptionid>
	```

2. To list existing rules on a resource group, use the following command: 

    ```powershell
	Get-AzureRmAlertRule -ResourceGroup <myresourcegroup> -DetailedOutput
	```

3. To create a rule, you need to have several important pieces of information first. 

    - The Resource ID for the resource you want to set an alert for.
	- The metric definitions available for that resource. One way to get the Resource ID is to use the Azure portal. Assuming the resource is already created, select it in the Azure portal. Then in the next page, select *Properties* under the *Settings* section. The **RESOURCE ID** is a field in the next page. Another way is to use the [Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com/). An example Resource ID for a public IP is: `/subscriptions/dededede-7aa0-407d-a6fb-eb20c8bd1192/resourceGroups/myresourcegroupname/providers/Microsoft.Network/ publicIPAddresses/mypublicip`

    The following example sets up an alert on a Public IP associated to a virtual network. The metric to create an alert on is **Under DDoS attack or not**. This is a boolean value 1 or 0. A **1** means you are under attack. A **0** means you are not under attack. The alert is created when you are under the attack within last 5 minutes.

	To create a webhook or send email when an alert is created, first create the email and/or webhooks. Then immediately create the rule afterwards with the -Actions tag and as shown in the following example. You cannot associate webhook or emails with already created rules via PowerShell.

	```powershell
	$actionEmail = New-AzureRmAlertRuleEmail -CustomEmail myname@company.com 
    Add-AzureRmMetricAlertRule -Name <myMetricRuleWithEmail> -Location "West Central US" -ResourceGroup <myresourcegroup> -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/dededede-7aa0-407d-a6fb-eb20c8bd1192/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/mypublicip -MetricName "IfUnderDDoSAttack" -Operator GreaterThan -Threshold 0 -WindowSize 00:05:00 -TimeAggregationOperator Total -Actions $actionEmail-Description "Under DDoS Attack" 
    ```

4. To verify that your alerts have been created properly by looking at the individual rules.

    ```powershell
	Get-AzureRmAlertRule -Name myMetricRuleWithEmail -ResourceGroup myresourcegroup -DetailedOutput 
    Get-AzureRmAlertRule -Name myLogAlertRule -ResourceGroup myresourcegroup -DetailedOutput
	```

You can also learn more about [configuring webhooks](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-webhooks-alerts.md) and [logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md) for creating alerts.

## Configure logging on DDoS Protection metrics

To set up a logging alert, navigate to **Monitor -> Diagnostic Settings** page and then filter by Resource Group and Resource Type of Public IP Addresses.  If you don’t see the Public IP resource available in the list. Select the Public IP Resource you want to receive logs for in the drop-down list and then click **Turn on diagnostics to collect the following data**.

There are three options available for logging:

- **Archive to a storage account** – writes logs to a storage account.
- **Stream to an event hub** –  Allows a log receiver to pick up logs via an event hub. This enables integration with Splunk or other SIEM systems.
- **Send to Log Analytics** – Writes logs to Azure OMS Log Analytics service.

Refer to the [PowerShell quick start samples](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-powershell-samples.md) to help you access & configure Azure diagnostic logging via PowerShell.
