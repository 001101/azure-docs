# Private IP addresses
Private IP addresses allow Azure resources to communicate with other resources in a [virtual network](virtual-networks-overview.md) or an on-premises network through a VPN gateway or ExpressRoute circuit, without using an Internet-reachable IP address.

In the Azure Resource Manager deployment model, a private IP address is associated to the following types of Azure resources:

* Virtual machine network interfaces
* Internal load balancers (ILBs)
* Application gateways

## Allocation method

A private IP address is allocated from the address range of the virtual network subnet a resource is deployed in. Azure reserves the first four addresses in each subnet address range, so the addresses cannot be assigned to resources. For example, if the subnet's address range is 10.0.0.0/16, addresses 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.3 and 10.0.255.255 cannot be assigned to resources. IP addresses within the subnet's address range can only be assigned to one resource at a time. 

There are two methods in which a private IP address is allocated:

- **Dynamic**: Azure assigns the next available unassigned or unreserved IP address in the subnet's address range. For example, Azure assigns 10.0.0.10 to a new resource, if addresses 10.0.0.4-10.0.0.9 are already assigned to other resources. Dynamic is the default allocation method. Once assigned, dynamic IP addresses are only released if a network interface is deleted, assigned to a different subnet within the same virtual network, or the allocation method is changed to static, and a different IP address is specified. By default, Azure assigns the previous dynamically assigned address as the static address when you change the allocation method from dynamic to static.
- **Static**: You select and assign any unassigned or unreserved IP address in the subnet's address range. For example, if a subnet's address range is 10.0.0.0/16 and addresses 10.0.0.4-10.0.0.9 are already assigned to other resources, you can assign any address between 10.0.0.10 - 10.0.255.254. Static addresses are only released if a network interface is deleted. If you change the allocation method to dynamic, Azure dynamically assigns the previously assigned static IP address as the dynamic address, even if the address isn't the next available address in the subnet's address range. The address also changes if the network interface is assigned to a different subnet within the same virtual network, but to assign the network interface to a different subnet, you must first change the allocation method from static to dynamic. Once you've assigned the network interface to a different subnet, you can change the allocation method back to static, and assign an IP address from the new subnet's address range.

## Virtual machines

One or more private IP addresses are assigned to one or more **network interfaces** of a [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) virtual machine. You can specify the allocation method as either dynamic or static for each private IP address.

### Internal DNS hostname resolution (for virtual machines)

All Azure virtual machines are configured with [Azure-managed DNS servers](virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md#azure-provided-name-resolution) by default, unless you explicitly configure custom DNS servers. These DNS servers provide internal name resolution for virtual machines that reside within the same virtual network.

When you create a virtual machine, a mapping for the hostname to its private IP address is added to the Azure-managed DNS servers. If a virtual machine has multiple network interfaces, or multiple IP configurations for a network interface the hostname is mapped to the private IP address of the primary IP configuration of the primary network interface.

Virtual machines configured with Azure-managed DNS servers are able to resolve the hostnames of all virtual machines within the same virtual network to their private IP addresses. To resolve host names of virtual machines in connected virtual networks, you must use a custom DNS server.

## Internal load balancers (ILB) & Application gateways

You can assign a private IP address to the **front-end** configuration of an [Azure Internal Load Balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-internal-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) (ILB) or an [Azure Application Gateway](../application-gateway/application-gateway-introduction.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). This private IP address serves as an internal endpoint, accessible only to the resources within its virtual network and the remote networks connected to the virtual network. You can assign either a dynamic or static private IP address to the front-end configuration.

## At-a-glance
The following table shows the specific property through which a private IP address can be associated to a top-level resource, and the possible allocation methods (dynamic or static) that can be used.

| Top-level resource | IP address association | Dynamic | Static |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Virtual machine |Network interface |Yes |Yes |
| Load balancer |Front-end configuration |Yes |Yes |
| Application gateway |Front-end configuration |Yes |Yes |

## Limits
The limits imposed on IP addressing are indicated in the full set of [limits for networking](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#networking-limits) in Azure. The limits are per region and per subscription. You can [contact support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to increase the default limits up to the maximum limits based on your business needs.
