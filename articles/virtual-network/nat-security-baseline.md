# Azure security baseline for Virtual Network NAT

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Virtual Network NAT. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Virtual Network NAT. **Controls** not applicable to Virtual Network NAT have been excluded.

 
To see how Virtual Network NAT completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Virtual Network NAT security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33769.).

**Guidance**: Virtual Network NAT doesn't support controlling outbound traffic with network security groups (NSG).  Inbound traffic is only allowed in response to an outbound originated flow.

However, network security group (NSG) flow logs can be used with NAT gateway resources to monitor outbound originated traffic.

Use Azure Security Center and follow the network protection recommendations to help secure your Azure network resources. Enable network security group flow logs and send the logs to an Azure Storage account for auditing. You can also send the flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic patterns in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity, identify hot spots and security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33776.).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for subnets configured with NAT gateway resources using built-in or custom Azure Policy definitions and assignments.

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33780.).

**Guidance**: Ingest logs related to Virtual Network NAT via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage accounts for long term and archival storage.

Alternatively, you can enable and on-board this data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

- [How to collect platform logs and metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md) 

- [How to get started with Azure Monitor and third-party SIEM integration](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/use-azure-monitor-to-integrate-with-siem-tools/)

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33781.).

**Guidance**: Activity logs, which are automatically available, contain all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your NAT gateway resources except read operations (GET). Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

- [How to collect platform logs and metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md) 

- [Understand logging and different log types in Azure](../azure-monitor/platform/platform-logs-overview.md) 

Virtual Network NAT currently does not produce any additional diagnostic logs which are configurable by customers.
