# Azure security baseline for Virtual Network NAT

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Virtual Network NAT. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Virtual Network NAT. **Controls** not applicable to Virtual Network NAT have been excluded.

 
To see how Virtual Network NAT completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Virtual Network NAT security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33768.).

**Guidance**: Virtual Network NAT provides outbound originated connectivity for a virtual network. When a NAT gateway resource is assigned to a subnet, the default route from the subnet is mapped to the NAT gateway resource without customer action. Inbound traffic is only allowed in response to an outbound originated flow.  Network security groups (NSG) can be used for resources on a subnet using a NAT gateway, but don't apply to outbound originated traffic through NAT gateway resources.  NSG flow logs can be used to monitor traffic traversing a NAT gateway resource.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33769.).

**Guidance**: Virtual Network NAT doesn't support controlling outbound traffic with network security groups (NSG).  Inbound traffic is only allowed in response to an outbound originated flow.

However, network security group (NSG) flow logs can be used with NAT gateway resources to monitor outbound originated traffic.

Use Azure Security Center and follow the network protection recommendations to help secure your Azure network resources. Enable network security group flow logs and send the logs to an Azure Storage account for auditing. You can also send the flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic patterns in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity, identify hot spots and security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.
