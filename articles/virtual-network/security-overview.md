# Network security

You can limit network traffic to resources in a virtual network using a network security group. A network security group contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol. 

## Network security groups

Each network interface has zero, or one, associated network security group. Each network interface exists in a [virtual network](virtual-networks-overview) subnet. A subnet can also have zero, or one, associated network security group. 

When applied to a subnet, security rules are applied to all resources in the subnet. In addition to network interfaces, you may have instances of other Azure services such as HDInsight, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Application Service Environments deployed in the subnet.

How network security groups are applied when a network security group is associated to both a network interface, and the subnet the network interface is in, is as follows:

- **Inbound traffic**: The network security group associated to the subnet the network interface is in is evaluated first. Any traffic allowed through the network security group associated to the subnet is then evaluated by the network security group associated to the network interface. For example, you might require inbound access to a virtual machine over port 80 from the Internet. If you associate a network security group to both the network interface, and the subnet the network interface is in, the network security group associated to the subnet and the network interface must allow port 80. If you only allowed port 80 through the network security group associated to the subnet or the network interface the subnet is in, communication fails due to default security rules. See [default security rules](#default-security-rules) for details. If you only applied a network security group to either the subnet or the network interface, and the network security group contained a rule that allowed inbound port 80 traffic, for example, the communication succeeds. 
- **Outbound traffic**: The network security group associated to the network interface is evaluated first. Any traffic allowed through the network security group associated to the network interface is then evaluated by the network security group associated to the subnet.

You may not always be aware when network security groups are applied to both a network interface and a subnet. You can easily view the aggregate rules applied to a network interface by viewing the [effective security rules](virtual-network-manage-nsg-arm-portal.md) for a network interface. You can also use the [IP flow verify](../network-watcher/network-watcher-check-ip-flow-verify-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) capability in Azure Network Watcher to determine whether communication is allowed to or from a network interface. The tool tells you whether communication is allowed, and which network security rule allows or denies traffic.
 
> [!NOTE]
> Network security groups are associated to subnets or to virtual machines and cloud services deployed the classic deployment model, rather than to network interfaces in the Resource Manager deployment model. To learn more about Azure deployment models, see [Understand Azure deployment models](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

The same network security group can be applied to as many individual network interfaces and subnets as you choose.

## Security rules

A network security group contains zero, or as many rules as desired, within Azure subscription [limits](azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits). Each rule specifies the following properties:

|Property  |Explanation  |
|---------|---------|
|Name|A unique name within the network security group.|
|Priority | A number between 100 and 4096. Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers, because lower numbers have higher priority. Once traffic matches a rule, processing stops. As a result, any rules that exist with lower priorities (higher numbers) that have the same attributes as rules with higher priorities are not processed.|
|Source (for inbound rules) or destination (for outbound rules)| Any, or an individual IP address, CIDR block (example 10.0.0.0/24, for example), service tag, or application security group. Learn more about [service tags](#service-tag) and [application security groups](#application-security-group). Specifying a range, a service tag, or application security group, enables you to create fewer security rules. The ability to specify multiple individual IP addresses and ranges (you cannot specify multiple service tags or application groups) is in preview release. Features in preview do not have the same level of availability or reliability as features in general release. You can specify multiple individual IP addresses and ranges in network security groups in only the following Azure [regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions): East US, West US, West US 2, Australia East, Australia Southeast, and UK South. @@@ This capability applies only to ARM NSGs, not classic, correct?  If so, I'll add a note about that.@@@|
|Protocol     | TCP, UDP, or Any, which includes TCP, UDP, and ICMP. You cannot specify ICMP alone, so if you require ICMP, you must use Any. |
|Direction| Whether the rule applies to inbound, or outbound traffic.|
|Port range     |You can specify an individual or range of ports. For example, you could specify 80 or 10000-10005. Specifying ranges enables you to create fewer security rules. The ability to specify multiple ports and ranges is in preview release. Features in preview do not have the same level of availability or reliability as features in general release. You can specify multiple individual ports and ranges in network security groups in only the following Azure [regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions): East US, West US, West US 2, Australia East, Australia Southeast, and UK South. @@@This capability applies only to ARM NSGs, not classic, correct?  If so, I'll add a note about that.@@@     |
|Action     | Allow or deny        |

**Considerations**

- **Virtual IP of the host node**: Basic infrastructure services such as DHCP, DNS, and health monitoring are provided through the virtualized host IP address 168.63.129.16. This public IP address belongs to Microsoft and is the only virtualized IP address used in all regions for this purpose. This IP address maps to the physical IP address of the server machine (host node) hosting the VM. The host node acts as the DHCP relay, the DNS recursive resolver, and the probe source for the load balancer health probe and the machine health probe. Communication to this IP address is not an attack. If you block traffic to or from this IP address, a virtual machine may not function properly.
- **Licensing (Key Management Service)**: Windows images running in VMs must be licensed. To ensure licensing, a request is sent to the Key Management Service host servers that handle such queries. The request is made outbound through port 1688.
- **Virtual machines in load-balanced pools**: The source port and address range applied are from the originating computer, not the load balancer. The destination port and address range are for the destination computer, not the load balancer.
- **Azure service instances**: Instances of several Azure services, such as HDInsight, Application Service Environments, and Virtual Machine Scale Sets are deployed in virtual network subnets. Ensure you familiarize yourself with the port requirements for each service before applying a network security group to the subnet the resource is deployed in. If you deny ports required by the service, the service will not function properly. 

Security rules are stateful. If you specify an outbound security rule to any address over port 80, for example, it's not necessary to specify an inbound security rule for the response to the outbound traffic. You only need to specify an inbound security rule if communication is initiated externally. The opposite is also true. If inbound traffic is allowed over a port, it's not necessary to specify an outbound security rule to respond to traffic over the port.

## Default security rules

If a network security group is not associated to a subnet or network interface, all traffic is allowed inbound to, or outbound from, the subnet, or network interface. As soon as a network security group is created, Azure creates the following default rules within the network security group:

### Inbound

| Name | Priority | Source | Source ports | Destination | Destination ports | Protocol | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AllowVNetInBound |65000 | VirtualNetwork | 0-65535 | VirtualNetwork | 0-65535 | All | Allow |
| AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound | 65001 | AzureLoadBalancer | 0-65535 | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0-65535 | All | Allow |
| DenyAllInBound |65500 | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0-65535 | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0-65535 | All | Deny |

### Outbound

| Name | Priority | Source | Source ports | Destination | Destination ports | Protocol | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AllowVnetOutBound | 65000 | VirtualNetwork | 0-65535 | VirtualNetwork | 0-65535 | All | Allow |
| AllowInternetOutBound | 65001 | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0-65535 | Internet | 0-65535 | All | Allow |
| DenyAllOutBound | 65500 | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0-65535 | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0-65535 | All | Deny |


In the **Source** and **Destination** columns, *VirtualNetwork*, *AzureLoadBalancer*, and *Internet* are [service tags](#tags), rather than IP addresses. In the protocol column, **All** encompasses TCP, UDP, and ICMP. When creating a rule, you can specify TCP, UDP, or All, but you cannot specify ICMP alone. Therefore, if your rule requires ICMP, you must select All for protocol. *0.0.0.0/0* in the **Source** and **Destination** columns represents all addresses.
 
You cannot remove the default rules, but you can override them by creating rules with higher priorities.

## Service tag

 A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation. You cannot create your own service tag, nor specify which IP addresses are included within a tag. Microsoft updates the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. The following service tags are available for use in security rule definition, and vary slightly between [Azure deployment models](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json):

* **VirtualNetwork** (*Resource Manager) (**VIRTUAL_NETWORK** for classic): This tag includes the virtual network address space (all CIDR ranges defined for the virtual network), all connected on-premises address spaces, and [peered](virtual-network-peering-overview.md) virtual networks or virtual network connected to a [virtual network gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).
* **AzureLoadBalancer** (Resource Manager) (**AZURE_LOADBALANCER** for classic): This tag denotes Azure’s infrastructure load balancer. The tag translates to an [Azure datacenter IP address](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653) where Azure’s health probes originate. If you are not using the Azure load balancer, you can override this rule.
* **Internet** (Resource Manager) (**INTERNET** for classic): This tag denotes the Azure public IP address space. The addresses encompassed by this tag are listed in the [Azure owned public IP space](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653) document, which is regularly updated.
* **AzureTrafficManager** (Resource Manager only): This tag denotes @@@Need text describing what this encompasses Mario. I'm assuming this, Storage, and Sql are ARM NSGs only, that you can't use them in classic NSGs, but please confirm.@@@@@@.
* **Storage** (Resource Manager only): This tag denotes the address prefixes of Azure storage. If you specify *Storage* for the value, ports are open to Azure storage in all Azure [regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions). If you only want to allow access to Azure Storage in a specific region, you can specify a specific region. For example, if you want to allow access only to Azure Storage in the East US region, you could specify *Storage.EastUS* as a service tag. 
* **Sql** (Resource Manager only): This tag denotes the address prefixes of Azure SQL Database. You can only specify specific regions for this service tag. For example, if you want to allow access only to Azure SQL Database in the East US region, you could specify *Sql.EastUS* as a service tag. You cannot specify Sql only for all Azure regions, you must specify regions individually.

> [!NOTE]
> If you implement a virtual network [service endpoint](service-endpoint-overview.md) for a service such as Azure Storage or Azure SQL Database, Azure adds a route to a virtual network subnet for the service. The address prefixes for the route are the same address prefixes, or CIDR ranges, as the corresponding service tag.

## Application security group

Application security groups enable you to group virtual machines with like port filtering requirements together and specify the group as the source or destination address for [security rules](#security-rules). For example, if you wanted to always allow ports 80 and 443 inbound to web servers, you could:

1. Create an application security group named *ASG-Web-servers*.
2. Create a network security group named *NSG-Web-servers*.
3. Create an inbound security rule, specifying *ASG-Web-servers* as the destination address, that allows ports 80 and 443.
4. Deploy a virtual machine running a web server application. Specify that the network interface in the virtual machine is a member of the *ASG-Web-servers* application security group. Ports 80 and 443 are then allowed to the virtual machine.

@@@Mario: I need your help to make the value proposition come through here. Since an NSG ultimately still has to be applied to individual NICs or subnets, I'm not clear why I couldn't achieve the same goal by just specifying * as the destination IP address for a rule that allowed port 80 or 443 (on both, with the multi-value capability). What additional capability does the ASG provide that the NSG alone didn't provide?@@@
