# Copy data from SAP Table using Azure Data Factory

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from an SAP Table. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from SAP Table to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this SAP Table connector supports:

- SAP Table in any products belong to SAP Business Suite with version 7.01 or higher (in a recent SAP Support Package Stack released after the year 2015) or S/4HANA.
- Copying data from both SAP Transparent Table and View.
- Copying data using basic authentication or SNC if SNC is configured.
- Connecting to Application Server or Message Server.

## Prerequisites

To use this SAP Table connector, you need to:

- Set up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime with version 3.17 or above. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.

- Download the **64-bit [SAP .NET Connector 3.0](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/msnet.html)** from SAP's website, and install it on the Self-hosted IR machine. When installing, in the optional setup steps window, make sure you select the **Install Assemblies to GAC** option. 

- SAP user being used in the Data Factory SAP Table connector needs to have following permissions: 

    - Authorization for RFC. 
    - Permissions to the “Execute” Activity of Authorization Object “S_SDSAUTH”.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to SAP Table connector.

}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by SAP Table source.

### SAP Table as source

To copy data from SAP Table, set the source type in the copy activity to **SapTableSource**. While there are no additional type-specific properties needed in the copy activity **source** section.

| Property                         | Description                                                  | Required |
| :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| type                             | The type property must be set to **SapTableResource**.       | Yes      |
| rowCount                         | Number of rows to be retrieved.                              | No       |
| rfcTableFields                   | Fields of the SAP table that will be retrieved. For example, column0, column1. | No       |
| rfcTableOptions                  | Options for the filtering of the SAP Table. For example, COLUMN0 EQ SOME VALUE. | No       |
| customRfcReadTableFunctionModule | Custom RFC function module that will be used to read data from SAP Table. | No       |
| partitionOption                  | The partition mechanism that will be used for SAP table read in parallel. Current support options include: None, PartitionOnInt(normal integer or Integer values with zero padding on the left, such as 0000012345), PartitionOnCalendarYear (4 digits in format YYYY), PartitionOnCalendarMonth(6 digits in format YYYYMM), PartitionOnCalendarDate(8 digits in format YYYYMMDD) | No       |
| partitionColumnName              | The name of the column that will be used for proceeding partitioning. | No       |
| partitionUpperBound              | The maximum value of column specificed in partitionColumnName that will be used for proceeding partitioning. | No       |
| partitionLowerBound              | The minimum value of column specificed in partitionColumnName that will be used for proceeding partitioning. | No       |
| maxPartitionsNumber              | The maximum value of partitions the table will be splitted into. | No       |

>[!TIP]
>If your SAP table only large volume of data such as several billions, please use the partitionOption and partitionSetting to split the data into small partitions that will be read by partitions with each of the partition data can be retrieved by your server via one single RFC call.  Take partitionOnInt as example, the number of each partition will be calculated via (total rows falling between partitionUpperBound and partitionLowerBound)/maxPartitionsNumber.  If you would like to run in parallel,  it is strongly recommended to keep maxPartitionsNumber as a multiple of the value of parallelCopies.

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSAPTable",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<SAP Table input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SapTableSource",
                "partitionOption": "PartitionOnInt",
                "partitionSettings": {
                     "partitionColumnName": "columnname",
                     "partitionUpperBound": "2000",
                     "partitionLowerBound": "1",
                     "maxPartitionsNumber": 500
                 }
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Data type mapping for SAP Table

When copying data from SAP Table, the following mappings are used from SAP Table data types to Azure Data Factory interim data types. See [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md) to learn about how copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink.

| SAP ABAP Type | Data factory interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| C (String) | String |
| I (integer) | Int32 |
| F (Float) | Double |
| D (Date) | String |
| T (Time) | String |
| P (BCD Packed, Currency, Decimal, Qty) | Decimal |
| N (Numc) | String |
| X (Binary and Raw) | String |
