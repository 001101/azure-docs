# Copy data from SAP HANA using Azure Data Factory

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from a SAP HANA database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported scenarios

You can copy data from SAP HANA database to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this SAP HANA connector supports:

- Copying data from any version of SAP HANA database.
- Copying data from **HANA information models** (such as Analytic and Calculation views) and **Row/Column tables** using SQL queries.
- Copying data using **Basic** or **Windows** authentication.

## Prerequisites

To use this SAP HANA connector, you need to:

- Set up a self-hosted Integration Runtime. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article to learn details.
- Install the SAP HANA ODBC driver on the Integration Runtime machine. You can download the SAP HANA ODBC driver from the [SAP Software Download Center](https://support.sap.com/swdc). Search with the keyword **SAP HANA CLIENT for Windows**.

## Getting started

***[place-holder] generic section across all connectors. To link to a tutorial/sample and more instructions***

You can create a pipeline with copy activity using .NET SDK, Python SDK, Azure PowerShell, REST API, or Azure Resource Manager template. See [Copy activity tutorial](quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net.md) for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity.

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to SAP HANA connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for SAP HANA linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **SapHana** | Yes |
| server | Name of the server on which the SAP HANA instance resides. If your server is using a customized port, specify `server:port`. | Yes |
| authenticationType | Type of authentication used to connect to the SAP HANA database.<br/>Allowed values are: **Basic**, and **Windows** | Yes |
| username | Name of the user who has access to the SAP server. | Yes |
| password | Password for the user. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "SapHanaLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SapHana",
        "typeProperties": {
            "server": "<server>:<port (optional)>",
            "authenticationType": "Basic",
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by SAP HANA dataset.

To copy data from SAP HANA, set the type property of the dataset to **RelationalTable**. While there are no type-specific properties supported for the SAP HANA dataset of type RelationalTable.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "SAPHANADataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "RelationalTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<SAP HANA linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {}
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by SAP HANA source.

### SAP HANA as source

To copy data from SAP HANA, set the source type in the copy activity to **RelationalSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **RelationalSource** | Yes |
| query | Specifies the SQL query to read data from the SAP HANA instance. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSAPHANA",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<SAP HANA input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "RelationalSource",
                "query": "<SQL query for SAP HANA>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Data type mapping for SAP HANA

When copying data from SAP HANA, the following mappings are used from SAP HANA data types to Azure Data Factory interim data types. See [Schema and data type mappings](map-columns.md) to learn about how copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink.

| SAP HANA data type | Data factory interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| ALPHANUM | String |
| BIGINT | Int64 |
| BLOB | Byte[] |
| BOOLEAN | Byte |
| CLOB | Byte[] |
| DATE | DateTime |
| DECIMAL | Decimal |
| DOUBLE | Single |
| INT | Int32 |
| NVARCHAR | String |
| REAL | Single |
| SECONDDATE | DateTime |
| SMALLINT | Int16 |
| TIME | TimeSpan |
| TIMESTAMP | DateTime |
| TINYINT | Byte |
| VARCHAR | String |

## Known limitations

There are a few known limitations when copying data from SAP HANA:

- NVARCHAR strings are truncated to maximum length of 4000 Unicode characters
- SMALLDECIMAL is not supported
- VARBINARY is not supported
- Valid Dates are between 1899/12/30 and 9999/12/31
