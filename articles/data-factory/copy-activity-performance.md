# Copy Activity performance and tuning guide
Azure Data Factory Copy Activity delivers a first-class secure, reliable, and high-performance data loading solution. It enables you to copy tens of terabytes of data every day across a rich variety of cloud and on-premises data stores. Blazing-fast data loading performance is key to ensure you can focus on the core “big data” problem: building advanced analytics solutions and getting deep insights from all that data.

Azure provides a set of enterprise-grade data storage and data warehouse solutions, and Copy Activity offers a highly optimized data loading experience that is easy to configure and set up. With just a single copy activity, you can achieve:

* Loading data into **Azure SQL Data Warehouse** at **1.2 GBps**. For a walkthrough with a use case, see [Load 1 TB into Azure SQL Data Warehouse under 15 minutes with Azure Data Factory](copy-data-to-from-azure-sql-data-warehouse.md).
* Loading data into **Azure Blob storage** at **1.0 GBps**
* Loading data into **Azure Data Lake Store** at **1.0 GBps**

This article describes:

* [Performance reference numbers](#performance-reference) for supported source and sink data stores to help you plan your project;
* Features that can boost the copy throughput in different scenarios, including [cloud data movement units](#cloud-data-movement-units), [parallel copy](#parallel-copy), and [staged Copy](#staged-copy);
* [Performance tuning guidance](#performance-tuning-steps) on how to tune the performance and the key factors that can impact copy performance.

## Performance reference

## Parallel copy

## Staged copy

## Performance tuning steps

## Considerations for Data Management Gateway

## Considerations for the source

## Considerations for the sink

## Considerations for serialization and deserialization

## Considerations for compression

## Considerations for column mapping

## Other considerations

## Sample scenario: Copy from an on-premises SQL Server to Blob storage
## Sample scenarios: Use parallel copy

## Reference
Here is performance monitoring and tuning references for some of the supported data stores:

* Azure Storage (including Blob storage and Table storage): [Azure Storage scalability targets](../storage/common/storage-scalability-targets.md) and [Azure Storage performance and scalability checklist](../storage/common/storage-performance-checklist.md)
* Azure SQL Database: You can [monitor the performance](../sql-database/sql-database-single-database-monitor.md) and check the database transaction unit (DTU) percentage
* Azure SQL Data Warehouse: Its capability is measured in data warehouse units (DWUs); see [Manage compute power in Azure SQL Data Warehouse (Overview)](../sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-manage-compute-overview.md)
* Azure Cosmos DB: [Performance levels in Azure Cosmos DB](../cosmos-db/performance-levels.md)
* On-premises SQL Server: [Monitor and tune for performance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189081.aspx)
* On-premises file server: [Performance tuning for file servers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn567661.aspx)
