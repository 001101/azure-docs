# Encrypt credentials for on-premises data stores in Azure Data Factory
You can encrypt and store credentials for your on-premises data stores (linked services with sensitive information) on a machine with self-hosted integration runtime. You pass a JSON definition file with credentials to the **Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2LinkedServiceEncryptCredential** cmdlet to produce an output JSON definition file with the encrypted credentials. Then, use the updated JSON definition to create the linked services.

The following procedure creates a SQL Server linked service based on a JSON definition file that has encrypted credentials:  

1. Create a JSON file named **SqlServerLinkedService.json** in any folder with the following content:  

   Replace `<servername>`, `<databasename>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with values for your SQL Server before saving the file. And, replace `<integration runtime name>` with the name of your integration runtime. 

	```json
	{
		"properties": {
			"type": "SqlServer",
			"typeProperties": {
				"connectionString": {
					"type": "SecureString",
					"value": "Server=<servername>;Database=<databasename>;User ID=<username>;Password=<password>;Timeout=60"
				}
			},
			"connectVia": {
				"type": "integrationRuntimeReference",
				"referenceName": "<integration runtime name>"
			},
			"name": "SqlServerLinkedService"
		}
	}
   ```

2. To encrypt the sensitive data from the JSON payload on an on-premises self-hosted integration runtime, run **Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2LinkedServiceEncryptCredential**, and pass on the JSON payload. This ensures the credentials are encrypted using DPAPI and stored on the self-hosted integration runtime node locally. The output payload can be redirected to another JSON file (in this case 'encryptedLinkedService.json'), which contains encrypted credentials.

	```powershell
	Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2LinkedServiceEncryptCredential -DataFactory $df -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name "SqlServerLinkedService" -File ".\SQLServerLinkedService.json" > encryptedSQLServerLinkedService.json
	```
3. Now, use the output JSON file from the previous command containing the encrypted credential to setup the **SqlServerLinkedService**.

	```powershell
	Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2LinkedService -DataFactory $df -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name "EncryptedSqlServerLinkedService" -File ".\encryptedSqlServerLinkedService.json" 
	```
