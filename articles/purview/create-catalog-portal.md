# Quickstart: Create an Azure Purview account

In this quickstart, you create an Azure Purview account.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* Your own [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant).

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.

## Configure your subscription

If necessary, follow these steps to configure your subscription to enable Azure Purview to run in your subscription:

   1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Subscriptions**.

   1. From the list of subscriptions, select the subscription you want to use. Administrative access permission for the subscription is required.

   1. For your subscription, select **Resource providers**. On the **Resource providers** pane, search for the **Microsoft.ProjectBabylon** resource provider. If it isn't registered, register it by selecting **Register**.

   You can add only one Azure Purview account at a time.

1. Select a **Resource group**, and then enter a **Purview account name** for your catalog. Spaces and symbols aren't allowed.

1. Make a choice for **Location**, and then select **Next: Tags**.
1. Optionally, add one or more tags. These tags are for use only in the Azure portal, not the catalog.
1. Select **Review & Create**, and then select **Create**. It takes a few minutes to complete the catalog creation. The newly created Azure Purview account instance appears in the list on your **Purview accounts** page.
1. When the new account is ready, select **Go to resource**.

1. Select **Launch purview account**.
