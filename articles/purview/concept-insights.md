# Understand Insights in Azure Purview

This article provides an overview of the Insights feature in Azure Purview. 

## Insights

Insights is one of the key pillars of Purview. The feature provides customers, a single pane of glass view into their catalog and further aims to provide specific insights to the administrators of the catalog, data stewards, Chief Data Officer and Chief Security Officer. Currently, Purview has the following Insights reports that will be available to customers at public preview.

### Asset Insights
This report gives a bird's eye view of your data estate, and distribution of assets across source types. This is a helpful report for the administrators who want to create and manage their Purview accounts.

### Scan Insights
This report is meant for the administrators who register and scan sources in Purview. It gives a summary view of the scan status over time.

### Glossary Insights
