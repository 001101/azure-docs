# Overview of Availability Zones

Though the cloud feels like it's everywhere, in reality, your data and applications are running in specific physical locations. Unforeseen events can have catastrophic impacts on those physical locations. And for this reason, it makes sense to distribute your data and applications to ensure their availability. Region pairs help with availability by pairing one Azure region with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia). Availability Zones expands the level of control you have to maintain the availability of your applications and data. An Availability Zone is a physically separate zone within an Azure region. There are three Availability Zones per Azure region. Each Availability Zone has a distinct power source, network, cooling, and is logically separate from the other Availability Zones within the Azure region. If one Availability Zone is compromised, then replicated data is instantly available in another zone.

Availability Zones protect against hardware, network, cooling, and power failures that can compromise a datacenter.
