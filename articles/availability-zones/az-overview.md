# Regions and Availability Zones in Azure

Microsoft Azure services are available globally to drive your cloud operations at an optimal level. You can choose the best region for your needs based on technical and regulatory considerations: service capabilities, data residency, compliance requirements, and latency.

## Terminology

To better understand regions and Availability Zones in Azure, it helps to understand key terms or concepts.

| Term or concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| region | A set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. |
| Availability Zone | Unique physical locations within a region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. |
| recommended region | A region that provides the broadest range of capabilities and meets in-country data residency requirements. |
| alternate region | An alternate region that provides proactive support around disaster recovery, meets in-country data residency, and provides an additional location to improve latency . |
| foundational service | A core Azure service that is available in all regions when the region is generally available. |
| mainstream service | An Azure service that is available in all recommended regions within one year of the region/service general availability or demand-driven availability in alternate regions. |
| specialized service | An Azure service that is demand-driven availability across regions backed by customized/specialized hardware. |

## Regions

A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. Azure gives you the flexibility to deploy applications where you need to. Azure’s approach on availability of Azure services across regions is best described in two ways – recommended regions and alternate regions.

### Recommended regions

A recommended region is a region that provides the broadest range of capabilities, which include the following:

- Meet in-country data residency requirements
- Designed to support Availability Zones now or in the future

The Azure services available in recommended regions enable you to perform cloud operations at an optimal level. The services are grouped in three categories – Foundational, Mainstream, and Specialized services. 

- Foundational – available in all regions when the region is generally available. When unavailable, Microsoft is working on region-specific improvements to deploy across all regions. 
- Mainstream – available in all Recommended regions within one year of the region/service general availability. When unavailable, Microsoft is working on region-specific improvements to deploy across all recommended regions. 
- Specialized – demand-driven availability across regions backed by customized/specialized hardware, with many already deployed into a large subset of Recommended regions. 

Availability Zones are currently/planned to be available in most recommended regions. If a service offering is not available in a specific region, you can share your interest by contacting your Microsoft sales representative.

### Alternate regions

An alternate region is a region that extends Azure's footprint. Alternate regions are listed as **other** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and include the following capabilities:

- Meet in-country data residency
- Additional location to improve latency and provide a second region for disaster recovery needs
- Not designed to support Availability Zones

The Azure services available in alternate regions support your business needs around disaster recovery, data residency, and improving latency. There are three categories of Azure services.

- Foundational – available in all regions when the region is generally available. When unavailable, Microsoft is working on region-specific improvements to deploy across all regions. 
- Mainstream – demand-driven availability in alternate regions; not targeted at parity. 
- Specialized – demand-driven availability across regions backed by customized/specialized hardware; not targeted at parity. 

If a service offering is not available in a specific region, you can share your interest by contacting your Microsoft sales representative.

### Comparing region types

| Region type | Non-regional services | Foundational services | Mainstream services | Specialized services | Availability Zones | Data residency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recommenced | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Demand-driven | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Alternate | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Demand-driven | Demand-driven | N/A | :heavy_check_mark: |

### Service categories

Azure classifies services into three categories: foundational, mainstream, and specialized. The services in this section are public services that are regional only. This section excludes virtual machine SKUs listed as **older-gen** on [TBD]. For information about non-regional services, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

## Availability Zones

Availability Zones is a high-availability offering that protects your applications and data from datacenter failures. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there's a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures. Zone-redundant services replicate your applications and data across Availability Zones to protect from single-points-of-failure. With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. The full [Azure SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/) explains the guaranteed availability of Azure as a whole.

An Availability Zone in an Azure region is a combination of a fault domain and an update domain. For example, if you create three or more VMs across three zones in an Azure region, your VMs are effectively distributed across three fault domains and three update domains. The Azure platform recognizes this distribution across update domains to make sure that VMs in different zones are not updated at the same time.

Build high-availability into your application architecture by co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within a zone and replicating in other zones. Azure services that support Availability Zones fall into two categories:

- **Zonal services** – you pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, virtual machines, managed disks, Standard IP addresses), or
- **Zone-redundant services** – platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).

To achieve comprehensive business continuity on Azure, build your application architecture using the combination of Availability Zones with Azure region pairs. You can synchronously replicate your applications and data using Availability Zones within an Azure region for high-availability and asynchronously replicate across Azure regions for disaster recovery protection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Availability Zone identifiers (the numbers 1, 2 and 3 in the picture above) are logically mapped to the actual physical zones for each subscription independently. That means that Availability Zone 1 in a given subscription might refer to a different physical zone than Availability Zone 1 in a different subscription. As a consequence, it's recommended to not rely on Availability Zone IDs across different subscriptions for virtual machine placement.

###  Services resiliency

All Azure management services are architected to be resilient from region-level failures. In the spectrum of failures, one or more Availability Zone failures within a region have a smaller failure radius compared to an entire region failure. Azure can recover from a zone-level failure of management services within the region or from another Azure region. Azure performs critical maintenance one zone at a time within a region, to prevent any failures impacting customer resources deployed across Availability Zones within a region.

### Pricing for VMs in Availability Zones

There is no additional cost for virtual machines deployed in an Availability Zone. 99.99% VM uptime SLA is offered when two or more VMs are deployed across two or more Availability Zones within an Azure region. There will be additional inter-Availability Zone VM-to-VM data transfer charges. For more information, review the [Bandwidth pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/) page.
