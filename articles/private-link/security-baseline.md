# Security baseline for Azure Private Link

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview) to Azure Private Link. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Private Link. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Private Link have been excluded. To see how Azure Private Link completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Private Link security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/spreadsheets/security_baselines).

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

* [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

* [Microsoft Security Response Center's Anatomy of an Incident](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/06/27/inside-the-msrc-anatomy-of-a-ssirp-incident/)

* [Customer may also leverage NIST's Computer Security Incident Handling Guide to aid in the creation of their own incident response plan](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

* [Use tags to organize your Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-using-tags)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systems’ incident response capabilities on a regular cadence to help protect your Azure resources. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

* [How to set the Azure Security Center Security Contact](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.

* [How to stream alerts into Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-azure-security-center)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.6: Automate the response to security alerts

**Guidance**: Use the Workflow Automation feature in Azure Security Center to automatically trigger responses via "Logic Apps" on security alerts and recommendations to protect your Azure resources.

### 11.1: Conduct regular penetration testing of your Azure resources and ensure remediation of all critical security findings

**Guidance**: Follow the Microsoft Rules of Engagement to ensure your Penetration Tests are not in violation of Microsoft policies. Use Microsoft’s strategy and execution of Red Teaming and live site penetration testing against Microsoft-managed cloud infrastructure, services, and applications.
