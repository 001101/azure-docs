# What is Azure Private Link? (Preview)
Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a [Private Endpoint](private-endpoint-overview.md) in your virtual network. You can also create your own [Private Link Service](private-link-service-overview.md) in your virtual network (VNet) and deliver it privately to your customers. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone privately, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. The setup and consumption experience using Azure Private Link is consistent across Azure PaaS, customer-owned, and shared partner services.

## Key benefits
Azure Private Link provides the following benefits:  
- **Privately access services on the Azure platform**: With Azure Private Link, you can connect your virtual networks to services delivered on the Azure platform in a secure and scalable manner. Service providers can render their services privately in consumer’s virtual networks and service consumers can consume services privately in their virtual networks on the Azure platform. 
 
- **Works with on-premises and peered networks**: With Azure Private Link, customers can access private endpoints over private peering/VPN tunnels (from on-premises) and peered virtual networks. Traffic from the private endpoint to the service are route-optimized and are carried over the Microsoft backbone. There is no need to set up public peering or traverse the internet to reach the service. This ability provides flexibility for customers to migrate their workloads to the cloud.  
 
- **Data Exfil protection**: With Azure Private Link, you get implicit Data Exfil protection when connecting to Azure PaaS. Individual Azure PaaS resources are mapped to the private endpoints instead of the Azure service. Therefore, a malicious insider can access only the mapped account and no other account thus eliminating the data exfil threat. 
 
- **Meet compliance needs**: With Azure Private Link, customer information is shared with services on the Azure platform over a secured Microsoft backbone and doesn’t traverse the internet. This helps to prevent information from being compromised and maintains compliance with regulation authorities such as HIPAA or PCI.
 
- **Global reach**: With Azure Private Link, you can connect privately to services running in other regions. This means that the consumers virtual network and services can be in different regions. Azure Private Link is global in nature and there are no regional restrictions.   
 
- **Extend to your own services**: With Azure Private Link, you can leverage the same experience and functionality to render your own service privately in your customer virtual networks or your own virtual networks on the Azure platform. Azure Private Link works across Active Directory tenants and work on the provider's consumer model with an approval call flow. Moreover, there is no requirement of non-overlapping address spaces as in virtual network peering.

## Why use Azure Private Link?
Use Azure Private Link to access Azure services or your own services privately and securely. Previously, Azure services (such as Storage, SQL, etc.) or customer-owned services needed to be accessed over Public IP endpoints. With Azure Private Link, this is no longer the case. The need for Internet exposed endpoints is removed. You can privately connect to services in other Virtual Networks easily and securely.

## Availability 
 The following table lists the Private Link services and the regions where they are available. Note that the Private Link Service and the VNet hosting the private endpoint must be in the same region.

## Logging and monitoring

Azure Private Link is fully integrated with Azure Monitor. This integration allows you to archive logs to a storage account, stream events to your Event Hub, or send them to Azure Monitor logs. You can access the following information on Azure Monitor: 
- **Private endpoint**: Data processed by the Private Endpoint  (IN/OUT)
 
- **Private Link service**:
    - Data processed by the Private Link service (IN/OUT)
    - NAT port availability
