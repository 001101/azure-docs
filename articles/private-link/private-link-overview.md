# What is Azure Private Link? (Preview)

Azure Private Link provides private connectivity between applications running in different virtual networks and to Azure PaaS services (such as Storage, SQL Database, etc.) using the Microsoft network. Azure Private Link simplifies the network architecture and secures the connection between endpoints in Azure by eliminating data exposure to the public internet. Azure Private Link also extends this ability to customer-owned services and shared marketplace services run by partners. The setup and consumption experience using Azure Private Link is consistent across Azure PaaS, customer-owned services, and shared partner services. The technology works on a provider and consumer model where the provider renders the service and consumer consumes the service. A connection is established between the provider and the consumer based on an approval call flow. After the connection is established, all data that flows between the service provider and service consumer is isolated from the internet and stays on the Microsoft backend. Both the provider and the consumer must be on Azure to use the Azure Private Link service. There is no need for any sort of gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute, VPN connections, or public IP addresses to communicate with the service.

## Why use Azure Private Link?
Use Azure Private Link to access Azure services or your own services privately and securely. Previously, Azure services (such as Storage, SQL, etc.) or customer-owned services needed to be accessed over Public IP endpoints. With Azure Private Link, this is no longer the case, the need for Internet exposed endpoints or Public IP endpoints is removed. You can privately connect to services in other Virtual Networks easily and securely.

## Key benefits
Azure Private Link provides the following benefits:  
- **Privately access services on the Azure platform**: With Azure Private Link, you can connect your virtual networks to services delivered on the Azure platform in a secure and scalable manner. Service providers can render their services privately in consumer’s virtual networks and service consumers can consume services privately in their virtual networks on the Azure platform. 
 
- **Works with on-premises and peered networks**: With Azure Private Link, customers can access private endpoints over private peering/VPN tunnels (from on-premises) and peered virtual networks. Traffic from the private endpoint to the service are route-optimized and are carried over the Microsoft backbone. There is no need to set up public peering or traverse the internet to reach the service. This ability provides flexibility for customers to migrate their workloads to the cloud.  
 
- **Data Exfil protection**: With Azure Private Link, you get implicit Data Exfil protection when connecting to Azure PaaS. Individual Azure PaaS resources are mapped to the private endpoints instead of the Azure service. Therefore, a malicious insider can access only the mapped account and no other account thus eliminating the data exfil threat. 
 
- **Meet compliance needs**: With Azure Private Link, customer information is shared with services on the Azure platform over a secured Microsoft backbone and doesn’t traverse the internet. This helps to prevent information from being compromised and maintains compliance with regulation authorities such as HIPAA or PCI.
 
- **Global reach**: With Azure Private Link, you can connect privately to services running in other regions. This means that the consumers virtual network and services can be in different regions. Azure Private Link is global in nature and there are no regional restrictions.   
 
- **Extend to your own services**: With Azure Private Link, you can leverage the same experience and functionality to render your own service privately in your customer virtual networks or your own virtual networks on the Azure platform. Azure Private Link works across Active Directory tenants and work on the provider's consumer model with an approval call flow. Moreover, there is no requirement of non-overlapping address spaces as in virtual network peering.

## Private Link service
The Private Link service is a virtual networking resource, modeled as a network interface card in the service provider's virtual network. This resource is applicable mainly in Microsoft partner service and customer-owned service scenarios. Service providers need to create the resource to let consumers consume the service privately over the Azure Private Link. The resource is tied to the front-end IP configuration of a Standard Load Balancer. The Private Link service serves as a front end for the service provider's applications that are running behind the Standard Load Balancer. Service consumers connect to the Private Link service over the Azure Private Link through private endpoints in the consumer's virtual networks. For more information about the Private Link service, see [What is Private Link service?](private-link-service-overview.md)

## Private Endpoint
Private Endpoint is a virtual networking resource, modeled as a network interface card, in a service consumer's virtual network. Private endpoints get assigned a private IP address from the customer's virtual network. Private endpoints enable Azure customers to privately connect to supported Azure services through Azure Private Link. These services can include Azure PaaS, Microsoft partner services, and customer-owned services. Supported Azure services are mapped inside the customer's virtual network as private endpoints. Private endpoints are the entry points for the service traffic over Private Links from Azure virtual network resources. The traffic never leaves the Microsoft backbone. These are highly available instances and do not pose any bandwidth restrictions on the service traffic.

## Logging and monitoring

Azure Private Link is fully integrated with Azure Monitor. This integration allows you to archive logs to a storage account, stream events to your Event Hub, or send them to Azure Monitor logs. You can access the following information on Azure Monitor: 
- **Private endpoint**: Data processed by the Private Endpoint  (IN/OUT)
 
- **Private Link service**:
    - Data processed by the Private Link service (IN/OUT)
    - NAT port availability
