# Azure security baseline for Data Lake Analytics

The Azure Security Baseline for Data Lake Analytics contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see the [Azure security baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

*For more information, see [Security control: Inventory and asset management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-inventory-asset-management).*

### 6.1: Use Azure Asset Discovery

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/22964).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Resource Graph to query/discover all resources (such as compute, storage, network, ports, and protocols etc.) within your subscription(s). Ensure appropriate (read) permissions in your tenant and enumerate all Azure subscriptions as well as resources within your subscriptions.

Although classic Azure resources may be discovered via Resource Graph, it is highly recommended to create and use Azure Resource Manager resources going forward.

The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
