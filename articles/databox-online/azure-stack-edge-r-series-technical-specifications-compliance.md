# Azure Stack Edge technical specifications

The hardware components of your Microsoft Azure Stack Edge device adhere to the technical specifications and regulatory standards outlined in this article. The technical specifications describe the Power supply units (PSUs), storage capacity, enclosures, and environmental standards.

## Compute, memory specifications

The Azure Stack Edge device has the following specifications for compute and memory:

| Specification           | Value                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| CPU    | 2 X 10 core CPU, Intel Xeon Silver 4114 |
| Memory              | 256 GB RAM (2666 MT/s)                  |


## FPGA specifications

A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is included on every Azure Stack Edge device that enables Machine Learning (ML) scenarios. 

| Specification           | Value                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| FPGA   | Intel Arria 10 <br> Available Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are the same as those [supported by cloud FPGA instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service#whats-supported-on-azure).|


## Power supply unit specifications

The Azure Stack Edge device has two 100-240 V Power supply units (PSUs) with high-performance fans. The two PSUs provide a redundant power configuration. If a PSU fails, the device continues to operate normally on the other PSU until the failed module is replaced. The following table lists the technical specifications of the PSUs.

|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Maximum output power    | 550 W                      |
| Heat                    | 2891 BTU/hr                |
| Frequency               | 50/60 Hz                   |
| Voltage range selection | Auto ranging: 115-230 V AC |
| Hot pluggable           | Yes                        |


## Storage specifications

The Azure Stack Edge devices have 8 data disks and 2 M.2 SATA disks that serve as operating system disks. For more information, go to [M.2 SATA disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2).

The following table has the details for the storage capacity of the device.

|     Specification                          |     Value             |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
|    Number of solid-state drives (SSDs)     |    8                  |
|    Single SSD capacity                     |    8 TB               |
|    Total capacity                          |    64 TB              |
|    Total usable capacity*                  |    ~ 55.9 TB          |

**Some space is reserved for internal use.*
