![No User Serviceable Parts Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-mini-r-safety/icon-safety-do-not-access.png) **CAUTION:**

* This equipment contains a lithium battery. Do not attempt servicing the battery pack. Batteries in this equipment are not user serviceable. Risk of Explosion if battery is replaced by an incorrect type.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-mini-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png) **CAUTION:**

* The ON/OFF switch on the battery pack is for discharging the battery to the server module only. If the power adapter is plugged into the battery pack, power is passed to the server module even if the switch is in the OFF position.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-mini-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png) **CAUTION:**

* Do not burn or short circuit the battery pack. It must be recycled or disposed of properly.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-mini-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png) **CAUTION:**

* In lieu of using the provided AC/DC power supply, this system also has the option to use a field provided Type 2590 Battery. In this case, the end user shall verify that it meets all applicable safety, transportation, environmental, and any other national/local regulations.
* When operating the system with Type 2590 Battery, operate the battery within the conditions of use specified by the battery manufacturer.

## Electrical precautions

The Azure Stack Edge Mini R device has the following electrical precautions:

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-mini-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png) ![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-mini-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png) **WARNING:**

When used with the power supply adaptor:

* Provide a safe electrical earth connection to the power supply cord. The alternating current (AC) cord has a three-wire grounding plug (a plug that has a grounding pin). This plug fits only a grounded AC outlet. Do not defeat the purpose of the grounding pin.
* Given that the plug on the power supply cord is the main disconnect device, ensure that the socket outlets are located near the device and are easily accessible.
* Unplug the power cord(s) (by pulling the plug, not the cord) and disconnect all cables if any of the following conditions exist:

  * The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged.
  * The device is exposed to rain, excess moisture, or other liquids.
  * The device has been dropped and the device casing has been damaged.
  * You suspect the device needs service or repair.
* Permanently unplug the unit before you move it or if you think it has become damaged in any way.

Provide a suitable power source with electrical overload protection to meet the following power specifications:

* Voltage: 100 to 240 Volts AC.
* Current: 15 Amps, maximum per power cord. Power cord(s) are provided.
* Frequency: 50 to 60 Hz.
