# What is the Rugged Edge Appliance?

The Rugged Edge Appliance is a part of the Azure Stack Edge Rugged Series. It is a durable, ruggedized and portable edge appliance appropriate for use by mounted and dismounted patrols and expeditionary forces, that runs managed compute and storage services and is optimized for AI, analytics, and serverless computing.

This article provides you an overview of the Azure Stack Edge Rugged series solution, benefits, key capabilities, and the scenarios where you can deploy this device.

Azure Stack Edge Rugged series is a Hardware-as-a-service solution. Microsoft ships you a rugged, cloud-managed device with a built-in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that enables accelerated AI-inferencing and has all the capabilities of a network storage gateway.

## Available models

Azure Stack Edge is offered as:

- **Azure Stack Edge commercial series** - The commercial series is tailored for most commercial scenarios, such as retail stores and datacenters.
- **Azure Stack Edge rugged series** - The rugged series is tailored for harsh environmental or field conditions, such as in defense, disaster relief, geological surveys, and energy. Rugged and portable form factors are available. The rugged series is available as the following SKUs:

|Model name|Model description  |Cluster |Configuration |
|----|---------|---------|---------|
|Rugged Edge Appliance|Azure Stack Edge Rugged with FPGA   | 1-node | Device in rugged case<br>Device + UPS in rugged case <br>Device + heater in rugged case<br>Device with UPS + heater in rugged case        |
|Rugged Edge Appliance|Azure Stack Edge Rugged with FPGA   |  4-node | 4 single-node device + heater in rugged case, 4 UPS in second rugged case |
|Rugged Mobile Appliance|Azure Stack Edge Rugged with VPU |  Portable | With battery |

## Use cases

Here are the various scenarios where Azure Stack Edge can be used for rapid Machine Learning (ML) inferencing at the edge and preprocessing data before sending it to Azure.

- **Inference with Azure Machine Learning** - With Azure Stack Edge, you can run ML models to get quick results that can be acted on before the data is sent to the cloud. The full data set can optionally be transferred to continue to retrain and improve your ML models. For more information on how to use the Azure ML hardware accelerated models on the Azure Stack Edge device, see 
[Deploy Azure ML hardware accelerated models on Azure Stack Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service#deploy-to-a-local-edge-server).

- **Preprocess data** - Transform data before sending it to Azure to create a more actionable dataset. Preprocessing can be used to:

    - Aggregate data.
    - Modify data, for example to remove personal data.
    - Subset data to optimize storage and bandwidth, or for further analysis.
    - Analyze and react to IoT Events.

- **Transfer data over network to Azure** - Use Azure Stack Edge to easily and quickly transfer data to Azure to enable further compute and analytics or for archival purposes.

|Bandwidth throttling| Throttle to limit bandwidth usage during peak hours.|

## Components

The Azure Stack Edge solution comprises of an Azure Stack Edge resource, Azure Stack Edge rugged, physical device, and a local web UI.

- **Azure Stack Edge physical device** - The Azure Stack Edge J-series device can be a 1-node or a 4-node device. 

    A 1-node device is a 1U server with a rugged encasing supplied by Microsoft that can be configured to send data to Azure. Optionally, the server is available with a UPS (also 1U) and a heater.

    A 4-node device has four 1U servers with a heater with a rugged encasing supplied by Microsoft. Optionally, the device is also available with 4 UPS servers in a separate rugged case.

    <!--![The Azure Stack Edge 4-node device](media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-overview/device-image-1.png)-->

- **Azure Stack Edge resource** â€“ A resource in the Azure portal that lets you manage a rugged, Azure Stack Edge device from a web interface that you can access from different geographical locations. Use the Azure Stack Edge resource to create and manage resources, view, and manage devices and alerts, and manage shares.

    For more information, go to [Create an order for your Azure Stack Edge device](azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-prep.md).

- **Azure Stack Edge local web UI** - Use the local web UI for initial device configuration, to run diagnostics, shut down and restart the Azure Stack Edge device, view copy logs, and contact Microsoft Support to file a service request.

    For information about using the web-based UI, go to [Use the web-based UI to administer your Azure Stack Edge](azure-stack-edge-j-series-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md).

## Clustering on a 4-node device

Your Azure Stack Edge device is available as a 1-node device and a 4-node device. A 1-node device can withstand a single disk failure or a power supply failure. However, if the device node goes down, then the device fails. The 4-node device is highly available also at the node level and can withstand the failure of a single node. 

The 4-node device implements Windows Failover Clustering with the 4 nodes working together to increase the availability and scalability of  clustered roles. The clustered nodes here are connected by physical cables and by software. If one of the nodes fails, the other nodes take over and begin to provide service. With the Failover Clustering feature, users experience a minimum of disruptions in service.  All the processes or resources, for example, management, datapath that run on this device are clustered resources and can survive one node failures. For more information, go to [Failover clustering overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-clustering-overview).

Apart from the high availability, the capacity is also scaled. A storage pool is created from the all the disks across all the 4 nodes and can be used to create multi-resilient volumes. The total usable capacity is about 70% of the total disk capacity after mirroring and parity. A cluster shared volume is created that provides a consistent, distributed namespace that clustered roles can use to access shared storage from all the nodes. Each node can withstand a failure of up to one disk (worth capacity).

The compute is also clustered for availability. Kubernetes can then leverage compute acceleration hardware on all the nodes to deploy containerized applications.

## Region availability

Azure Stack Edge physical device, Azure resource, and target storage account to which you transfer data do not all have to be in the same region.

- **Resource availability** - For a list of all the regions where the Azure Stack Edge resource is available, go to [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=databox&regions=all). Azure Stack Edge can also be deployed in the Azure Government Cloud. For more information, see [What is Azure Government?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome).

- **Destination Storage accounts** - The storage accounts that store the data are available in all Azure regions. The regions where the storage accounts store Azure Stack Edge data should be located close to where the device is located for optimum performance. A storage account located far from the device results in long latencies and slower performance.

## Next steps

- Review the [Azure Stack Edge system requirements](azure-stack-edge-j-series-system-requirements.md).
- Understand the [Azure Stack Edge limits](azure-stack-edge-j-series-limits.md).
- Deploy [Azure Azure Stack Edge](azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-prep.md) in Azure portal.
