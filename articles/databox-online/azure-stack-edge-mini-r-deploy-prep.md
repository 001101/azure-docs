## Prerequisites

Following are the configuration prerequisites for your Azure Stack Edge resource, your Azure Stack Edge device, and the datacenter network.

### For the Azure Stack Edge resource

Before you begin, make sure that:

* Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/).
* You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge/Azure Storage Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.

    * To create any Azure Stack Edge resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](azure-stack-edge-j-series-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
    * To create any IoT Hub resource, make sure that Microsoft.Devices provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](azure-stack-edge-j-series-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
    * To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider.
* You have admin or user access to AzureÂ Active Directory Graph API. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes#default-access-for-administrators-users-and-guest-users-).
- You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.

### For the Azure Stack Edge device

Before you deploy a physical device, make sure that:

- You've reviewed the safety information for this device at [Safety guidelines for your Azure Stack Edge device](azure-stack-edge-mini-r-safety.md).
- You have access to a flat, stable, and level work surface where the device can rest safely.
- The site where you intend to set up the device has standard AC power from an independent source or a rack power distribution unit (PDU).
- You have received the physical device.

### For the datacenter network

Before you begin, make sure that:

- The network in your datacenter is configured per the networking requirements for your Azure Stack Edge device. For more information, see [Azure Stack Edge Mini R system requirements](azure-stack-edge-mini-r-system-requirements.md).

- For normal operating conditions of your Azure Stack Edge, you have:

    - A minimum of 10-Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
    - A minimum of 20-Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.

## Create a new resource

If you have an existing Azure Stack Edge resource to manage your physical device, skip this step and go to [Get the activation key](#get-the-activation-key).

To create a Azure Stack Edge resource, take the following steps in the Azure portal.

1. Use your Microsoft Azure credentials to sign in to the Azure portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).


2. In the left-pane, select **+ Create a resource**.
