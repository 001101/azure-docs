NOTE:
If you are using a virtual device, then the hardware diagnostics tests are not available.


## Collect Support package

Perform the following steps to collect a Support package. 

A log package is comprised of all the relevant logs that can assist Data Box Gateway Support with troubleshooting any device issues. In this release, a log package can be generated via the local web UI.

1.	In the local web UI, go to Troubleshooting > Support. Click Create support package. The system starts collecting support package. The package collection may take several minutes.
 
2.	After the Support package is created, click Download Support package. A zipped package is downloaded on the path you chose. You can unzip the package and the view the system log files.


## Use logs to troubleshoot

Any errors experienced during the upload and refresh processes are included in the respective error files.

To view the error files, go to your share and click the share to view the contents. 
  

Click the _Microsoft Data Box Gateway folder_. This folder contains two subfolders â€“ Upload containing log files for upload errors and Refresh for errors during refresh.

Here is a sample log file for refresh.
<root container="brownbag1" machine="VM15BS020663" timestamp="07/18/2018 00:11:10" />
<file item="test.txt" local="False" remote="True" error="16001" />
<summary runtime="00:00:00.0945320" errors="1" creates="2" deletes="0" insync="3" replaces="0" pending="9" />

When you see an error in this file (highlighted in the sample), note down the error code, in this case it is 16001. You need to look up the description of this error code against the following error reference.
