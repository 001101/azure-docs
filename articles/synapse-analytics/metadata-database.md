# Azure Synapse Analytics shared database

Azure Synapse Analytics allows the different computational engines of a workspace to share databases and tables between its Apache Spark pools, SQL on-demand engine, and SQL pools.

[!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-preview-terms](../../includes/synapse-analytics-preview-terms.md)]

Once a database has been created with a Spark job, that database will become visible as a database with that same name to all current and future Spark pools in the workspace as well as the SQL on-demand engine. 

If there are SQL pools in the workspace that have their metadata synchronization enabled or if a new SQL pool is being created with the metadata synchronization enabled, these Spark created databases will be mapped automatically into special schemas in the SQL pool database. Each such schema is named after the Spark database name with an additional `$` prefix. Both the external and managed tables in the Spark-generated database are exposed as external tables in the corresponding special schema. 

The Spark default database, called `default`, will also be visible in the SQL on-demand context as a database called `default`, and in any of the SQL pool databases with metadata synchronization turned on as the schema `$default`.

Since the databases are synchronized to SQL on-demand and the SQL pools asynchronously, there will be a delay until they appear.

## Manage a Spark created database

[!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-preview-features](../../includes/synapse-analytics-preview-features.md)]

Use Spark to manage Spark created databases. For example, delete it through a Spark pool job, and create tables in it from Spark. 

If you create objects in such a database from SQL on-demand or try to drop the database, the operation will succeed, but the original Spark database will not be changed.

If you try to drop the synchronized schema in a SQL Pool, or try to create a table in it, Azure returns an error.

## Handling of name conflicts

[!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-preview-features](../../includes/synapse-analytics-preview-features.md)]

During public preview, it can happen that the name of a Spark database can conflict with the name of an existing SQL on-demand database. In this case, the Spark database will be exposed in SQL on-demand with a different name, that got created by adding a post-fix of the form `_<workspace name>-ondemand-DefaultSparkConnector` to the Spark database name. 

For example, if a Spark database called `mydb` gets created in the Azure Synapse workspace `myws` and a SQL on-demand database with that name already exists, then the Spark database in SQL on-demand will have to be referenced using the name `mydb_myws-ondemand-DefaultSparkConnector`.

## Security model

[!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-preview-features](../../includes/synapse-analytics-preview-features.md)]

The Spark databases and tables, as well as their synchronized representations in the SQL engines will be secured at the underlying storage level. 

The security principal who creates a database, is considered the owner of that database and has all the rights to the database and its objects.

To give a security principal, such as a user or a security group, access to a database, provide the appropriate POSIX folder and file permissions to the underlying folders and files in the `warehouse` directory. For example, in order for a security principal to be able to read a table in a database, all the folders starting at the database folder in the `warehouse` directory need to have `X` and `R` permissions assigned to that security principal. In addition, files (such as the table's underlying data files) require `R` permissions. If a security principal requires the ability to create objects or drop objects in a database, additional `W` permissions are required on the folders and files in the `warehouse` folder.

## Examples

### Creating a Spark database and seeing it in SQL on-demand

[!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-preview-features](../../includes/synapse-analytics-preview-features.md)]

First create a new Spark database named `mytestdb` using a Spark cluster you have already created in your workspace. You can achieve that for example using a Spark C# Notebook with the following .NET for Spark statement:

```csharp
	spark.Sql("CREATE DATABASE mytestdb")
```

This creates the Spark database. After a short delay, you can see the database from SQL on-demand. For example, run the following statement from SQL on-demand.

```sql
	SELECT * FROM sys.databases;
```

Verify that `mytestdb` is included in the results.

### Exposing a Spark database in a SQL pool

[!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-preview-features](../../includes/synapse-analytics-preview-features.md)]

With the database created in the previous example, now create a SQL pool in your workspace named `mysqlpool` that enables metadata synchronization.

Run the following statement against the `mysqlpool` SQL pool:

```sql
	SELECT * FROM sys.schema;
```

Verify the schema for the newly created database in the results.
