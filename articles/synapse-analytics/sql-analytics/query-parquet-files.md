# Quickstart: Query Parquet files using SQL on-demand resources in SQL Analytics

In this article, you'll learn how to write a query using SQL on-demand resources that will read Parquet files.

## Prerequisites

Before reading rest of this article, review the following articles:
- [First-time setup](query-data-storage.md#first-time-setup)
- [Prerequisites](query-data-storage.md#prerequisites)


## Read Parquet files

You can query Parquet files the same way you read CSV files. The only difference is that the FILEFORMAT parameter should be set to PARQUET. Examples in this article show the specifics of reading Parquet files.

> [!NOTE]
> You do not have to specify columns in the OPENROWSET WITH clause when reading parquet files. SQL on-demand will utilize metadata in the Parquet file and bind columns by name.  

You'll use the folder *parquet/taxi* for the sample queries. It contains NYC Taxi - Yellow Taxi Trip Records data from July 2016. to June 2018.

Data is partitioned by year and month and the folder structure is as follows:

- year=2016
  - month=6
  - ...
  - month=12
- year=2017
  - month=1
  - ...
  - month=12
- year=2018
  - month=1
  - ...
  - month=6



### Read particular columns in Parquet files

You can specify only the columns of interest when you query Parquet files.

```sql
SELECT 
		YEAR(pickup_datetime),
		passenger_count,
		COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM  
	OPENROWSET(
		BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/parquet/taxi/*/*/*', 
		FORMAT='PARQUET'
	) WITH (
		pickup_datetime DATETIME2, 
		passenger_count INT
	) AS nyc
GROUP BY 
	passenger_count,
	YEAR(pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY
	YEAR(pickup_datetime),
	passenger_count
```

### Read Parquet files without specifying schema

You don't need to use the OPENROWSET WITH clause when reading Parquet files. Column names and data types are automatically read from Parquet files. 

The sample below shows the automatic schema inference capabilities for Parquet files. It returns the number of rows in September 2017 without specifying a schema. 

> [!NOTE]
> You don't have to specify columns in the OPENROWSET WITH clause when reading Parquet files. In that case, SQL on-demand Query service will utilize metadata in the Parquet file and bind columns by name.  

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT_BIG(*)
FROM  
	OPENROWSET(
		BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/parquet/taxi/year=2017/month=9/*.parquet',
		FORMAT='PARQUET'
	) AS nyc
```



### Target specific partitions using filepath function

You can target specific partitions using the filepath function. This example shows fare amounts by year, month, and payment_type for the first three months of 2017.

> [!NOTE]
> The SQL on-demand Query is compatible with Hive/Hadoop partitioning scheme.

```sql
SELECT 
	nyc.filepath(1) AS [year],
	nyc.filepath(2) AS [month],
	payment_type,
	SUM(fare_amount) AS fare_total
FROM  
	OPENROWSET(
		BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/parquet/taxi/year=*/month=*/*.parquet', 
		FORMAT='PARQUET'
	) AS nyc
WHERE 
	nyc.filepath(1) = 2017 
	AND nyc.filepath(2) IN (1, 2, 3)
	AND pickup_datetime BETWEEN CAST('1/1/2017' AS datetime) AND CAST('3/31/2017' AS datetime)
GROUP BY 
	nyc.filepath(1),
	nyc.filepath(2),
	payment_type
ORDER BY
	nyc.filepath(1),
	nyc.filepath(2),
	payment_type
```
