# Quickstart: Querying folders and multiple files

Reading this article you will learn how to write a query in SQL Analytics on-demand that will read from multiple files.

Reading multiple files/folders is supported through usage of wildcards, similar to wildcard used in Windows OS but with greater flexibility since multiple wildcards are allowed. Take a look at following sections for more details.

We will show how to query folders and multiple CSV files in following sections.

## Prerequisites

Before reading rest of the article make sure to check following articles:
- [First-time setup](query-data-storage.md#first-time-setup)
- [Prerequisites](query-data-storage.md#prerequisites)


## Read multiple files in folder

We will use folder *csv/taxi* for following sample queries. It contains NYC Taxi - Yellow Taxi Trip Records data from July 2016. to June 2018.

Files in *csv/taxi* are named after year and month:

- yellow_tripdata_2016-07.csv
- yellow_tripdata_2016-08.csv
- yellow_tripdata_2016-09.csv
- ...
- yellow_tripdata_2018-04.csv
- yellow_tripdata_2018-05.csv
- yellow_tripdata_2018-06.csv



Each file has the following structure:

![First 10 rows of the CSV file](./media/querying-folders-and-multiple-csv-files/nyc-taxi.png)



### Read all files in folder

This sample reads all NYC Yellow Taxi data files from *csv/taxi* folder and returns total number of passengers and rides per year. It also shows usage of aggregate functions.

```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(pickup_datetime) as [year],
	SUM(passenger_count) AS passengers_total,
	COUNT(*) AS [rides_total]
FROM OPENROWSET(
	BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/taxi/*.*',
		FORMAT = 'CSV', 
		FIRSTROW = 2
	)
	WITH (
		vendor_id VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2, 
		pickup_datetime DATETIME2, 
		dropoff_datetime DATETIME2,
		passenger_count INT,
		trip_distance FLOAT,
		rate_code INT,
		store_and_fwd_flag VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
		pickup_location_id INT,
		dropoff_location_id INT,
		payment_type INT,
		fare_amount FLOAT,
		extra FLOAT,
		mta_tax FLOAT,
		tip_amount FLOAT,
		tolls_amount FLOAT,
		improvement_surcharge FLOAT,
		total_amount FLOAT
	) AS nyc
GROUP BY 
	YEAR(pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY
	YEAR(pickup_datetime) 
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that all accessed files with single OPENROWSET must have the same structure (number of columns and their data types).



### Read subset of files in folder

This sample reads NYC Yellow Taxi data files for year 2017. from *csv/taxi* folder using wildcard and returns total fare amount per payment type.

```sql
SELECT 
	payment_type,  
	SUM(fare_amount) AS fare_total
FROM OPENROWSET(
	BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/taxi/yellow_tripdata_2017-*.csv',
		FORMAT = 'CSV', 
		FIRSTROW = 2
	)
	WITH (
		vendor_id VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2, 
		pickup_datetime DATETIME2, 
		dropoff_datetime DATETIME2,
		passenger_count INT,
		trip_distance FLOAT,
		rate_code INT,
		store_and_fwd_flag VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
		pickup_location_id INT,
		dropoff_location_id INT,
		payment_type INT,
		fare_amount FLOAT,
		extra FLOAT,
		mta_tax FLOAT,
		tip_amount FLOAT,
		tolls_amount FLOAT,
		improvement_surcharge FLOAT,
		total_amount FLOAT
	) AS nyc
GROUP BY payment_type
ORDER BY payment_type 

```

## Read folders

Path that you provide to OPENROWSET can be path to folder also. Following sections shows such queries.

### Read all files from specific folder

Although we can read all files in folder using file level wildcard as shown in [Read all files in folder](#read-all-files-in-folder), there is a way to query to folder and it will consume all files from particular folder. 

If path provided in OPENROWSET points to folder, all files in that folder will be used as source for our query.  Following query will read all files in *csv/taxi* folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Note existence of / at the end of path in query below. It denotes folder. If / is omitted, query will target file named *taxi* instead.

```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(pickup_datetime) as [year],
	SUM(passenger_count) AS passengers_total,
	COUNT(*) AS [rides_total]
FROM OPENROWSET(
	BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/taxi/',
		FORMAT = 'CSV', 
		FIRSTROW = 2
	)
	WITH (
		vendor_id VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2, 
		pickup_datetime DATETIME2, 
		dropoff_datetime DATETIME2,
		passenger_count INT,
		trip_distance FLOAT,
		rate_code INT,
		store_and_fwd_flag VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
		pickup_location_id INT,
		dropoff_location_id INT,
		payment_type INT,
		fare_amount FLOAT,
		extra FLOAT,
		mta_tax FLOAT,
		tip_amount FLOAT,
		tolls_amount FLOAT,
		improvement_surcharge FLOAT,
		total_amount FLOAT
	) AS nyc
GROUP BY 
	YEAR(pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY
	YEAR(pickup_datetime)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that all accessed files with single OPENROWSET must have the same structure (number of columns and their data types).

### Read all files from multiple folders

It is possible to read files from multiple folders with usage of wildcard. Following query will read all files from all folders located in *csv* folder, which names start with *t* and end with *i*.

> [!NOTE]
> Note existence of / at the end of path in query below. It denotes folder. If / is omitted, query will target files named *t&ast;i* instead.

```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(pickup_datetime) as [year],
	SUM(passenger_count) AS passengers_total,
	COUNT(*) AS [rides_total]
FROM OPENROWSET(
	BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/t*i/', 
		FORMAT = 'CSV', 
		FIRSTROW = 2
	)
	WITH (
		vendor_id VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2, 
		pickup_datetime DATETIME2, 
		dropoff_datetime DATETIME2,
		passenger_count INT,
		trip_distance FLOAT,
		rate_code INT,
		store_and_fwd_flag VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
		pickup_location_id INT,
		dropoff_location_id INT,
		payment_type INT,
		fare_amount FLOAT,
		extra FLOAT,
		mta_tax FLOAT,
		tip_amount FLOAT,
		tolls_amount FLOAT,
		improvement_surcharge FLOAT,
		total_amount FLOAT
	) AS nyc
GROUP BY 
	YEAR(pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY
	YEAR(pickup_datetime)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that all accessed files with single OPENROWSET must have the same structure (number of columns and their data types).

Since we have only one folder that matches criteria, the result of this query is the same as in [Read all files in folder](#read-all-files-in-folder).

## Multiple wildcards

We can use multiple wildcards on different levels of path. For example, we can enrich previous query to read files with 2017 data only, from all folders which names start with *t* and end with *i*.

> [!NOTE]
> Note existence of / at the end of path in query below. It denotes folder. If / is omitted, query will target files named *t&ast;i* instead.
> Note that there is a limit of maximum 10 wildcards per query.


```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(pickup_datetime) as [year],
	SUM(passenger_count) AS passengers_total,
	COUNT(*) AS [rides_total]
FROM OPENROWSET(
	BULK 'https://sqlondemandstorage.blob.core.windows.net/csv/t*i/yellow_tripdata_2017-*.csv',
		FORMAT = 'CSV', 
		FIRSTROW = 2
	)
	WITH (
		vendor_id VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2, 
		pickup_datetime DATETIME2, 
		dropoff_datetime DATETIME2,
		passenger_count INT,
		trip_distance FLOAT,
		rate_code INT,
		store_and_fwd_flag VARCHAR(100) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2,
		pickup_location_id INT,
		dropoff_location_id INT,
		payment_type INT,
		fare_amount FLOAT,
		extra FLOAT,
		mta_tax FLOAT,
		tip_amount FLOAT,
		tolls_amount FLOAT,
		improvement_surcharge FLOAT,
		total_amount FLOAT
	) AS nyc
GROUP BY 
	YEAR(pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY
	YEAR(pickup_datetime)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that all accessed files with single OPENROWSET must have the same structure (number of columns and their data types).

Since we have only one folder that matches criteria, the result of this query is the same as in [Read subset of files in folder](#read-subset-of-files-in-folder) and [Read all files from specific folder](#read-all-files-from-specific-folder). More complex scenarios of wildcard usage are covered in [Querying Parquet files](query-parquet-files.md).
