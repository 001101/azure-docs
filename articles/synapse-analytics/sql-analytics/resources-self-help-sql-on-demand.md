# Self-help for SQL On-demand

This article contains information about how to troubleshoot most frequent problems with SQL On-demand in Synapse

## SQL On-demand is grayed out in Synapse Studio

If Synapse Studio can't establish connection to SQL On-demand, you'll notice that SQL On-demand is grayed out or shows status "Offline". Usually, this problem occurs when one of the following cases happens:
1) Your network prevents communication to Synapse backend. Most frequent case is that port 1443 is blocked. To get the SQL On-demand to work unblock this port. Other problems could prevent SQL On-demand to work as well, [for more information read full troubleshooting guide](../troubleshoot/troubleshoot-synapse-studio.md)
2) You don't have permissions to log into SQL On-demand. To gain access, one of the Synapse workspace administrators should add you to workspace administrator or SQL administrator role. [For more information read full guide on access control](access-control.md).

## Failed to execute a query: File cannot be opened because it does not exist or it is used by another process.

If your query fails when with the error saying 'File cannot be opened because it does not exist or it is used by another process' and you're sure both file exist and it's not used by another process it means SQL On-demand can't access the file. This problem usually happens because your AAD identity doesn't have rights to access the file. By default, SQL On-demand is trying to access the file using your AAD identity. To resolve this issue, you need to have proper rights to access the file. Easiest way is to grant yourself 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' role on the storage account you're trying to query.
