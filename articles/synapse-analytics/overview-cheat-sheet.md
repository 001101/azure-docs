<!---Required: 
For the H1 - that's the primary heading at the top of the article - use the format "What is <service>?"
You can also use this in the TOC if your service name doesn’t cause the phrase to wrap.

## Concepts
| Nouns and verbs                         | What it does       |
|:---                                 |:---                 |
| **Synapse Workspace** | A securable collaboration boundary for doing cloud-based enterprise analytics in Azure. A workspace is deployed in a specific region and has an associated ADLSg2 account and file system (for storing temporary data). A workspace is under a resource group. |
| **SQL Analytics**   | Can do SQL Analytics with pools and with on-demand  |
| **SQL pool**   | 0-to-N SQL provisioned resources with their corresponding databases can be deployed in a workspace. Each SQL pool has an associated database. A SQL pool can be scaled, paused and resumed manually or automatically through Azure function. A SQL pool can scale from 100 DWU up to 30,000 DWU.       |
|**Spark** | Spark run-time used in a Spark pool. The current version supported is Spark 2.4 with Python 3.6.1, Scala 2.11.12, .Net Support for Apache Spark 0.5 and Delta Lake 0.3  | 
| **Spark pool**  | 0-to-N Spark provisioned resources with their corresponding databases can be deployed in a workspace. A Spark pool can auto-pause/resume/scale.  |
| **Spark application**  |   It consists of a driver process and a set of executor processes. A Spark application runs on a Spark pool.            |
| **Spark session**  |   Unified entry point of a spark application. It provides a way to interact with various spark’s functionality with a lesser number of constructs. To run a notebook, a session needs to be created. A session can be configured to run on a specific number of executors of a specific size. The default configuration for a notebook session is is to run on 2 executors of a medium size. |
| **SQL Request**  |   Operation such as a query run through a SQL pool or SQL On-Demand |
|**Data Integration**| Gives the capability to ingest data between various sources and orchestrate activities running within a workspace or outside a workspace| 
|**Artifacts**| Concept that encapsulates all objects necessary for a user to manage data sources, develop, orchestrate and visualize|
|**Notebook**| Interactive and reactive Data Science and Engineering interface supporting Scala, PySpark, C# and SparkSQL. |
|**Spark job definition**|Interface to submit a Spark job by with assembly jar containing the code and its dependencies|
|**Data Flow**|  Provides a fully visual experience with no coding required to do big data transformation. All optimization and execution are handled in a serverless fashion |
|**SQL script**| Set of SQL commands saved in a file. A SQL script can contain one or more SQL statements. It can be used to run SQL requests through SQL Analytics Pool or On-Demand.|
|**Pipeline**| Logical grouping of activities that together perform a task.|
|**Activity**| Defines actions to perform on data such as copying data, running a Notebook or a SQL script|
|**Trigger**| Executes a pipeline. It can be run manually or automatically (schedule, tumbling window or event-based)|
|**Linked service**| Connection strings that define the connection information needed for the workspace to connect to external resources|
|**Dataset**|  Named view of data that simply points or references the data to be used in an activity as input and output. It belongs to a Linked Service|
