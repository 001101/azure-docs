# Use .NET for Apache Spark with Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Synapse Analytics uses Apache Spark pools for data processing. Apache Sparkâ€¯is a general-purpose distributed processing engine for analytics over large data sets - typically terabytes or petabytes of data. You can use Apache Spark for several popular big data scenarios, including:

* Batch processing
* Machine Learning
* Impromptu querying

## What is .NET for Apache Spark

.NET for Apache Spark is free, open-source, and cross-platform .NET support for Spark. .NET for Apache Spark provides .NET bindings for Spark that allow you to access Spark APIs through C# and F#.

The .NET APIs for Spark enable you to access all aspects of Spark that help you analyze your data, including Spark SQL and Structured Streaming.

## .NET for Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics

You can analyze your data using .NET for Apache Spark through interactive Azure Synapse Analytics notebooks. When creating a new Azure Synapse Analytics notebook, you choose a language kernel that you wish to express your business logic. There is kernel support for several languages, including C#.

To use .NET for Apache Spark in your Azure Synapse Analytics notebook, select **Spark.NET C#** as your kernel and attach the notebook to an existing Apache Spark pool.

## .NET for Apache Spark scenarios

Notebooks are a great option for prototyping your .NET for Apache Spark pipelines and scenarios. You can start working with, understanding, filtering, displaying, and visualizing your data quickly and efficiently. Data engineers, data scientists, business analysts, and machine learning engineers are all able to collaborate over a shared, highly interactive document. You see immediate results from data exploration, and can visualize your data in the same notebook.

Azure Synapse Analytics notebooks provide a smooth tooling experience with minimal setup, and allow for quick prototyping of big data queries in C# as you learn and practice solving your problems with Apache Spark.

You can also develop a complete big data experience, such as reading in data, transforming it, and then exploring it through printed text or visualizing it through a plot or chart.

## Spark.NET C# kernel features

The following features are available when you use .NET for Apache Spark in the Azure Synapse Analytics notebook:

* Declarative HTML: Generate output from your cells using HTML-syntax, such as headers, bulleted lists, and even displaying images.
* Simple C# statements (such as assignments, printing to console, throwing exceptions, and so on).
* Multi-line C# code blocks (such as if statements, foreach loops, class definitions, and so on).
* Access to the standard C# library (such as System, LINQ, Enumerables, and so on).
* Support for [C# 8.0 language features](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8).
* 'spark' as a pre-defined variable to give you access to your Apache Spark session.
* Support for defining [.NET user-defined functions that can run within Apache Spark](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/blob/master/examples/Microsoft.Spark.CSharp.Examples/Sql).
* Support for visualizing output from your Spark jobs using different charts (such as line, bar, or histogram) and layouts (such as single, overlaid, and so on).
