# Getting Started with Azure Synapse Analytics
This tutorial guides leads developers through all the basic steps to needed to use Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Create a Synapse workspace
First, you need a Synapse workspace. Follow the steps in [Quickstart: Creating a new Synapse workspace](quickstart-create-workspace.md) to create a workspace.

## Launch Synapse Studio
Once your workspace is created, you can use Synapse Studio with it one of two ways:
* Open your Synapse workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and at the top of the Overview section click
* Go to https://web.azuresynapse.net and login to your workspace

## Create a SQL pool

* In Synapse Studio, on the left side click **Manage > SQL pools**
* Click **+New**
* For **SQL pool name** enter `SQLDB1`
* For **Performance level** use `DW100C`
* Click **Review+create**
* Click **Create**
* Your pool will be ready in a few minutes

## Create a Spark pool

* In Synapse Studio, on the left side click **Manage > Apache Sparke pools**
* Click **+New**
* For **Apache Spark pool name** enter `Spark1`
* For **Node size** select `Small`
* For **Number of nodes** set the minimum to 3 and the maximum to 3
* Click **Review+create**
* Click **Create**
* Your Spark pool will be ready in a few seconds

## Load the NYX Taxi Sample data into your SQL pool

* In Synapse Studio, it the topmost blue meny, click on the **?** icon.
* Select **Getting started > Getting started hub**
* In the card labelled **Query sample data** select the SQL pool `SQLDB1`
* Click **Query data**
* You will see a notification saying "Loading sample data". 
* NYXC taxi data tables are being loaded into SQLDB1 and this takes only a few minutes. Wait until it finishes.

## Explore the NYC taxi data in the SQL Pool

* In Synapse Studio, navigate to the **Data** hub
* Navigate to **SQLDB1 > Tables > dbo.Trip**
* Right-click on the **dbo.Trip** table and select **New SQL Script > Select TOP 100 Rows**
* A new SQL script will be created and automaticall run
* Notice that at the top of the SQL script **Connect to** is automatically set to the SQL pool called SQLDB1
* Replace the text of the SQL script with this code and run it.
    ```
    SELECT PassengerCount,
          SUM(TripDistanceMiles) as SumTripDistance,
          AVG(TripDistanceMiles) as AvgTripDistance
    FROM  dbo.Trip
    WHERE TripDistanceMiles > 0 AND PassengerCount > 0
    GROUP BY PassengerCount
    ORDER BY PassengerCount
    ```
* This query shows how the total trip distances and average trip distance relate to the number of passengers
* In the SQL scripts, result window select **Chart** to see a visualization of the results as a line chart

## Load the NYC data into a Spark Database

* In Synapse Studio, navigate to the **Develop hub"
* Click **+** and select **Notebook**
* At the top of the notebook, set the **Attach to** value to `Spark1`
* At the top of the notebook, set the **Language** to `Spark (Scala)`
* Click **Add code** to a notebook code cell and paste the text below:
    ```
    spark.sql("CREATE DATABASE nyctaxi")
    val df = spark.read.sqlanalytics("SQLDB1.dbo.Trip") 
    df.write.saveAsTable("nyctaxi.trip")
    ```
 * Navigate to the Data hub, right-click on Databases and select **Refresh**
 * Now you should see a Spark DB called nyxtaxi and inside that DB a table called trip
 
 ## Analyze the NYC Taxi data using Spark and notebooks
 * Return to your notebook
 * Create a new code cell and run this text
   ```
   %%pyspark
   df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM nyctaxi.trip") 
   df.show(10)
   ```
 * To show this in a nicer format run this code
   ```
   %%pyspark
   df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM nyctaxi.trip") 
   display(df)
   ```
 * Run this code to perform the same analysis we did earlier with the SQL pool
   ```
   %%pyspark
   df = spark.sql("""
      SELECT PassengerCount,
          SUM(TripDistanceMiles) as SumTripDistance,
          AVG(TripDistanceMiles) as AvgTripDistance
      FROM nyctaxi.trip
      WHERE TripDistanceMiles > 0 AND PassengerCount > 0
      GROUP BY PassengerCount
      ORDER BY PassengerCount
    """) 
    display(df)
    ```
 * In the cell results, click on **Chart** to see the data visualized
 
## Visualize data with Spark and notebooks

With spark notebooks you can control exactly how render charts. The following
code shows a simple example using the popular libraries matplotlib and seaborn.

    ```
    %%pyspark
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import pandas as pd

    sns.set(style = "whitegrid")

    df = spark.sql("""
        SELECT PassengerCount,
              SUM(TripDistanceMiles) as SumTripDistance,
              AVG(TripDistanceMiles) as AvgTripDistance
        FROM nyctaxi.trip
        WHERE TripDistanceMiles > 0 AND PassengerCount > 0
        GROUP BY PassengerCount
        ORDER BY PassengerCount
        """) 
    df = df.toPandas()
    sns.barplot(x="PassengerCount", y="AvgTripDistance", data = df)
    plt.show()
    ```
 
## Analytze NYX taxi data in Spark databases using SQL-on demand 

* Tables in Spark databases are automatically visible and queryable by SQL on-demand
* In Synapse Studio navigate to the Develop hub and create a new SQL script
* Set **Connect to** to **SQL on-demand** 
* Paste the following text into the script
    ```
    SELECT TOP 10 *
    FROM nyctaxi.dbo.trip
    ```
* Click **Run**
* NOTE: THe first time you run this it will take about 10 seconds for SQL on-demand to gather SQL resources needed to run
  your queries. Every subsequent query will not require this time.
  
  

## Use pipeline to orchestrate activities

You can orchestrate a wide variety of tasks in Azure Synapse. In this section, you'll see how easy it is.

* In Synapse Studio, navigate to the Orchestrate bug
* Click **+** then select **Pipeline**. A new pipeline will be created,
* Navigate to the Develop hub and find any  of the notebooks you previously created
* Drag that notebook into the pipeline
* In the pipeline click **Add trigger > New/edit**
* In** Choose trigger** click **New**, and then in Recurrence set the trigger to run every 1 hour.
* Click **OK**
* Click **Publish All** and the pipeline will run every hour
* If you want to make the pipeline run now without waiting for the next hour click **Add trigger > New/edit**

## Monitor activites

* In Synapse Studio, Navigate to the monitor hub.
* In this location you can see a history of all the activites taking place in the workspace and which ones are active now.
* Explore the **Pipeline runs**, **Apache Spark applications**, and **SQL requests** and you can see what you've already done in the workspace.




### Visualize with Power BI
 Your data can now be easily analyzed and visualized in Power BI. Synapse offers a unique integration which allows you to link a Power BI workspace to you Synapse workspace. Before going forward, follow the steps in this [quickstart](quickstart-power-bi.md) to link your Power BI workspace.
On the **Develop** hub, expand your linked workspace under **Power BI** and click on **Power BI Datasets**.

![View Power BI datasets](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-view-datasets.png)

Any existing datasets from you linked Power BI workspace will be displayed here. You can create new reports in Synapse Studio using these Power BI datasets. Letâ€™s create a new Power BI dataset for the database which we created in the last section. Click **+ New Power BI dataset**. 

![New Power BI datasets](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-new-dataset.png)

While Power BI reports can be created in Synapse Studio, Power BI datasets must be created in the Power BI Desktop. Install the Power BI Desktop if you have not already and then click **Start** once the installation is complete.

![Download Power BI Desktop](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-download-desktop.png)

Select **NYCTaxiVirtual** and click continue.

![Select database to use](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-select-database.png)

Click **Download** to download the Power BI dataset file (pbids). Open the file when the download is complete to launch the Power BI Desktop. Once the Power BI Desktop has been launched, sign into Synapse by using your Azure Active Directory user account. Then click **Connect**.

![Sign into Synapse](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-sign-in.png)

Select all the views to include in your Power BI dataset and click **Load**.

![Select all views in the navigator](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-navigator.png)

Select **DirectQuery** and click **OK**.

![Select DirectQuery](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-directquery.png)

Click on the **Model** view and create relationships between the three tables by dragging **DateID** from **Trips** and dropping it on **DateID** in **dimDate**. 

![Create relationships](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-create-relationship.png)

Click **Assume referential integrity** and click **OK**.

![Setup relationship](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-ref-integrity.png)

Create another relationship by dragging **PickupGepgraphyID** from **Trips** and dropping it on **GeographyID** on **dimGeography**. Select **Assume referential integrity** like in the last step. Your model diagram should now look something like below.

![Relationship diagram](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-diagram.png)

Go back to the **Report** view and right-click on the **Trips** table and click on **New Measure**.

![New measure](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-new-measure.png)

Enter the following DAX formula into the formula bar and press enter.
```dax
Average fair per trip = DIVIDE(
                                SUM(Trips[TotalAmount])
                                ,COUNTROWS(Trips)
                            )
```

![Formula bar](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-formula.png)

Save the Power BI File and publish it to the Power BI workspace that you linked to Synapse.

![Publish to workspace](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-publish.png)

After publishing, go to the **Settings** page for your Power BI dataset inside of your Power BI workspace.

![Dataset settings](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-find-dataset-settings.png)

Under **Data source credentials** hit **Edit credentials**.

![Edit credentials](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-edit-credentials.png)

Change the **Authentication method** to **OAuth2** and click **Sign in**. Sign in with your Azure Active Directory Account.

![Sign into Synapse](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-web-sign-in.png)

After publishing, switch back to Synapse Studio and click **Close and refresh**.

![Close and refresh](./media/get-started-synapse-analytics/pbi-close-refresh.png)

Click **New Power BI report** next to the name of the Power BI dataset that you just published. Now you can build out your Power BI report direction in Synapse Studio. Donâ€™t forget to save the report when you are finished creating it.
