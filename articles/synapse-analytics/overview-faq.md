## General
### Q: What is Azure Synapse Analytics
A: Azure Synapse is an integrated data platform for BI, AI, and continuous intelligence. It connects various Analytics runtimes such as SQL and Spark through a single platform that provides a unified way to:
- Secure your analytics resources: network, managing single sign-on  access to pool, data, and development artifacts.
- Easily Monitor and quickly optimize, react and debug  events happening in your workspace activities at any layer
- Manage your metadata across engines. Create a Spark table and it will be automatically available in your SQL Analytics databases
- Interact with the data through a unified user experience. Synapse Studio brings Big Data Developers, Data Engineers, DBAs, Data Analysts and Data Scientists on the same platform.

### Q: How do I get started with Azure Synapse Analytics?
A: To start using Azure Synapse Analytics, create a Synapse workspace (it is free!) and create the resources that you want under that workspace. You can follow one of our quickstart tutorials that will walk you through simple use case. You can also find sample notebooks and SQL scripts into our repository. If you need to connect to public dataset, create a new linked service with the following attributes:
- azure_storage_account_name = "azureopendatastorage"
- azure_storage_sas_token = "" (write **""**)

### Q: What are the main components of Azure Synapse Analytics?
A: Azure Synapse has the following capabilities:
- SQL Analytics to do SQL Analytics with pools and with on-demand (Serverless). 
- Spark with full support for Scala, Python, SparkSQL and C#
- Data Flow offering a code-free big data transformation experience
- Data Integration & Orchestration to bring your data and operationalize all of your code development
- Studio to access all of these capabilities through a single Web UI

### Q: How does Azure Synapse Analytics relate to Azure SQL Data Warehouse?
A: Azure Synapse Analytics is an evolution of Azure SQL Data Warehouse into an analytics platform. This platform combines data exploration, ingestion, transformation, preparation and serving analytics layer.  

## Use cases
### Q: What is a good use case for SQL Analytics Pool in Synapse

A: SQL Analytics Pool is the heart of your data warehouse needs. It is the leading data warehouse solution in [price/performance](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-data-warehouse/compare/). SQL Analytics Pool is the industry-leading cloud data warehouse solution because you can:
- serve a large and mixed variety of workloads without impact in performance thanks to high concurrency and workload isolation
- secure your data easily through advanced features ranging from network security to fine-grain access
- benefit from a wide range of eco-system 

### Q: What is a good use case for Spark in Synapse

A: Our first goal is to provide a great Data Engineering experience for transforming data over the lake in batch or stream. Its tight and simple integration to our data orchestration makes the operationalization of your development work straightforward.

Another use case for Spark is for a Data Scientist to:
- extract a feature
- explore data
- train a model

### Q: What is a good use case for SQL Analytics On-Demand in Synapse

A: SQL Analytics Pool, previously called SQL Data Warehouse,  is a great tool for exploring the data with T-SQL. It is also a great tool for running Business Intelligence at a low cost if data is accessed infrequently. Another sue case is to provide a low-cost BI interface into the lake. You can combine Power BI and SQL Analytics On-Demand to cache data that are accessed frequently and use SQL On-Demand, a serverless query engine, to access the lake infrequently.

### Q: What is a good use case for data flow in Synapse

A: Data flow allows data engineers to develop graphical data transformation logic without writing code. The resulting data flows are executed as activities within Data Integration & Orchestration. Data flow activities can be operationalized via existing scheduling, control, flow and monitoring capabilities.

## Security and Access
### Q: What is the primary way to authenticate and give access to users 

A: End to end single sign-on experience is important in Azure Synapse Analytics. Therefore, managing and passing through the identity through a full AAD integration is a must. 

### Q: How do I get access to files and folders in the ADLSg2?

A: Access to files and folders is currently managed through ADLSg2. For more information, visit the page [here](../storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control.md).

### Q: Can I use third-party business intelligence tools to access Azure Synapse Analytics?

A: Yes, you can use your third-party business applications, like Tableau and Power BI, to connect to SQL Analytics pool and SQL Analytics On-Demand. Spark supports IntelliJ.

### Q: Does Azure Synapse Analytics provide APIs?

A: Yes, we provide an SDK to programmatically interact to Azure Synapse Analytics. More information is available [here] on which operations are supported by Synapse.
