# Azure Security Baseline for Synapse Analytics

The Azure Security Baseline for Synapse Analytics contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/5435).

**Guidance**: Secure your Azure SQL Server to a virtual network via Private Link. Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network. You can also narrow the scope if inbound and outbound connections by configuring a network security group (NSG) and associating that with your virtual network.

Alternatively, for any virtual machines (VM) connecting to a SQL Database inside your Synapse Analytics pool, narrow down the scope of outgoing connection to the SQL Database by using a network security group. Disable all Azure service traffic to SQL Database via the public endpoint by setting Allow Azure Services to OFF. Ensure no IP addresses are allowed in the server and database level firewall rules.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/5436).

**Guidance**: For Azure Virtual Machines (VM) that will be connecting to your Azure SQL Database Server instance, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs for the NSGs protecting those VMs and send logs into a Azure Storage Account for traffic auditing.

You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/5442).

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags  to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

When using a service endpoint for an Azure SQL Database in your SQL Synapse pool, outbound to Azure SQL Database Public IP addresses is required: Network Security Groups (NSGs) must be opened to Azure SQL Database IPs to allow connectivity. You can do this by using NSG service tags for Azure SQL Database.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/5443).

**Guidance**: Define and implement network security configurations for resources related to your SQL Analytics pool with Azure Policy. You may use the "Microsoft.Sql" namespace to define custom policy definitions, or use any of the built-in policy definitions designed for Azure SQL Database/Server network protection. An example of an applicable built-in network security policy for Azure SQL Database server would be: "SQL Server should use a virtual network service endpoint".
 
Use Azure Blueprints to simplify large scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Management templates, role-based access control (RBAC), and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/5471).

**Guidance**: For any Azure SQL Database in your Synapse SQL pool storing or processing sensitive information, mark the database and related resources as sensitive using tags. Configure Private Link in conjunction with network security group (NSG) service tags on your Azure SQL Database instances to prevent the exfiltration of sensitive information.

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and goes to great lengths to guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/5476).

**Guidance**: Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics against the threat of malicious offline activity by encrypting data at rest. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application. By default, TDE is enabled for all newly deployed Azure SQL databases. In Azure, the default setting for transparent data encryption is that the database encryption key is protected by a built-in server certificate -- however, you do have the option to encrypt the Database Encryption Key with your own, customer-managed key if necessary.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/5517).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to alerts, to help you prioritize the order in which you attend to each alert, so that when a resource is compromised, you can get to it right away. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.
