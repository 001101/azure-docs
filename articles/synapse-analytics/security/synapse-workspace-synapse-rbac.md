# What is Synapse role-based access control (RBAC)?

Synapse RBAC extends the capabilities of [Azure RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) for Synapse workspaces and their content. Azure RBAC is used to manage who can create, update, or delete the Synapse workspace and the Azure resources it contains:
- SQL pools, 
- Apache Spark pools, 
- Integration runtimes. 

Synapse RBAC is used to manage who can
- publish code artifacts and list or access published code artifacts, 
- execute code on Apaches Spark pools and Integration runtimes,
- access linked (data) services protected by credentials 
- monitor or cancel job execution, review job output, and execution logs.  

>[!Note]
>While Synapse RBAC is used to manage access to published SQL scripts, Synapse RBAC is _not_ used to control access to dedicated SQL pools or allow execution of SQL scripts in dedicated SQL Pools, which is managed using SQL security.

## What can I do with Synapse RBAC?

Here are some examples of what you can do with Synapse RBAC:
  - Allow a user to publish changes made to Apache Spark notebooks and jobs to the live service.
  - Allow a user to run and cancel notebooks and spark jobs on a specific Apache Spark pool.
  - Allow a user to use specific credentials so they can run pipelines secured by the workspace system identity and access linked services secured with credentials. 
  - Allow an administrator to manage, monitor, and cancel job execution on specific Spark Pools.    

## How Synapse RBAC works
Like Azure RBAC, Synapse RBAC works by creating role assignments. A role assignment consists of three elements: a security principal, a role definition, and a scope.  

### Security Principals

A _security principal_ is a user, group, service principal, or managed identity.

### Roles
 
A _role_ is a collection of permissions or actions that can be performed on specific resource types or artifact types. Actions may be generic and apply to different kinds of resources or artifacts.  Type-specific actions apply only to certain resource types or artifact types.

Synapse provides built-in roles that define collections of actions that match the needs of different personas:
- Administrators can get full access to create and configure a workspace 
- Developers can create, update and debug SQL scripts, notebooks, pipelines, and dataflows, but not be able to publish or execute this code on production compute resources/data
- Operators can monitor and manage system status, application execution and review logs, without access to code or the outputs from execution.
- Security staff can manage and configure endpoints without having access to code, compute resources or data.

[Learn more](./synapse-workspace-rbac-roles.md) about the built-in Synapse roles. 

Future releases of Synapse Analytics will allow custom roles to be defined.

### Scopes

A _scope_ defines the resources or artifacts that the access applies to.  Synapse supports hierarchical scopes.  Permissions granted at a higher-level scope are inherited by objects at a lower level.  In Synapse RBAC, the top-level scope is a workspace.  Assigning a role with workspace scope grants permissions to all applicable objects in the workspace.  

Current supported scopes within a workspace are: Apache Spark pool, Integration runtime, linked service, and credential. 

Access to code artifacts is granted with workspace scope.  Granting access to collections of artifacts within a workspace will be supported in a later release.

## Role assignments roles and computing permissions

A role assignment grants the principal the permissions defined by the role at the specified scope.

Synapse RBAC is an additive model like Azure RBAC. Multiple roles may be assigned to a single principal and at different scopes. When computing the permissions of a security principal, the system considers all roles assigned to the principal and to groups that directly or indirectly include the principal.  It also considers the scope of each assignment in determining the permissions that apply.  

## Enforcing assigned permissions

In Synapse Studio, if you don't have the required permissions, specific buttons or options may be grayed out or an error will be returned.  If a button or option is disabled, hovering over the button or option shows a tooltip with the required permission.  You'll need to contact a Synapse Administrator to assign a role that grants the required permission. You can see the roles required to grant specific actions [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148305).

## Who can assign Synapse RBAC roles?

Only a Synapse Administrator is able to assign Synapse RBAC roles.  A Synapse Administrator at the workspace level can grant access at any scope, while a Synapse Administrator at a lower-level scope can only grant access at that scope. 

When a new workspace is created, the creator is automatically given the Synapse Administrator role at workspace scope.   

## Where do I manage Synapse RBAC?

Synapse RBAC is managed from within Synapse Studio using the Access control tools in the Manage hub.
