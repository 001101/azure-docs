# Synapse RBAC Roles

The article explains the built-in Synapse RBAC roles and when you would use each.  

## Built-in Synapse RBAC roles

The following table describes the permissions of each built-in role and the scopes at which these roles can be used.

> [!Note]
> - Users with any Synapse RBAC role at any scope automatically have the Synapse Reader role at workspace scope
>- The Apache Spark Administrator and SQL Administrator roles are deprecated and can no longer be used in new role assignments.  Although deprecated, these roles are updated to the Synapse RBAC model. These roles are highlighted with an '*' in the tables below.
>- Where 'future' permissions are noted for a role below, these permissions will be added to the role in a later release and will automatically apply to all principals with that role. 

|Role |Permissions|Scopes|
|---|---|---|
| Synapse Administrator  |Full Synapse access to all resources (SQL Pools, Apache Spark Pools, Integration Runtimes) and code artifacts, including granting access.  Includes administrative access to SQL Pools.</br></br>_Can read and write artifacts.</br> Can do all actions on Spark activities.</br> Can view Spark pool logs.</br> Can view saved notebook and pipeline output. </br> Can use the secrets stored by linked services or credentials.
