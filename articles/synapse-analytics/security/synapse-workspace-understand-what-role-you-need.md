# Understand the roles required to perform common tasks in Synapse

This article will help you understand which Synapse RBAC (role-based access control) or Azure RBAC roles you need to get work done in Synapse Studio.  

## Synapse Studio access control and workflow summary 

### Accessing Synapse Studio
- You can open Synapse Studio on a Synapse workspace if you have been assigned any Synapse RBAC role on the workspace or any of its content, or if you have Azure Owner, Contributor, or Reader roles on the workspace. 

### Resource management
- You can list and view details of the workspace or any of its Azure resources (SQL pools, Spark pools, or integration runtimes) if you're an Azure Owner, Contributor, or Reader on the workspace or have been assigned any Synapse RBAC role.
- You can create SQL pools, Apache Spark pools, integration runtimes if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the workspace.
- You can pause or scale dedicated SQL pools, configure Spark pools or integration runtimes if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the workspace or a specific resource.

### Editing code artifacts

- With access to Synapse Studio, you can create new code artifacts, such as SQL scripts, notebooks, spark jobs, linked services, pipelines, dataflows, triggers, and credentials.  (These artifacts can be published or saved with additional permissions.)  
- If you're a Synapse Artifact Reader, Synapse Artifact Author, Synapse Contributor, or Synapse Administrator you can list, open, and edit already published code artifacts.

### Executing your code

- You can execute SQL scripts on SQL pools if you have the necessary SQL permissions defined in those SQL pools.  
- You can run notebooks and Spark jobs if you have Synapse Compute Manager permissions on the workspace or specific Apache Spark pools.  
- With compute usage on the workspace of specific integration runtimes and appropriate credential permissions you can execute pipelines and the activities orchestrated within them.

### Monitoring and managing execution
- You can review the status of running notebooks and jobs in Apache Spark pools if you're a Synapse Reader.
- You can review logs and cancel running jobs and pipelines if you're a Synapse Compute Manager at the workspace or for a specific Spark pool or pipeline.  

### Publishing and saving your code

- You can publish new or updated code artifacts to the service if you're a Synapse Artifact Author, Synapse Contributor, or Synapse Administrator. 
- You can commit/save code artifacts to a working branch of your configured repository if the workspace is Git-enabled and you have Git permissions. With Git enabled, publishing to the service is only recommended from the collaboration branch. 
- If you close Synapse Studio without publishing or committing any changes you've made to any code artifacts, then those changes will be lost.


## Tasks and required roles

The table below lists common tasks and for each task, the Synapse RBAC, or Azure RBAC roles required. Tasks are grouped by analytics runtime, and then organized into resource management and monitoring, code editing, code execution, code publishing, and saving.   

>[!Note]
>- Synapse Administrator is not listed for each task unless it is the only role that provides the necessary permission.  A Synapse Administrator can perform all tasks enabled by other Synapse RBAC roles.</br>
>- All Synapse RBAC roles at any scope provide you Synapse Reader permissions at the workspace
>- All Synapse RBAC permissions/actions shown in the table are prefixed microsoft/synapse/workspaces/... </br>
