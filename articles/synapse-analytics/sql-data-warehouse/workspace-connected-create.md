# Creating a Workspace for existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW)

All  SQL data warehouse customers can now access and use an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instance via the Synapse Studio and Workspace, without impacting automation, connections or tooling. 

This article explains how an existing Azure Synapse Analytics customer can create a Synapse workspace for and existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) to build and expand their existing Analytics solution by taking advantage of the new feature rich capabilities now available via the Synapse workspace and Studio.   

# Prerequisites
Before you begin creating your new workspace you must ensure that you have the following
- Rights to create and manage the SQL resources hosted on the SQL logical server.
- Rights to create Synapse resources.
- An Azure Active Directory admin identified on the logical server

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Create a Synapse workspace for an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW)

A Synapse workspace can be created on any existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) in a supported region. This capability is only available via the Azure portal.

Follow these steps to create a Synapse workspace for you existing data warehouse.
1. Select an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) and open the overview page.
2. Select **New Synapse workspace** in the top menu bar or the message immediately below.

3. After reviewing the list of data warehouses that will be made available via the new Synapse workspace on the **Create new Azure Synapse workspace** page. Select **Continue** to proceed.
> [!NOTE]
> All dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instances hosted on the logical server will be available via the new workspace 
4. On the **Basics** page the existing dedicated SQL pool (the **Project** details section should be pre-populated with the same **Subscription** and **Resource group** that the logical server is deployed under. And under **Workspace details** the **Workspace** name is pre-populated with the same name and region of the SQL logical server. This is done to ensure the connection between your new Synapse workspace and the logical server can be created during provisioning process. Post provisioning this connection must be retained to ensure continued access to the dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instances via the workspace and Studio.

5. Navigate to Select Data Lake Storage Gen 2.
6. Click **Create new** or select an existing **Data Lake Storage Gen2** before then click **Next: Networking**.
7. Choose a **SQL administrator password** for your **Serverless instance**. Changing this password does not update or change the logical server SQL credentials. If you prefer a system defined password leave these fields empty. This password can be change at anytime within the new workspace. The admin name must be the same used on the SQL Server.
8. Select your preferred **Networking settings** and click **Review + Create** to start workspace provisioning.
9. Select **Goto resource** to open your new workspace.

## Post provisioning steps
The following steps must be completed to ensure that your existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instances can be accessed via the Synapse Studio.
1. In the Synapse workspace overview page select **Connected server**, this will take you to the connected SQL Logical server that hosts you data warehouses. In the essential menu select **Connected server**.
2. Open **Firewalls and virtual networks** and ensure that your client IP or a pre determined IP range has access to the logical server.
3. Open **Active Directory admin** and ensure that an AAD admin has been set on the logical server.
4. Select one of the dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) instances hosted on the logical server. In the overview page select **Launch Synapse Studio** or Go to the [Sign in to the Synapse Studio](https://web.azuresynapse.net) and sign in to your workspace.

5. Open the **Data hub** and expand the dedicated SQL pool in the Object explorer to ensure that you have can access and query your data warehouse.
