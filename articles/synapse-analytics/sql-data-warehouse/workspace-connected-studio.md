# Using Synapse Studio to access and use an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW)

Once you have created a connected workspace in Azure Portal, click Open Synapse Studio card in the overview blade. You will be redirected to Synapse Studio. You will be able to benefit from the Synapse Studio workspace experience including the following features:

Analyze using a dedicated and serverless pool and leverage SQL script, Data hub and storage explorer, create a Spark pool and analyze using Synapse Notebook, use pipelines with store procedures and copy data leveraging a wide variety of linked services with Integrate hub, visualize with Power BI,  monitor your SQL requests. 

You will also be able to become quickly productive with the available Azure Open Datasets and samples code in the Knowledge center.

Try https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/get-started. It is important to be aware of a few differences you will experience when using a 
connected workspace instead of a new Synapse workspace. When creating a new SQL pool you will be re-directed to Azure portal where you will be able to complete the pool creation. In the Knowledge Center available on your Home hub clicking on the Learn card, you will not be able to create new dedicated SQL pools but use existing pools. The Monitoring hub will.
