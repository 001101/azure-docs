# Score machine learning models with PREDICT

Synapse SQL provides you the capability to score machine learning models using the familiar T-SQL language. With T-SQL [PREDICT](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest), you can bring your existing machine learning models trained in historical data and score them within the secure boundaries of your data warehouse. PREDICT function takes an [ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)](https://onnx.ai/) model and data as inputs. Predictions are generated based on the model. This feature eliminates the step of moving valuable data outside the data warehouse for scoring. It aims to empower data professionals to easily deploy machine learning models with the familiar T-SQL interface as well as collaborate seamlessly with data scientists working with the right framework for their task.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is currently not supported in SQL on-demand.

The functionality requires that the model is trained outside of Synapse SQL. After building the model, load it into the data warehouse and score it with the T-SQL Predict syntax to get insights from the data.

## Training the Model

Synapse SQL expects a pre-trained model. Keep the following factors in mind when training a machine learning model that is used for performing predictions in Synapse SQL.

- Synapse SQL only supports ONNX format models. ONNX is an open-source model format that allows you to exchange models between various frameworks to enable interoperability. You can convert your existing models to ONNX format using frameworks that either support it natively or have converting packages available. For example, [sklearn-onnx](https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx) is a tool to convert sciket-learn models to ONNX. [Here](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials#converting-to-onnx-format) is a list of supported frameworks and examples.

   If you are using [Automated ML](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml) for training, make sure to set the *enable_onnx_compatible_models* parameter to TRUE to produce an ONNX format model. For an example of a tutorial showing how to use AutoML to create a machine learning model with ONNX format, see the [Automated Machine Learning Notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/classification-bank-marketing-all-features/auto-ml-classification-bank-marketing-all-features.ipynb).

- The following data types are supported:
    - int, bigint, real, float
    - char, varchar, nvarchar

- The scoring data needs to be in the same format as the training data. Complex data types such as multi-dimensional arrays are not supported by PREDICT. So, for training make sure that each inputs of the model correspond to a single column for the scoring table instead of passing a single array containing all inputs.

- Make sure that the names and data types of the model inputs match the column names of the new prediction data. Visualizing an ONNX model using various open-source tools available online can further help with debugging.

## Loading the model

The model is stored in a Synapse SQL user table as a hexadecimal string with varbinary(max) data type. Additional columns such as ID and description can be added in the model table to identify the model. Here is a code example for a table that can be used for storing models:

```sql
-- Sample table schema for storing a model and related data
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Models]
(
    [Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [Model] [varbinary](max) NULL,
    [Description] [varchar](200) NULL
)
WITH
(
    DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN,
    HEAP
)
GO

```

Once the model is converted to a hexadecimal string and the table definition specified, use the [COPY command](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/copy-into-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest) or Polybase to load the model in the Synapse SQL table. The following code sample uses the Copy command to load the model.

```sql
-- Copy command to load hexadecimal string of the model from Azure Data Lake storage location
COPY INTO [Models] (Model)
FROM '<enter your storage location>'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Shared Access Signature', SECRET='<enter your storage key here>')
)
```

## Scoring the model

Once the model and data are loaded, use the T-SQL **PREDICT** function to score the model. Make sure that the new input data for predictions is in the same format as the training data used for building the model. T-SQL PREDICT takes two inputs: model and new scoring input data, and generates new columns for the output. In the example below, an additional column with name *Score* and data type *float* is created containing the prediction results. All the input data columns as well as output prediction columns are available for the select statement. For more details, see [PREDICT (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest).

```sql
-- Query for ML predictions
SELECT d.*, p.Score
FROM PREDICT(MODEL = (SELECT Model FROM Models WHERE Id = 1),
DATA = dbo.mytable AS d) WITH (Score float) AS p;
```
