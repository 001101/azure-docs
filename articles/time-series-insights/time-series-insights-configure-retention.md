# Configure data retention in Azure Time Series Insights

Time Series Insights can store data for up to 400 days and Time Series Insights enables two modes for managing ingress and data purge settings when the capacity of an environment is reached.  These two modes are **continue ingress and purge old data** and **pause ingress**.  The default setting, and the only option available when creating a new environment, is **continue ingress and purge old data**. From experience and customer interaction, we expect most will want to use this setting, which optimizes for the freshest data.  However, you can toggle between these modes in the configuration for of an existing environment. 

## Continue ingress and purge old data

**Continue ingress** is the default mode for Time Series Insights environments and exhibits the same behavior Time Series Insights environments did in public preview. Use **Continue ingress** if you want to always see the most recent data in your Time Series Insights environment, and if you are comfortable with data being purged once the environment’s limits (size, count, or time, whichever comes first) are reached. Retention is set to 30 days by default.

Time Series Insights purges the oldest ingested data first (FIFO approach).

To illustrate **continue ingress** behavior, examine an environment that  provisions a single unit of S1 and pushes 500 MB each day. If retention is set to 400 days, this environment will only see 60 days of data, as it hits its maximum capacity after 60 days (1 S1 unit contains 30 GB of total capacity.  500 MB x 60 = 30 GB).  On the 61st day, the environment displays fresh data, but purges data older than 60 days to accommodate the new data streaming in.  If you want to retain data for a longer period of time, you can increase the size of the environment by adding additional units or you can push less data.  

As an alternative example, examine an environment that is configured to retain data for 180 days with one S1 unit.  To store data for 180 days, that environment cannot exceed daily ingress of 0.166 GB (166 MB) per day.  If the environment’s daily ingress rate exceeds 0.166 GB per day, data will not be stored for 180 days.  For example, if the environment’s ingress rate averages 0.189 GB per day, it would realize just over 158 days of retention (30 GB/0.189 = 158.73 days of retention).  

## Pause ingress

The **pause ingress** mode is for users who need to ensure their data is not purged if the size and count limits are reached prior to their retention period.  It provides additional time for the users to increase the capacity of their environment before data is purged due to breaching of retention period.  Enabling this mode helps to protect from data loss. Once an environment’s maximum capacity is reached, the environment pauses data ingress until either:

- The environment’s maximum capacity is increased by adding more units. For more information, see [Plan your Time Series Insights environment](time-series-insights-environment-planning.md). 
- The retention period is reached and data is purged, thus bringing the environment below its maximum capacity.
 
 To illustrate **pause ingress** behavior, examine an environment that provisions as three units of S1, pushes 2 GB each day, and where the retention period is configured to 60 days.  This environment  pauses ingress when the maximum capacity is reached,  and only shows the same data set until ingress resumes or **continue ingress** is enabled (which purges older data to make room for new data).  

When ingress resumes:
- Data flows in the order it was received by event source
- The events are indexed based on their timestamp, unless you have exceeded retention policies on your event source.  For more information on event source retention configuration, see [Event Hubs frequently asked questions](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-reference-query-syntax).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should set alerts to avoid a pause in ingress. Because the default retention is 24 hours for Azure event sources, you can and likely will lose fresher data if you do not increase capacity or switch to **continue ingress and purge** mode.

- If you do not configure properties on the event source (timeStampPropertyName), Time Series Insights defaults to the timestamp of arrival at event hub as the X axis.  If **timeStampPropertyName** is configured to be something different, the environment looks for the configured **timeStampPropertyName** in the data packet when Time Series Insights parses events.
 
Device-to-cloud messages are durable and retained in an IoT Hub's default messages/events endpoint for up to seven days. For more information, see [Send device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c).
