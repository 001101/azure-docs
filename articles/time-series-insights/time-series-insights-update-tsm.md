This document details Time Series Model (tsm) part of Time Series Insights update. It describes the model itself, its capabilities, and how to get started building and updating your own model.

Traditionally the data collected from IoT devices lacks contextual information, thus making it difficult to find and analyze sensors quickly with less efforts. Our main motivation for tsm is to make it easy to find and analyze IoT data by enabling curation, maintenance, and enrichment of time series data to help establish consumer-ready data sets. Time Series Model plays a vital role in queries and navigation as it contextualizes device and non-device entities. Data persisted in tsm powers time series queries computations by leveraging the formulas stored in them.
