# Tutorial: Set up an Azure Time Series Insights Preview environment

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating an Azure Time Series Insights pay-as-you-go (PAYG) Preview environment. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

* Create a Time Series Insights Preview environment.
* Connect the Time Series Insights Preview environment to an event hub in Azure Event Hubs.
* Run a wind farm simulation to stream data into the Time Series Insights Preview environment.
* Perform basic analysis on the data.
* Define a Time Series Model type and hierarchy and associate it with your instances.

# Create a device simulation

In this section, you will create three simulated devices will send data to an IoT Hub.

1. Go to the [Azure IoT solution accelerators home page](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators). The Azure IoT solution accelerators home page displays several pre-built examples. Sign in using your Azure account. Then, select **Device Simulation**.

   ![Azure IoT solution accelerators home page][1]

   Lastly, click **Try Now**.

1. Enter the required parameters on the **Create Device Simulation** solution page:

   | Parameter | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Solution name |	A unique value, used for creation of a new resource group. The listed Azure resources are | created and assigned to the resource group. |
   | Subscription |	Specify the same subscription used for creation of your TSI environment |
   | Region |	Specify the same region used for creation of your TSI. |
   | Deploy optional Azure Resources	| Leave IoT Hub checked, as the simulated devices will use it to connect/stream data. |

   After entering the required parameters, click on **Create Solution**. Wait for approximately 10-15 minutes for your solution to be deployed.

   ![Create device simulation solution][2]

## Create a Time Series Insights Preview PAYG environment

This section describes how to create a Time Series Insights Preview environment by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Sign in to the Azure portal by using your subscription account.

1. Select **Create a resource**.

1. Select the **Internet of Things** category, and then select **Time Series Insights**.

   ![Select Create a resource, then select Internet of Things, and then select Time Series Insights][9]

1. Fill the fields on the page as follows:

   | | |
   | --- | ---|
   | **Environment name** | Choose a unique name for the Azure Time Series Insights Preview environment. |
   | **Subscription** | Enter your subscription where you want to create the Azure Time Series Insights Preview environment. It is a best practice to use the same subscription as the rest of your IoT resources created by the device simulator. |
   | **Resource Group** | A resource group is a container for Azure resources. Choose an existing resource group, or create a new one, for the Azure Time Series Insights Preview environment resource. It is a best practice to use the same resource group as the rest of your IoT resources created by the device simulator. |
   | **Location** | Choose a data center region for your Azure Time Series Insights Preview environment. To avoid added bandwidth costs and latency, it's best to keep the Azure Time Series Insights Preview environment in the same region as other IoT resources. |
   | **Tier** |  Select `PAYG` which stands for pay-as-you-go. This is the SKU for Azure Time Series Insights Preview product. |
   | **Property ID** | Property Id uniquely identifies your time series. Please not that this field is immutable and cannot be changed later. For this tutorial set the field to `iothub-connection-device-id`. To learn more about Time Series ID, read [How to choose a Time Series ID](./time-series-insights-update-how-to-id.md). |
   | **Storage Account Name** | Enter a global unique name for a new storage account to be created. |

   After filling in the fields above, click **Next: Event Source**.

   ![Click Next: Event Source][10]

1. On the page, fill the fields as follows:

   | | |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Create an Event Source?** | Enter `Yes`|
   | **Name** | Requires a unique value, which is used to name the event source.|
   | **Source Type** | Enter `IoT Hub` |
   | **Select a Hub?** | Enter `Select Existing` |
   | **Subscription** | Enter the subscription that you used for device simulator. |
   | **IoT Hub name** | Enter the IoT hub name that you created for device simulator. |
   | **IoT Hub access policy** | Enter `iothubowner` |
   | **Iot Hub consumer group** | You need a unique consumer group for an Azure Time Series Insights Preview. |
   | **Timestamp** | This field is used to identify the timestamp property in your incoming telemetry data. For this tutorial, do not fill the field. This simulator uses the incoming timestamp from IoT Hub which Time Series Insights defaults to.|
