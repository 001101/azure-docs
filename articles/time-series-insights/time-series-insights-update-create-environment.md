# Provisioning and managing Azure Time Series Insights update

This document describes how to provision and manage a new Azure Time Series Insights V2 Update environment in the Azure portal.

## Overview

A brief description about provisioning following The Azure Time Series V2 Update:

* Provision an Azure Time Series Insights update environment.
* As part of the creation process you will need to provide a **Time Series ID**. It can be up to **three** (3) keys. Learn more about [Time Series ID](./time-series-update-tsm.md).
* When you provision a Time Series Insights update environment you create two Azure resources, a Time Series Insights update environment and an Azure Storage general-purpose V1 account.  
* In the future, new Azure customers will by default only be allowed to provision an Azure Storage general-purpose V2 account, therefore we will support it when that change occurs.  
* Do not enable cold/archival properties on the storage account you will be using.
* You can then optionally connect the update environment to a Time Series Insight supported event source (for example, IoT Hub).
* Here you want to provide the **Timestamp ID** property and provide a unique consumer group to ensure that the environment has access to all your events.
* After provisioning, you can then optionally manage access policies and other environment attributes that support your business requirements.

## New environment creation

1. Select `PAYG` from the **SKU** dropdown.  You’ll also input an environment name, designate which subscription and resource group you wish to create the environment in, and select a supported location for the environment to reside in.  

1. Create a new Azure Storage account by selecting a storage account name and designating a replication choice.  Doing so will automatically create a new Azure Storage general-purpose V1 account in the same region as the Azure Time Series Insights V2 Update environment you previously selected.  

1. Input **Time Series ID** property:

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **Time Series ID** is both case sensitive and immutable.

    Learn more details on selecting the appropriate **Time Series ID**. **Time Series IDs** can be up to three keys.

    ![environment_details][1]

1. Optionally, you can add an event source:

    * Azure Time Series Insights supports Azure IoT Hub and Event Hubs as options.  While you can only add a single event source at environment creation time, you can add an additional event source later.  It’s best to create a unique consumer group to ensure all events are visible to Time Series Insights.  You can select an existing consumer group or create a new consumer group when adding the event source.

    * Also designate the appropriate **Timestamp** property.  By default, Time Series Insights uses the message enqueued time for each event source, which may not be right if you are batching events or uploading historical data.  Therefore, it is imperative to input the case-sensitive timestamp property when adding the event source.

1. Review and create:

    Confirm that everything's correct!

## Management

You have the ability to manage your Time Series Insights updated environment using the Azure portal. If you’re familiar with the generally available Time Series Insights experience, not much is changing.

Here are the major differences in managing an L1 Time Series Insights environment versus an S1 or S2 environment using the Azure portal:

* Time Series Insights Azure portal Overview blade:
* Using the overview blade remains the same except for:
* Capacity is removed as this concept is not relevant to L1 environments.
* The Time Series ID property has been added. This is an immutable property you added at provisioning time and defines how your data is partitioned.
* Reference data sets are removed.
* Time Series Insights Azure Portal Configure blade:
* Retention is removed as retention will be set to unlimited.
* We expect to add more controls to this in the future, but for now you cannot set a limit on this.
* Capacity, calculator, and storage limit exceeded behavior all removed.
* Time Series Insights Azure Portal Reference data blade:
* This entire blade has been removed as reference data is not a component of L1 environments.
