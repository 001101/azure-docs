# Time Series Insights JavaScript Client Overview

## tooltip

The TSI API exposes a method for aggregating data pushed into Time Series Insights.  An example aggregates call that simply logs the result to the console is

```js
var tsiClient = new TsiClient();      
tsiClient.server.getAggregates(authToken, environmentFqdn, aggregateExpressionArray,options).then(function(result){console.log(result)});
```

Where the parameters for getAggregates are as follows:

* authToken is a user token for Time Series Insights obtained from, for example, adal.js
* environmentFqdn is the FQDN for the environment that is being queried, which can be obtained in the azure portal for the environment
* aggregateExpressionArray is an array of aggregateExpressions, which will be described below
* options is a set of options for the aggregates call, which will be described below
