If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.3 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

This tutorial will also make heavy use of the "Developer Tools" feature (also known as F12 or DevTools), found in most web browsers such as [Edge](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide), [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/), [FireFox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools), and other modern browsers. If you're not already familiar, you may want to explore this feature in your browser before continuing. 

## TSI sample application overview

Talk about the structure of the HTML downloaded from the SPA web app. Talk about the fact that it uses a couple of additional CSS files for styling, uses DIVs for formatting/placement, and uses TSClient.js library to make API calls and render UX/controls.
