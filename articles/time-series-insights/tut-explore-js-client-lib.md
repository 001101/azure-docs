# Tutorial: Explore the Time Series Insights JavaScript client library

This tutorial guides you through an exploration of the Time Series Insights (TSI) JavaScript client library, and the related programming model. The topics discussed provide you with opportunities to experiment, gain a deeper understanding of how to access TSI data, and use chart controls to render and visualize data. The goal is to provide you with enough details, that you can use the library in your own web application.

In this tutorial, you learn about:

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-powershell.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.3 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Prerequisites

<!--
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
-->
This tutorial makes heavy use of the "Developer Tools" feature (also known as DevTools or F12), found in most browsers such as [Edge](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide), [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/), [FireFox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools), and other modern web browsers. If you're not already familiar, you may want to explore this feature in your browser before continuing. 

## TSI sample application

Throughout this tutorial, you use a Time Series Insights sample application to explore the TSI JavaScript library. The sample application is a Single-Page web Application (SPA), which showcases the use of the library for querying and visualizing data from a sample TSI environment. 

1. Navigate to the [Time Series Insights sample application](https://tsiclientsample.azurewebsites.net/)
   ![TSI Client Sample sign-in prompt](media/tut-explore-js-client-lib/tcs-sign-in.png)

2. Click the "Log in" button. You can use either an enterprise/organization account (Azure Active Directory) or a personal account (Microsoft Account, or MSA). The first time you use the application with a given account, you are prompted to give your consent to the application. Consent allows the application to sign in under your account, and access the TSI APIs to retrieve data on your behalf.

3. After successful sign-in, you should see a page similar to the following, containing several styles of charts, populated with TSI data:

### Page source and structure

Now let's view the source code behind the page that rendered in your browser as the TSI sample application. You won't walk through everything, but you'll learn about the major sections of the code, giving you sense of what the page is doing:

1. Open "Developer Tools" in your browser, and inspect the elements that make up the current page, also known as the HTML or DOM tree:

   ![TSI Client Sample with DevTools](media/tut-explore-js-client-lib/tcs-devtools-callouts.png)

2. You can see in the previous image that the page contains, among many other things, the following major sections:
   - The \<head\> element, which pulls in additional files to assist in the functioning of the page:
     - a \<script\> element for the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (`adal.min.js`) - also known as ADAL, this is a JavaScript library that provides OAuth 2.0 authentication (sign-in) and token acquisition for accessing APIs.
     - \<link\> elements for style sheets (`sampleStyles.css`, `tsiclient.css`) - used to control page styling details, such as colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
     - a \<script\> element for the TSI Client library (`tsiclient.js`) - a JavaScript library used by the page to call TSI APIs and render chart controls on the page.
   - The \<body\> element, which defines the layout of the page:
     - The \<div\> section that contains the Log In dialog (`id="loginModal"`).
     - The \<div\> section that controls the placement of the header row, used for status messages and sign-in information (`class="header"`).
     - The \<div\> section that controls the placement of all of the chart controls (`class="chartsWrapper"`).
     - The \<script\> section which contains all of the JavaScript used to control the page .

### TSI Client JavaScript library

Although we won't review it in detail, fundamentally the library provides an abstraction for two important categories :
- wrappers for calling the TSI environment REST APIs to query data
- several types of charting controls used for rendering data in a web page

As you explore more of the source code below, and walk through specific examples, you will see the programming model and API patterns take shape through the use of the library.

## Explore pie, line, and bar charts

First, lets look at some of the standard chart controls as demonstrated in the TSI Client Sample application.
