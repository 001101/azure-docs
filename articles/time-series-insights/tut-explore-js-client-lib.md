# Tutorial: Explore the Time Series Insights JavaScript client library

This tutorial guides you through an exploration of the Time Series Insights (TSI) JavaScript client library, and the related programming model. The topics discussed will provide you with opportunities to experiment, and gain a deeper understanding of how the library makes it easy to access data from a TSI environment, and use chart controls to render and visualize the data. The goal is to provide you with enough details, that you can use the library in your own web application.

In this tutorial, you learn about:

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.3 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

This tutorial makes heavy use of the "Developer Tools" feature (also known as F12 or DevTools), found in most browsers such as [Edge](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide), [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/), [FireFox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools), and other modern web browsers. If you're not already familiar, you may want to explore this feature in your browser before continuing. 

## TSI sample application overview

Throughout this tutorial, we will be using the Time Series Insights sample application to explore the TSI JavaScript library. The sample application is a Single-Page web Application (SPA), which showcases the use of the library for querying and visualizing data from a sample TSI environment. Fundamentally, the library provides an abstraction for two important categories :
- the TSI environment REST APIs used for querying data
- the charting controls used for rendering data in a web page

TODO: Stuff to integrate below:
- Talk about the structure of the HTML downloaded from the SPA web app. 
- Talk about the fact that it uses a couple of additional CSS files for styling, uses DIVs for formatting/placement, and uses TSClient.js library to make API calls and render UX/controls.

1. Navigate to the [Time Series Insights sample application](https://tsiclientsample.azurewebsites.net/)

2. Click the "Log in" button. You can use either an enterprise/organization account (Azure Active Directory) or a personal account (Microsoft Account, or MSA). If this is the first time you've used the application with a given account, you'll also be prompted to give your consent to the application. Consent allows the application to sign in under your account, and access the TSI APIs to retreive data.

3. After successful sign-in, you should see the a page similar to the following, containing several styles of charts, populated with TSI data:
