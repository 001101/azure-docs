# Monitoring Time Series Insights

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data generated by Time Series Insights and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze and alert on this data.

## Monitor overview

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for Time Series Insights includes charts that provide some usage metrics, such as the number of messages used and the number of devices connected to Time Series Insights.

## What is Azure Monitor

Time Series Insights creates monitoring data using [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview), which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure that provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources in addition to resources in other clouds and on-premises.

Start with the article [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource), which describes the following concepts:

- What is Azure Monitor?
- Costs associated with monitoring
- Monitoring data collected in Azure
- Configuring data collection
- Standard tools in Azure for analyzing and alerting on monitoring data

The following sections build on this article by describing the specific data gathered for Time Series Insights and providing examples for configuring data collection and analyzing this data with Azure tools.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for Time Series Insights with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening Metrics from the Azure Monitor menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started) for details on using this tool.

### Ingress metrics

   |Metric  |Unit |Aggregation Type |Description |
   |---------|---------|---------|---------|
   |**Ingress Received Bytes** |  |  |Count of raw bytes read from event sources. Raw count usually includes the property name and value.|
   |**Ingress Received Invalid Messages** |  |  |Count of messages read from all Event Hubs or IoT Hubs event sources. |
   |**Ingress Received Messages** |  |  |Count of invalid messages read from all Azure Event Hubs or Azure IoT Hub event sources. |
   |**Ingress Stored Bytes** |  |  |Total size of events stored and available for query. Size is computed only on the property value. |
   |**Ingress Stored Events** |  |  |Count of flattened events stored and available for query. |
   |**Ingress Received Message Time Lag** |  |  |Difference in seconds between the time that the message is enqueued in the event source and the time it is processed in Ingress. |
   |**Ingress Received Message Count Lag** |  |  |Difference between the sequence number of last enqueued message in the event source partition and sequence number of message being processed in Ingress. |

### Storage metrics

   |Metric Display Name |Unit |Aggregation Type |Description |
   |---------|---------|---------|---------|
   |**Failed twin reads from back end** |Count |Total |The count of all failed back-end-initiated twin reads. |
   |**Failed twin updates from back end** |Count |Total |The count of all failed back-end-initiated twin updates. |
   |**Response size of twin reads from back end** |Bytes |Average |The count of all successful back-end-initiated twin reads. |
   |**Size of twin updates from back end** |Bytes |Average |The total size of all successful back-end-initiated twin updates. |
   |**Successful twin reads from back end** |Count |Total| The count of all successful back-end-initiated twin reads. |
   |**Successful twin updates from back end** |Count |Total |The count of all successful back-end-initiated twin updates. |

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties. The data in these tables are associated with a Log Analytics workspace and can be queried in Log Analytics. To learn more about Azure Monitor Logs, see [Azure Monitor Logs overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-logs) in the Azure Monitor documentation.

To route data to Azure Monitor Logs, you must create a diagnostic setting to send resource logs or platform metrics to a Log Analytics workspace. To learn more, see [Collection and routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/monitor-iot-hub#collection-and-routing).

## Sample Queries

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

When creating an alert rule based on platform metrics, be aware that for Time Series Insights platform metrics that are collected in units of count, some aggregations may not be available or usable. To learn more, see Supported aggregations in the Monitoring Azure IoT Hub data reference.
