# Connect Time Series Insights to Power BI  
 
If you are looking for a solution to help correlate your time-series data, create vivid visualizations, and share insights across your organization: Azure Time Series Insights now seamlessly integrates with [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/) to empower you over your streaming data.

## Overview

Azure Time Series Insights is a platform for storing, managing, querying, and visualizing time-series data on the cloud. 

Power BI is a business analytics tool with rich visualization capabilities that allows you to share insights and results across your organization.

By connecting your data to Power BI, you can now:

* Perform correlations with other data sources supported by Power BI and access a host of different data visualization options. 
* Create Power BI dashboards and reports using your Time Series Insight data, and share them with your organization. 
* Unlock data interop scenarios in a simple, easy-to-use manner, and get to insights faster than ever.

## Native Connector

Connecting your data takes less than a minute. By loading previously **Saved Queries** into Power BI, or by quickly exporting your view from Time Series Insight Explorer to Power BI, anyone in your organization can intuitively access and visually transform data.

Configuration options include choosing between **Raw** and **Aggregate-level** data and selecting a desired time range. Once data has been connected, all of Power BI's rich visualization and charting tools are available to further enhance your information sharing capabilities. 

Read [the tutorial](./tutorial-power-bi.md) to get started.

## Flexible Workflow
 
Use the connector from anywhere in your workflow:

* If you are in Time Series Insights Explorer, you can quickly export your view to Power BI. 
* If you are already in Power BI, load data from previously Saved Queries. 

For advanced querying and editing functionality within Power BI, use Power BIâ€™s Advanced Editor.

## Next Steps

* Read the [Tutorial](./tutorial-power-bi.md) and connect your Time Series Insights instance to Power BI.
