# Tutorial: Create an Azure Time Series Insights environment

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a Time Series Insight (TSI) environment, populated with data from simulated devices. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a TSI environment 
> * Create a device simulation solution containing an IoT Hub
> * Connect the TSI environment to the IoT hub
> * Stream simulated data into the IoT hub and TSI environment

## Prerequisites

If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) before you begin. 

Your Azure sign-in account also needs to be a member of the subscription's "Owner" role. For details, see [Add or change Azure subscription administrators](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator)

## Overview

The TSI environment is where device data is collected and stored. Once stored in the TSI environment, you can use the [TSI Explorer](time-series-quickstart.md) and [TSI Query API](/rest/api/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-reference-queryapi) to query and analyze the data.

Like all devices, simulated or physical, IoT Hub is the connection point used by devices to securely connect and transmit data to the cloud. As discussed in the [TSI Overview](time-series-insights-overview.md), IoT Hub also serves as an event source, for streaming data into the TSI environment. 

This tutorial also uses an [IoT solution accelerator](/azure/iot-accelerators/), to generate and stream sample data to IoT Hub. IoT solution accelerators provide enterprise-grade preconfigured solutions, that enable you to accelerate the development of custom IoT solutions. 

## Create a TSI environment

First, create a TSI environment in your Azure subscription:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure subscription account.  
2. Select **+ Create a resource** in the upper left.  
3. Select the **Internet of Things** category, then select **Time Series Insights**.  
   
   [![Select the Time Series Insights environment resource](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-create-resource-tsi.png)](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-create-resource-tsi.png#lightbox)

4. On the **Time Series Insights environment** page, fill in the required parameters:
   
   Parameter|Description
   ---|---
   **Environment name** | Choose a unique name for the TSI environment. The name is used by TSI Explorer and the Query API.
   **Subscription** | Subscriptions contain Azure resources. Choose the subscription that will contain the TSI environment.
   **Resource group** | A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources. Choose an existing resource group, or create a new one, to contain the TSI environment resource.
   **Location** | Choose a data center region to contain your TSI environment. To avoid added bandwidth costs and  latency, it's best to keep the TSI environment in the same region as other IoT resources.
   **Pricing SKU** | Choose the throughput needed. For lowest cost and starter capacity, select S1.
   **Capacity** | Capacity is the multiplier applied to the ingress rate, storage capacity, and cost associated with the selected SKU.  You can change capacity of an environment after creation. For lowest cost, select a capacity of 1. 

   When finished, click **Create** to begin the provisioning process.

5. You can check the **Notifications** panel to monitor deployment completion, which should take about a minute:  

   ![Time Series Insights environment deployment succeeded](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-create-resource-tsi-deployment-succeeded.png)

## Create a device simulation

Next, create the device simulation solution, which will generate test data to populate your TSI environment:

1. In a separate window/tab, go to https://www.azureiotsolutions.com, sign in using your Azure subscription account, and select the "Device Simulation" accelerator:

   ![Run the Device Simulation accelerator](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/sa-main.png)

2. Enter the required parameters on the **Create Device Simulation solution** page:

   Parameter|Description
   ---|---
   **Solution name** | Requires a unique value, which is used for creation of a new resource group in your subscription. The new resource group will contain all of the Azure resources listed, which are required for the solution.
   **Subscription** | Specify the same subscription used for creation of your TSI environment, in the previous section.
   **Region** | Specify the same region used for creation of your TSI environment, in the previous section. 
   **Deploy optional Azure Resources** | Leave **IoT Hub** checked, as the simulated devices will use it to connect/stream data.

   When finished, click **Create Solution** to provision the solution, which will take a few minutes to complete. The new Azure resources will be created, in the resource group and subscription you specified.

   ![Provision the device simulation solution](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/sa-create-device-sim-solution.png)

3. Once provisioning has finished, the text above your new solution will change from "Provisioning..." to "Ready":

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > Don't click the **Launch** button yet! But keep this web page open as you will return to it later.

   ![Device simulation solution provisioning complete](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/sa-create-device-sim-solution-dashboard-ready.png)

4. Now go back to the Azure portal and inspect the newly created resources. You'll notice a new resource group has been created using the **Solution name** you provided in the last step. The resource group contains the resources created for the device simulation solution:

   [![Device simulation solution resources](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-device-sim-solution-resources.png)](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-device-sim-solution-resources.png#lightbox)

## Connect the TSI environment to the IoT hub 

At this point, you've learned how to:
- create an empty TSI environment
- use the IoT device simulation solution accelerator to create supporting Azure resources, including an IoT hub

Recall that the simulated devices need to connect to IoT hub, in order to stream device data. To get the data to flow into the TSI environment, you need to make configuration changes to both the TSI environment and the IoT hub. 

### IoT hub configuration: define a consumer group

IoT hub provides various endpoints to expose functionality to other actors. The "Events" endpoint provides a way for other applications to consume data as it is streamed to an IoT hub instance. Specifically, the "Events" endpoint provides the ability to define a named "consumer group", on which applications can listen and pull data from the IoT Hub. 

Next you define a new "consumer group", on the device simulation solution's IoT hub "Events" endpoint. 

1. Using the Azure portal, go to the **Overview** page of the resource group you created for the device simulation solution, then select the IoT Hub resource:

   [![Device simulation solution resource group](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-add-iot-hub-consumer-group-view-rg.png)](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-add-iot-hub-consumer-group-view-rg.png#lightbox)

   Also make note of the **Name** of the IoT Hub resource generated for the solution, as you will use it in future steps.

2. Scroll down and select the **Endpoints** page, then select the **Events** endpoint. On the **Properties** page, enter a unique name for your endpoint under the "$Default" consumer group, then click **Save**:

### TSI environment configuration: define an event source

Now we will connect the new IoT hub "consumer group" event endpoint, to the TSI environment, as an "event source".

1. Go to the **Overview** page of the resource group you created for the TSI environment, then select the TSI environment:

   [![TSI environment resource group and environment](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-add-env-event-source-view-rg.png)](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-add-env-event-source-view-rg.png#lightbox)

2. On the TSI environment page, select **Event Sources**, then click **+ Add**:

   ![TSI environment overview](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/ap-add-env-event-source-add.png)

3. Enter the required parameters on the **New event source** page: 

   Parameter|Description
   ---|---
   **Event source name** | Requires a unique value, which is used to name the event source.
   **Source** | Select "IoT Hub."
   **Import option** | Use the defaulted "Use IoT hub from available subscriptions." This option will cause the next drop-down list to be populated with the available subscriptions.
   **Subscription** | Select the same subscription in which you created the TSI environment and Device Simulation resources.
   **Iot hub name** | Should be defaulted to the name of the IoT hub that you noted in step #1. If not, select the correct IoT hub.
   **Iot hub policy name** | Leave as the defaulted value of "iothubowner."
   **Iot hub consumer group** | Should be defaulted to the name of the IoT hub consumer group you created in step #2. If not, select the correct consumer group name. 
   **Event serialization format** | Leave as the defaulted value of "JSON."
   **Timestamp property name** | Specify as "timestamp."

   When finished, click **Create **.

## Stream the sample data to IoT hub and into the TSI environment

Now that all of the configuration work is complete, it's time to populate the TSI environment with sample data from the simulated devices.

You may recall from the [Create a device simulation section](#create-a-device-simulation), several Azure resources were created by the accelerator, to support the device simulation solution. In addition to the IoT hub discussed previously, an Azure App Service web application was generated to support device simulation. 

1. Go back to your [Solution accelerators dashboard](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators#dashboard). Sign in again if necessary, using the same Azure account you've been using in this tutorial. Now you can click the **Launch** button under your "Device Simulation" solution:

     ![Solution accelerators dashboard](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/sa-create-device-sim-solution-dashboard.png)

2. The device simulation web app will start at this point, and may take several seconds upon initial load. You will also be prompted to give the web application consent to receive the "Sign you in and read your profile" permission. This allows the application to retreive the user profile information necessary to support the functioning of the application:

     ![Device simulation web application consent](media/tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment/sawa-signin-consent.png)

3. Once the **Simulation setup** page loads, enter the required parameters: 

   Parameter|Description
   ---|---
   **Target IoT Hub** | Select "Use pre-provisioned IoT Hub."
   **Device model** | Select "Chiller."
   **Number of devices** | Enter 1000.
   **Telemetry frequency** | Enter 10 seconds.
   **Simulation duration** | Enter 5 minutes.

   These parameters will cause the simulation to run for a total of 5 minutes, generating data from 1000 simulated devices, every 10 seconds (30 times). When finished, click **Start Simulation**.

4. TBD

## Clean up resources

At this point, you might have the IoT Hub and TSI Environment services running in the portal. If you wish to abandon and/or delay completion of this tutorial series, we recommend delete all resources to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. 

From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal:

- click the **Resource groups** icon, then select the resource group you created for the TSI Environment. At the top of the page, click **Delete resource group**, enter the name of the resource group, then click **Delete**. 
- click the **Resource groups** icon, then select the resource group that was created by the device simulation solution accelerator. At the top of the page, click **Delete resource group**, enter the name of the resource group, then click **Delete**.
