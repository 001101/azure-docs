# Tutorial: Create an Azure Time Series Insights single-page web app

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a single-page web app (SPA), modeled after the [Time Series Insights (TSI) sample application](https://insights.timeseries.azure.com/clientsample). In this tutorial, you'll about:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * The application design
> * How to register the application with Azure Active Directory (AD)
> * How to build, publish, and test the web application 

## Prerequisites

If you haven't established your own TSI environment yet, complete the [Create an Azure Time Series Insights environment](tutorial-create-populate-tsi-environment.md) tutorial first, before starting this one. You also learn how to create a [free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), if you don't already have one. You'll use the TSI environment as a data source for this tutorial. 

You'll also need to install Visual Studio if you haven't already. For this tutorial, you can [download/install the free Community version, or a free trial](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

## Application design overview

As mentioned, the TSI sample application provides the basis for the design and code of this tutorial. The TSI sample application uses the TSI Client JavaScript library to query and visualize data from a TSI environment. 

The TSI Client JavaScript library provides an abstraction for two important API categories:
- **Wrapper methods for calling the TSI Query APIs**: REST APIs that allow you to query for TSI data by using JSON-based expressions. The methods are organized under the `TsiClient.server` namespace of the library.
- **Methods for creating and populating several types of charting controls**: Methods that are used for visualizing the TSI data in a web page. The methods are organized under the `TsiClient.ux` namespace of the library.

For an overview of the structure of the TSI sample app its use of the TSI Client library, refer to the [Explore the Azure Time Series Insights JavaScript client library](tutorial-explore-js-client-lib.md) tutorial.

## Register the application with Azure AD 

Before building the application, you register it with Azure AD. Registration serves as the identity configuration for an application, enabling it to use Azure AD's OAuth support for single sign-on. OAuth requires SPA applications to use the "implicit" authorization grant, so you also use the manifest editor to update the corresponding property. An application manifest is a JSON representation of the application's identity configuration. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure subscription account.  
2. Select the **Azure Active Directory** resource in the left pane, then **App registrations**, then **+ New application registration**:

3. On the **Create** page, fill in the required parameters:
   
   Parameter|Description
   ---|---
   **Name** | Provide a meaningful registration name.  
   **Application type** | Since you're building an SPA web application, leave as "Web app/API."
   **Sign-on URL** | Enter the URL for the home/sign-in page of the application. Because you host the application in Azure App Service (later), you must use a URL within the "https://azurewebsites.net" domain. In this example, the name is based on the registration name.

   When finished, click **Create** to create the new application registration.

4. Resource applications provide REST APIs for use by other applications, and are also registered with Azure AD. APIs provide granular/secured access to client applications, by exposing "scopes." Because your application will call the "Azure Time Series Insights" API, you need to specify the API and scope, for which permission will be requested at runtime. Select **Settings**, then **Required permissions**, then **+ Add**:

   ![Azure AD create application registration](media/tutorial-create-tsi-sample-spa/ap-aad-app-registration-add-perms.png)

5. On the **Add API access** page you specify the API. Click **1 Select an API**, on the **Select an API** page, enter "azure time" in the search field. Then select the "Azure Time Series Insights" API in the results list, and click **Select**: 

   ![Azure AD create application registration](media/tutorial-create-tsi-sample-spa/ap-aad-app-registration-add-perms-api.png)

6. Now you specify a scope on the API. On the **Add API access** page again, click **2 Select permissions**. On the **Enable Access** page, select the "Access Azure Time Series Insights service" scope. Then click **Select**, then click **Done** back on the **Add API access** page:

7. As mentioned previously, you also need to update the application manifest. Click on the application name in the breadcrumb to go back to the **Registered app** page. Select **Manifest**, change the `oauth2AllowImplicitFlow` property to `true`, then click **Save**:

   ![Azure AD create application registration](media/tutorial-create-tsi-sample-spa/ap-aad-app-registration-update-manifest.png)

8. Finally, click on the breadcrumb to go back to the **Registered app** page again, and copy the **Home page** and **Application ID** properties for your application. You'll use these in a later step:

   ![Azure AD create application registration](media/tutorial-create-tsi-sample-spa/ap-aad-app-registration-application.png)

## Build and publish the web application

First, download the TSI sample application source code files into a working directory:

1. Create a working directory to store your application project
2. Browse to each of the following URLs, then right-click on the "Raw" link in the upper right area of the page, and use your browser's "Save as" feature to download into your working directory:

   - **index.html** HTML and JavaScript for the page https://github.com/Microsoft/tsiclient/blob/tutorial/pages/samples/index.html
   - **sampleStyles.css:** CSS style sheet: https://github.com/Microsoft/tsiclient/blob/tutorial/pages/samples/sampleStyles.css
    
Next, use Visual Studio to create and build the application:

1. Start Visual Studio
2. On the **File** menu, select the **Open**, **Web site** option.
3. Select the working directory where you stored the HTML and CSS files. Select the HTML file:
4. Open Solution Explorer, you should see index.html and styles.css files. 
5. Right click on the solution to publish the web app to Azure. Right Click -> Publish Web App
6. Click Microsoft Azure App Service 
7. Click “New” Resource Group and provide a resource group name and click “OK” 
8. Click “New” App Service Plan and provide an App service plan name and click “OK” 
9. Click “Create” to complete the hosting steps
10. Click “Publish” to publish the web app



## Test the web application

## Clean up resources

This tutorial creates several running Azure services, to support the SPA web application. If you plan to abandon or delay completion of this tutorial series, we recommend deleting all resources to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. 

From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal:

1. Click the **Resource groups** icon, then select the resource group you created for the TSI Environment. At the top of the page, click **Delete resource group**, enter the name of the resource group, then click **Delete**. 
2. Click the **Resource groups** icon, then select the resource group that was created by the device simulation solution accelerator. At the top of the page, click **Delete resource group**, enter the name of the resource group, then click **Delete**.
