# Visualize data from Time Series Insights in Power BI

Azure Time Series Insights is a platform for storing, managing, querying, and visualizing time-series data in the cloud. [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a business analytics tool with rich visualization capabilities that allows you to share insights and results across your organization. Both services can now be integrated to get the best of both Time Series Insights' inherent visualization capabilities as well as Power BI's.

You'll learn how to:

* Connect Time Series Insights to Power BI using the cloud connector
* Create visuals with your data in Power BI
* Publish the report to Power BI and share with the rest of your organization

By the end, you'll be able to visualize time-series data through Azure Time Series Insights and enhance it with the strong data correlation, visual editing, and easy sharing capabilities of Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> The Power BI Connector is available in both Azure Time Series Insights General Availability and Preview.

Make sure to sign up for a [free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't already have one.

### Export data into Power BI desktop

This option is recommended if you want to explore your data using [Time Series Insights GA Explorer](time-series-quickstart.md) or [Time Series Insights Preview Explorer](time-series-insights-update-quickstart.md), then quickly export your view to Power BI afterwards. To get started:

1. Open the GA or Preview Time Series Insights Explorer and curate your data.
1. Once you have created a view you are satisfied with, navigate to the **More Actions** dropdown menu and click on **Connect to Power BI**. 

    [![Time Series Insights Explorer](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/1-power-bi-01.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/1-power-bi-01.png#lightbox)

1. Set your parameters inside this tab:

   1. Specify a relative timeframe to view. If you are happy with your existing view, leave this as **Existing timeframe**. 
   1. Choose between **Aggregated Events** and **Raw Events** level data. 
   
       > [!NOTE]
       > You can always aggregate your data later in Power BI, but you cannot revert to raw data after aggregation. There is a 100-K event count limit for Raw Event level data.

   1. **Optional**: If you do not want to export metadata information, uncheck the **Join instance fields** box 

       [![Connect](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/1-power-bi-02.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/1-power-bi-02.png#lightbox)

   1. If you have not configured your Time Series Insights instance for warm store, you will receive a warning.

### Load previously saved queries in Power BI desktop

This workflow is best if you want to access your data only from the Power BI Desktop tool without going into Time Series Insights Explorer.

1. There are three ways to refresh a query once it has already been imported into Power BI desktop from Time Series Insights.

    [![Import saved queries](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-01.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-01.png#lightbox)

    A. Imported queries are listed under the **Fields** pane. 

    B. Imported queries are displayed in the **Model** view.

        [![Imported queries displayed in the Model view](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-01-c.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-01-c.png#lightbox)

    C. Recently imported queries can be accessed through the **Recent Sources** drop-down.

1. After you have selected your query. Select or right-click to **Refresh data**.

## Create a report with visuals

Now that you have imported the data into Power BI, itâ€™s time to build a report with visuals.

### Power BI desktop

1. On the left side of the window, make sure you have selected the **Report** view.

    [![Select the Report View](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-02.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-02.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Visualizations** pane, select your visual of choice. Verify your axis and value parameters.

    [![Select the Report View](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-03.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-03.png#lightbox)

Once you have created your report, you can publish it to Power BI Reporting Services.

### Power BI cloud

You can now create charts and graphs after importing your CSV data into Power BI cloud.

1. Your file data will then appear under **Datasets**. Select the dataset to load your data into a chart.

1.  Select the chart type, **Fields**, and sort by timestamp.

    [![Export a specific time interval and its data](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-04.png)](media/how-to-connect-power-bi/3-power-bi-04.png#lightbox)

## Advanced editing

If you have already loaded a dataset in Power BI but would like to modify the query (such as the date/time or Environment ID parameters), you can do this via Power BIâ€™s Advanced Editor functionality. Refer to the [Power BI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/desktop-query-overview) to learn more.

As an overview:

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **Edit Queries**.
1. Press **Advanced Editor**.
1. Modify the JSON payload as desired.
