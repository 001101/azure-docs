# Troubleshoot changes in your environment

In this tutorial, you learn how to troubleshoot changes on an Azure virtual machine. By enabling Change tracking, you can track changes to software, files, Linux daemons, Windows Services, and Windows Registry keys on your computers.
Identifying these configuration changes can help you pinpoint operational issues across your environment.

In this tutorial you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Onboard a VM for Change tracking and Inventory
> * View changes
> * Search inventory logs for installed software
> * Enable Activity log tracking
> * Stop and Start your VM
> * Review change results

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial:

* Azure subscription. If you don't have one yet, you can [activate your MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* [Automation account](automation-offering-get-started.md) to hold the watcher and action runbooks and the Watcher Task.
* A [virtual machine](../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md) to onboard.

## Log in to Azure

Log in to the Azure portal at http://portal.azure.com.

## Enable Change tracking and Inventory

First you need to enable Change tracking and Inventory for your VM for this tutorial. If you have previously enabled another automation solution for a VM, this step is not necessary.

1. On the left menu, select **Virtual machines** and select a VM from the list
1. On the left menu, under the **Operations** section, click **Inventory**. The **Enable Change tracking and Inventory** page opens.

Validation is performed to determine if Change tracking and Inventory is enabled for this VM.
The validation includes checks for a Log Analytics workspace and linked Automation account, and if the solution is in the workspace.

A [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fautomation%2ftoc.json) workspace is used to collect data that is generated by features and services such as Inventory.
The workspace provides a single location to review and analyze data from multiple sources.

The validation process also checks to see if the VM is provisioned with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and hybrid worker.
This agent is used to communicate with the VM and obtain information about installed software.
The validation process also checks to see if the VM is provisioned with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and Automation hybrid runbook worker.

If these prerequisites aren't met, a banner appears that gives you the option to enable the solution.

![Change tracking and Inventory onboard configuration banner](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/enableinventory.png)

To enable the solution, click the banner.
If any of the following prerequisites were found to be missing after the validation, they're automatically added:

* [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-overview.md) workspace
* [Automation](./automation-offering-get-started.md)
* A [Hybrid runbook worker](./automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md) is enabled on the VM

The **Change Tracking and Inventory** screen opens. Configure the location, Log analytics workspace, and Automation account to use and click **Enable**. If the fields are grayed out, that means another automation solution is enabled for the VM and the same workspace and Automation account must be used.

![Enable change tracking solution window](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/installed-software-enable.png)

Enabling the solution can take up to 15 minutes. During this time, you shouldn't close the browser window.
After the solution is enabled, information about installed software and changes on the VM flows to Log Analytics.
It can take between 30 minutes and 6 hours for the data to be available for analysis.

## View changes

1. In the left pane of the Azure portal, select **Automation accounts**. 
If it is not visible in the left pane, click **All services** and search for it in the resulting view.
2. In the list, select an Automation account. 
3. In the left pane of the Automation account, select **Change tracking**.

## Using the Change tracking views
The Change tracking experience is made up three main components: the swimlane visualization, the change list, and the change filters.
The three components work together to create a robust and interactive exploration experience.

![Creating an alert on OMS classic portal](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/change-view.png)

### Swimlane visualization
On the **Change tracking** page, there is a large visualization consisting of multiple bar graphs and a line graph at the top. 
The swimlane visualization shows changes that have occurred over time. 
After you have added an Activity Log connection, the line graph at the top displays Azure Activity Log events. 
Each row of bar graphs represents a different trackable Change type. 
These types are Linux daemons, files, Windows Registry keys, software, and Windows services.

>[!NOTE] 
> To add an Activity Log connection, click the **Manage Activity Log Connection** button at the top of the page.
>
>


### Change list
Below the swimlane visualization, there are two tabs (**Changes** and **Events**) and a table. 
While on the **Changes** tab, the table displays the details for the changes shown in the visualization in descending order of time that the change occurred (most recent first).
While on the **Events** tab, the table displays the connected Activity Log events and their corresponding details with the most recent first. 

On both tabs, you can click on a row to drilldown and view additional details about the record.

### Change filters
There are two dropdowns on the top of the page that allow you to filter the data shown in the swimlane visualization and the change list. 
The **Change types** dropdown lets you filter which Change types are displayed in your results. 
The time range dropdown lets you filter the results to a specific time window.



## Using Change tracking in Log Analytics

Change tracking generates log data that is sent to Log Analytics. 
To search the logs by running queries, select **Log Analytics** at the top of the **Change tracking** window. 
Change tracking data is stored under the type **ConfigurationChange**. 
The following sample Log Analytics query returns all the Windows Services that have been stopped.

```
ConfigurationChange
| where ConfigChangeType == "WindowsServices" and SvcState == "Stopped"
```

To learn more about running and searching log files in Log Analytics, see [Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.loganalytics.io/index).

### Alerting on changes
Log Analytics provides the capability to alert based on a query. 

For the process of creating alert rules, see the following articles:

* Create alert rules using [OMS portal](../log-analytics/log-analytics-alerts-creating.md)
* Create alert rules using [Resource Manager template](../operations-management-suite/operations-management-suite-solutions-resources-searches-alerts.md)
* Create alert rules using [REST API](../log-analytics/log-analytics-api-alerts.md)


In the following example image, an alert is being created for services that are stopped and are of the startup type "Manual". 
On the alert page, you can configure what happens when an alert is triggered, such as an email notification, webhook, Azure Automation runbook, or an ITSM connection.

   ![Creating an alert on OMS classic portal](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/alert.png)

To learn more about creating alerts based on Log Analytics queries, see [Understanding Alerts in Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-alerts).


### Changes for a single machine
To see the changes for a single machine, you can access Change Tracking from the Azure VM resource page or use Log Analytics to filter down to the corresponding machine. 
The following sample Log Analytics query returns the list of software changes for a machine named `ContosoVM`.

```
ConfigurationChange
| where ConfigChangeType == "Software" 
| where Computer =="ContosoVM"
```

## Configure Change tracking
To choose which files and Registry keys to collect and track, select **Edit settings** at the top of the **Change tracking** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Inventory and Change tracking use the same collection settings, and settings are configured on a workspace level.
>
>

In the **Workspace Configuration** window, add the Windows Registry keys, Windows files, or Linux files to be tracked, as outlined in the next three sections.
