# Troubleshoot Start / Stop VMs

### <a name="cant-deploy-solution"></a>Scenario: I can't deploy the Start/Stop VMs during off-hours solution

#### Issue

#### Cause

#### Resolution

### <a name="all-vms-fail-to-startstop"></a>Scenario: All VMs fail to start/stop

#### Issue

You've configured the Start/Stop VM solution but it doesn't start/stop all the VMs configured.

#### Cause

This error can be caused by one of the following reasons:

1. A schedule isn't configured correctly
2. The RunAs account may not be configured correctly
3. The runbook may have run into errors

#### Resolution

Review the following list for potential solutions to your problem or places to look:

* Check that you've properly configured a schedule for the Start/Stop VM solution. To learn how to configure a schedule, see the [Schedules](../automation-schedules.md) article.

* Check the job streams for the runbooks to look for any errors. In the portal, go to your Automation Account and select **Jobs** under **Process Automation**. From the **Jobs** page look for jobs from one of the following runbooks:

  * AutoStop_CreateAlert_Child
  * AutoStop_CreateAlert_Parent
  * AutoStop_Disable
  * AutoStop_VM_Child
  * ScheduledStartStop_Base_Classic
  * ScheduledStartStop_Child_Classic
  * ScheduledStartStop_Child
  * ScheduledStartStop_Parent
  * SequencedStartStop_Parent

* Verify your [RunAs Account](../manage-runas-account.md) has proper permissions to the VMs you're trying to start or stop. To learn more about the permissions needed see, [Role Based Access Control with Azure Automation](../automation-role-based-access-control.md).

### <a name="custom-runbook"></a>Scenario: My custom runbook fails to start or stop my VMs

#### Issue

You've authored a custom runbook or downloaded one from the gallery and it isn't properly working.

#### Cause

The cause for the failure could be one of many things. Go to your Automation Account in the Azure portal and select **Jobs** under **Process Automation**. From the **Jobs** page, look for jobs from your runbook to view any job failures.

#### Resolution

It's recommended to use the [Start/Stop VMs during off hours solution](../automation-solution-vm-management.md) to start and stop VMs in Azure Automation. This solution is authored by Microsoft. Custom runbooks are not supported by Microsoft. You might find a solution for your custom runbook by visiting the [runbook troubleshooting](runbooks.md) article. This article provides general guidance and troubleshooting for runbooks of all types.

### <a name="dont-start-stop-in-sequence"></a>Scenario: VMs don't start/stop on correct sequence

#### Issue

The VMs that you have configured in the solution do not start or stop in the correct sequence.

#### Cause

This is caused by incorrect tagging on the VMs.

#### Resolution

Take the following steps to ensure that the solution is configured correctly.

1. Ensure all VMs to be to started or stopped have a `sequencestart` or `sequencestop` tag, depending on your situation with a positive integer value. VM's are processed in ascending order.
2. Make sure the resource groups for the VMs to be started or stopped are in the `External_Start_ResourceGroupNames` or `External_Stop_ResourceGroupNames` variables, depending on your situation.
3. Test your changes by executing the `SequencedStartStop_Parent` runbook with the WHATIF parameter set to True to preview your changes.

For more detailed and additional instructions on how to use the solution to start and stop VMs in sequence, see[Start/Stop VMs in sequence](../automation-solution-vm-management.md#scenario-2-startstop-vms-in-sequence-by-using-tags).

### <a name="other"></a>Scenario: My problem isn't listed above

#### Issue

You experience an issue or unexpected result when using the Start/Stop VMs during off-hours solution that isn't listed on this page.

#### Cause

Many times errors can be caused by using an old and outdated version of the solution.

#### Resolution

To resolve many errors, it's recommended to remove and update the solution. To learn how to do this, see [Update the Start/Stop VMs during off hours solution](../automation-solution-vm-management.md#update-the-solution).
