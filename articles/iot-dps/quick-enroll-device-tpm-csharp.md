These steps show how to programmatically create an individual enrollment for a TPM device in the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service using the [C# Service SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and a sample C# application. You can optionally enroll a simulated TPM device to the provisioning service using this individual enrollment entry. Although these steps work on both Windows and Linux machines, this article uses a Windows development machine.

## Prepare the development environment

1. Make sure you have [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) installed on your machine. 
2. Make sure to complete the steps in [Set up the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before you proceed.

If you want to enroll a simulated device at the end of this Quickstart, follow the steps in [Create and provision a simulated TPM device using C# device SDK](quick-create-simulated-device-tpm-csharp.md) up to the step where you get an endorsement key for the device. Note down the endorsement key, registration ID, and, optionally, the device ID, you need to use them later in this Quickstart. **Do not follow the steps to create an individual enrollment using the Azure portal.**

## Get the connection string for your provisioning service

1. For the sample in this Quickstart, you need the connection string for your provisioning service. 
    1. Log in to the Azure portal, click on the **All resources** button on the left-hand menu and open your Device Provisioning service. 
    2. Click **Shared access policies**, then click the access policy you want to use to open its properties. In the **Access Policy** window, copy and note down the primary key connection string. 

    ![Get provisioning service connection string from the portal][img-get-connection-string]

## Create the individual enrollment sample 

1. In Visual Studio, add a Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to a new solution by using the **Console App (.NET Framework)** project template. Make sure the .NET Framework version is 4.5.1 or later. Name the project **CreateTpmEnrollment**.

    ![New Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project][img-create-app]

2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **CreateTpmEnrollment** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**.
3. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, select **Browse**, search for **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service**, select **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service** package, and accept the terms of use. This procedure downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT Provisioning Service Client SDK][lnk-nuget-provisioning-service-sdk] NuGet package and its dependencies.

    ![NuGet Package Manager window][img-add-nuget]

4. Add the following `using` statement following the other `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service;
    ```
    
5. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the placeholder value with the connection string for the provisioning service that you want to create the enrollment for. You may optionally change the *Registration ID*, *Endorsement Key* (to another valid endorsement key), *Device ID*, and provisioning status. If you are using this Quickstart together with the [Create and provision a simulated TPM device using C# device SDK](quick-create-simulated-device-tpm-csharp.md) Quickstart to provision a simulated device, replace the *Endorsement Key* and *Registration ID* with the values that you noted down in that Quickstart. You can optionally replace the *Device ID* with the value suggested in that Quickstart, use your own value, or use the default value in the code. 
   
    ```csharp
    private static string ProvisioningConnectionString = "{Your provisioning service connection string}";
    private const string RegistrationId = "sample-registrationid-csharp";
    private const string TpmEndorsementKey =
        "AToAAQALAAMAsgAgg3GXZ0SEs/gakMyNRqXXJP1S124GUgtk8qHaGzMUaaoABgCAAEMAEAgAAAAAAAEAxsj2gUS" +
        "cTk1UjuioeTlfGYZrrimExB+bScH75adUMRIi2UOMxG1kw4y+9RW/IVoMl4e620VxZad0ARX2gUqVjYO7KPVt3d" +
        "yKhZS3dkcvfBisBhP1XH9B33VqHG9SHnbnQXdBUaCgKAfxome8UmBKfe+naTsE5fkvjb/do3/dD6l4sGBwFCnKR" +
        "dln4XpM03zLpoHFao8zOwt8l/uP3qUIxmCYv9A7m69Ms+5/pCkTu/rK4mRDsfhZ0QLfbzVI6zQFOKF/rwsfBtFe" +
        "WlWtcuJMKlXdD8TXWElTzgh7JS4qhFzreL0c1mI0GCj+Aws0usZh7dLIVPnlgZcBhgy1SSDQMQ==";
        
    // Optional parameters
    private const string OptionalDeviceId = "myCSharpDevice";
    private const ProvisioningStatus OptionalProvisioningStatus = ProvisioningStatus.Enabled;
    ```
    
6. Add the following method to the **Program** class.  This code creates individual enrollment entry and then calls the **CreateOrUpdateIndividualEnrollmentAsync** method on the provisioning service client to add the individual enrollment to the provisioning service.
   
    ```csharp
    public static async Task RunSample()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting sample...");

        using (ProvisioningServiceClient provisioningServiceClient =
                ProvisioningServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(ProvisioningConnectionString))
        {
            #region Create a new individualEnrollment config
            Console.WriteLine("\nCreating a new individualEnrollment...");
            Attestation attestation = new TpmAttestation(TpmEndorsementKey);
            IndividualEnrollment individualEnrollment =
                    new IndividualEnrollment(
                            RegistrationId,
                            attestation);

            // The following parameters are optional. Remove them if you don't need them.
            individualEnrollment.DeviceId = OptionalDeviceId;
            individualEnrollment.ProvisioningStatus = OptionalProvisioningStatus;
            #endregion

            #region Create the individualEnrollment
            Console.WriteLine("\nAdding new individualEnrollment...");
            IndividualEnrollment individualEnrollmentResult =
                await provisioningServiceClient.CreateOrUpdateIndividualEnrollmentAsync(individualEnrollment).ConfigureAwait(false);
            Console.WriteLine("\nIndividualEnrollment created with success.");
            Console.WriteLine(individualEnrollmentResult);
            #endregion
        
        }
    }
    ````
       
7. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
    ```csharp
    try
    {
        RunSample().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        //Console.WriteLine("\nException thrown:\n");
        Console.WriteLine("\nThe following exception was thrown:\n" + ex.ToString());
    }
    Console.WriteLine("\nHit <Enter> to exit ...");
    Console.ReadLine();
    ```
        
8. Build the solution.

## Run the individual enrollment sample
  
3. Run the sample in Visual Studio to create the individual enrollment for your TPM device.
 
3. On successful creation, the command window displays the properties of the new individual enrollment.

    ![Enrollment properties in the command output][img-output]

4. To verify that the individual enrollment has been created, in the Azure portal, on the Device Provisioning Service summary blade, select **Manage enrollments**. Select the **Individual Enrollments** tab and click the new enrollment entry that corresponds to the registration ID you used in the sample to verify the endorsement key and other properties for the entry.

    ![Enrollment properties in the portal][img-verify-enrollment]
 
If you've been following the steps in the [Create and provision a simulated TPM device using C# device SDK](quick-create-simulated-device-tpm-csharp.md) Quickstart, now that you've created the individual enrollment for your TPM device, you can continue with the remaining steps in that Quickstart to enroll your simulated device. (Be sure to skip the steps to create an individual enrollment using the Azure portal, though.)

## Clean up resources
If you plan to explore the C# service samples, do not clean up the resources created in this Quickstart. If you do not plan to continue, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this Quickstart.

1. Close the C# sample output window on your machine.
1. If you created a simulated TPM device, close the TPM simulator window.
2. Navigate to your Device Provisioning service in the Azure portal, click **Manage enrollments**, and then select the **Individual Enrollments** tab. Select the *Registration ID* for the enrollment entry you created using this Quickstart, and click the **Delete** button at the top of the blade. 
3. If you created a simulated TPM device, in the Azure portal, navigate to the IoT Hub where it was provisioned. In the left-hand menu under **Explorers**, click **IoT Devices**, select the check box next to your device, and then click **Delete** at the top of the window.
 
## Next steps
In this Quickstart, youâ€™ve programmatically created an individual enrollment entry for a TPM device, and, optionally, created a TPM simulated device on your machine and provisioned it to your IoT hub using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. To learn about device provisioning in depth, continue to the tutorial for the Device Provisioning Service setup in the Azure portal.
