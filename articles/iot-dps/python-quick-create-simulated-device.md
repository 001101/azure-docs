# Create and provision a simulated device using IoT Hub Device Provisioning Services (Python)
> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [TPM](python-quick-create-simulated-device.md)
> * [X.509](quick-create-simulated-device-x509.md)

These steps show how to create a simulated device on your development machine running Windows OS, run the Windows TPM simulator as the [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-iot-supports-new-security-hardware-to-strengthen-iot-security/) of the device, and use the code sample to connect this simulated device with the Device Provisioning Service and your IoT hub. 

Make sure to complete the steps in the [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before you proceed.

> [!NOTE]
    > Be sure to note your _Id Scope_ and _Provisioning Service Global Endpoint_ for use later in this Quickstart.

## Prepare the development environment 

1. Make sure you have either [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/) or [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) installed on your machine. You must have 'Desktop development with C++' workload enabled for your Visual Studio installation.

1. Download and install the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).

1. Make sure `git` is installed on your machine and is added to the environment variables accessible to the command window. See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/download/) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes the **Git Bash**, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository. 

1. Open a command prompt or Git Bash. Clone the GitHub repo for device simulation code sample:
    
    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git --recursive
    ```

1. Create a folder in your local copy of this GitHub repo for CMake build process. 

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-python/c
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

1. The code sample uses a Windows TPM simulator. Run the following command to enable the SAS token authentication. It also generates a Visual Studio solution for the simulated device.

    ```cmd/sh
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON ..
    ```

1. In a separate command prompt, navigate to the GitHub root folder and run the [TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/device-security/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview) simulator. It listens over a socket on ports 2321 and 2322. Do not close this command window; you will need to keep this simulator running until the end of this Quickstart guide. 

    ```cmd/sh
    .\azure-iot-sdk-python\c\provisioning_client\deps\utpm\tools\tpm_simulator\Simulator.exe
    ```


## Create a device enrollment entry in the Device Provisioning Service

1. Open the solution generated in the *cmake* folder named `azure_iot_sdks.sln`, and build it in Visual Studio.

1. Right-click the **tpm_device_provision** project and select **Set as Startup Project**. Run the solution. The output window displays the **_Endorsement Key_** and the **_Registration ID_** needed for device enrollment. Note down these values. 

1. Log in to the Azure portal, click on the **All resources** button on the left-hand menu and open your Device Provisioning service.

1. On the Device Provisioning Service summary blade, select **Manage enrollments**. Select **Individual Enrollments** tab and click the **Add** button at the top. 

1. Under the **Add enrollment list entry**, enter the following information:
    - Select **TPM** as the identity attestation *Mechanism*.
    - Enter the *Registration ID* and *Endorsement key* for your TPM device. 
    - Select an IoT hub linked with your provisioning service.
    - Enter a unique device ID. Make sure to avoid sensitive data while naming your device.
    - Update the **Initial device twin state** with the desired initial configuration for the device.
    - Once complete, click the **Save** button. 

    ![Enter device enrollment information in the portal blade](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/enter-device-enrollment.png)  

   On successful enrollment, the *Registration ID* of your device will appear in the list under the *Individual Enrollments* tab.

## Simulate first boot sequence for the device

1. Download and install [Python 2.x or 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to use the 32-bit or 64-bit installation as required by your setup. When prompted during the installation, make sure to add Python to your platform-specific environment variable. If you are using Python 2.x, you may need to [install or upgrade *pip*, the Python package management system][lnk-install-pip].
    - If you are using Windows OS, then [Visual C++ redistributable package][lnk-visual-c-redist] to allow the use of native DLLs from Python.

1. Open a command prompt or Git Bash. Clone the GitHub repo for device simulation code sample.
    
    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git --recursive
    ```

1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/doc/python-devbox-setup.md) to build the Python packages or proceed with the following manual steps:
    - Download [Boost](http://www.boost.org/users/download/) and extract the files.
        - Open a Visual Studio command prompt, navigate to the _boost\_{version}_ folder, and run the following commands:
            - `boostrap.bat`
            - `bjam` or `bjam address-model=64` for 64-bit
        - Set an enviornment variable **BOOST\_ROOT** to the Boost's folder location
    - Download [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/) and extract the files.
        - Set the following environment variables to the OpenSSL's folder location: **OpenSSLDir**, **OPENSSL\_CONF**, and **OPENSSL\_ROOT\_DIR**
    - Navigate to _azure-iot-sdk-python/build\_all/windows_
        - Run the command `build_client --use_tpm_simulator`

1. Navigate to the samples folder.

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-python/provisioning_device_client/samples
    ```

1. Using your Python IDE, edit the python script named **provisioning\_device\_client\_sample.py**. Modify the _GLOBAL\_PROV\_URI_ and _ID\_SCOPE_ variables to the values noted previously.

    ```python
    GLOBAL_PROV_URI = "{globalServiceEndpoint}"
    ID_SCOPE = "{idScope}"
    SECURITY_DEVICE_TYPE = ProvisioningSecurityDeviceType.TPM
    PROTOCOL = ProvisioningTransportProvider.HTTP
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
        > You can choose one of available protocols [HTTPS, AMQP, MQTT, AMQP_WS, MQTT_WS] for registration.

1. Run the sample. 

    ```cmd/sh
    python provisioning_device_client_sample.py
    ```

1. Notice the messages that simulate the device booting and connecting to the Device Provisioning Service to get your IoT hub information. On successful provisioning of your simulated device to the IoT hub linked with your provisioning service, the device ID appears on the hub's **Device Explorer** blade. 

    ![Device is registered with the IoT hub](./media/python-quick-create-simulated-device/hub-registration.png) 

    If you changed the *initial device twin state* from the default value in the enrollment entry for your device, it can pull the desired twin state from the hub and act accordingly. For more information, see [Understand and use device twins in IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md)


## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue working on and exploring the device client sample, do not clean up the resources created in this Quickstart. If you do not plan to continue, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this Quickstart.

1. Close the device client sample output window on your machine.
1. Close the TPM simulator window on your machine.
1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **All resources** and then select your Device Provisioning service. At the top of the **All resources** blade, click **Delete**.  
1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **All resources** and then select your IoT hub. At the top of the **All resources** blade, click **Delete**.  

## Next steps

In this Quickstart, youâ€™ve created a TPM simulated device on your machine and provisioned it to your IoT hub using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. To learn about device provisioning in depth, continue to the tutorial for the Device Provisioning Service setup in the Azure portal.
