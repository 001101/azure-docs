# Set up a device to provision using Azure IoT DPS

In the previous tutorial, you learned how to set up the Azure IoT DPS to automatically provision your devices to your IoT hub. This tutorial provides guidance for setting up your device during the manufacturing process, so that you can configure the IoT DPS for your device based on its [Hardware Security Module (HSM)]https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-iot-supports-new-security-hardware-to-strengthen-iot-security/), and the device can connect to the IoT DPS when it boots for the first time. Using a device simulator, this tutorial shows you how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a simulated device
> * Select and prepare an HSM
> * Implement security mechanism
> * Extract the security artefacts
> * Set up DPS configuration on the device


## Create a simulated device


## Select and prepare an HSM


## Implement security mechanism


## Extract the security artefacts


## Set up DPS configuration on the device


## Clean up resources
<----! ToDo: Clean up or delete any Azure work that may incur costs --->

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you learned how to:

> * Create a simulated device
> * Select and prepare an HSM
> * Implement security mechanism
> * Extract the security artefacts
> * Set up DPS configuration on the device

Advance to the next tutorial to learn how to provision the device to your IoT hub by enrolling it to IoT DPS for auto-provisioning.

<---! ToDo: 
Rules for screenshots:
- Use default Public Portal colors
- Browser included in the first shot (especially) but all shots if possible
- Resize the browser to minimize white space
- Include complete blades in the screenshots
- Linux: Safari â€“ consider context in images
Guidelines for outlining areas within screenshots:
	- Red outline #ef4836
	- 3px thick outline
	- Text should be vertically centered within the outline.
	- Length of outline should be dependent on where it sits within the screenshot. Make the shape fit the layout of the screenshot.
