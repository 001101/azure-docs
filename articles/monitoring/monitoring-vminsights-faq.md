## Azure Monitor VM Insights Frequently Asked Questions
This Microsoft FAQ is a list of commonly asked questions about Azure Monitor VM Insights in Microsoft Azure. If you have any additional questions about the solution, go to the [discussion forum](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/34192--general-feedback) and post your questions. When a question is frequently asked, we add it to this article so that it can be found quickly and easily.

## Can I onboard to an existing workspace?
If your virtual machines are already connected to a Log Analytics workspace, you may continue to use that workspace when onboarding to VM Insights, provided it is in one of the supported regions listed [here](monitoring-vminsights-onboard.md#prerequisites).

When onboarding to VM Insights, we configure performance counters for the workspace that will cause all of the VMs reporting data to the workspace to begin logging this information for display and analysis in VM Insights.  This means that you will see performance data from all of the VMs connected to the selected workspace.  The Health and Map features will only be enabled for the VMs that you have specified to onboard to VM Insights.

For more information on which performance counters are enabled, please refer to our [onboarding](monitoring-vminsights-onboard.md) article.

## Can I onboard to a new workspace? 
If your VMs are not currently connected to an existing Log Analytics workspace, you need to create a new workspace to store your data.  This is done automatically if you configure a single Azure VM for VM Insights through the Azure portal.

If you choose to use the script-based method, these steps are covered in the [onboarding](monitoring-vminsights-onboard.md) article. 

## What do I do if my VM is already reporting to an existing workspace?
If you are already collecting data from your virtual machines you may have already configured it to report data to an existing Log Analytics workspace.  As long as that workspace is in one of our supported regions you can enable VM Insights to that pre-existing workspace.  If the workspace you are already using is not in one of our supported regions you won’t be able to onboard to VM Insights at this time.  We are actively working to support additional regions.

>[!NOTE]
>We configure performance counters for the workspace that affects all VMs that report to the   workspace, whether or not you have chosen to onboard them to VM Insights. For more details on how performance counters are configured for the workspace, please refer to our [documentation](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources-performance-counters.md). For information about the counters configured for VM Insights, please refer to our [onboarding documentation](monitoring-vminsights-onboard.md#performance-counters-enabled).  

## Why did my VM fail to onboard?
When onboarding an Azure VM from the Azure portal, the following steps occur:

* A default Log Analytics workspace is created, if that option was selected.
* The performance counters are configured for selected workspace. If this step fails, you notice that some of the performance charts and tables aren't showing data for the VM you onboarded. You can fix this by running the PowerShell script documented [here](monitoring-vminsights-onboard.md#enable-with-powershell).
* The Log Analytics agent is installed on Azure VMs using the VM extension, if determined it is required.  
* The VM Insights Map Dependency agent is installed on Azure VMs using the extension, if determined it is required.  
* Azure Monitor components supporting the Health feature are configured, if needed, and the VM is configured to report health data.

During the onboard process, we check for status on each of the above to return a notification status to you in the portal.  Configuration of the workspace and the agent installation typically takes 5 to 10 minutes.  Viewing monitoring and health data in the portal take an additional 5 to 10 minutes.  

If you have initiated onboarding and see messages indicating the VM needs to be onboarded,  allow for up to 30 minutes for the VM to complete the process. 

## I don’t see some or any data in the performance charts for my VM
If you don’t see performance data in the disk table or in some of the performance charts then your performance counters may not be configured in the workspace. To fix this, run the following [PowerShell script](monitoring-vminsights-onboard.md#enable-with-powershell).

## How is VM Insights Map feature different from Service Map?
The VM Insights Map feature is based on Service Map, but has the following differences:

* The Map view can be accessed from the VM blade and from VM insights under Azure Monitor.
* The connections in the Map are now clickable and display a view of the connection metric data in the side panel for the selected connection.
* There is a new API that is used to create the maps to better support more complex maps.
* Monitored VMs are now included in the client group node, and the donut chart shows the proportion of monitored vs unmonitored virtual machines in the group.  It can also be used to filter the list of machines when the group is expanded.
* Monitored virtual machines are now included in the server port group nodes, and the donut chart shows the proportion of monitored vs unmonitored machines in the group.  It can also be used to filter the list of machines when the group is expanded.
* The map style has been updated to be more consistent with App Map from Application Insights.
* The side panels have been updated, but do not yet have the full set of integration's that were supported in Service Map - Update Management, Change Tracking, Security, and Service Desk. 
* The option for choosing groups and machines to map has been updated and now supports Subscriptions, Resource Groups, VM scale sets, Service fabric clusters, and Cloud services.
* You cannot create new Service Map machine groups in the VM Insights Map feature.  
 
## Are groups supported with VM Insights?
The Performance feature supports groups based on Subscription, Resource Group, Computer Group, Service Map machine group, as well as grouping based on a particular Azure VM scale set, Service Fabric cluster, and Cloud service.

## How do I see the details for what is driving the 95th percentile line in the aggregate performance charts?
We are improving the drill down process for this, but in the near term we recommend that you select the **List** tab and then choose the metric that you are interested in. By default, the list will be sorted to show you the VMs that have the highest value for the 95th percentile for the selected metric.

## Why do some rows in the list view have more icons that other rows?
The icons are displayed dynamically, based on what features from VM Insights the particular VM has enabled.

* VM blade icon – when the Dependency agent is installed and detects it's installed on an Azure VM
* VM Insights icon – displayed for all rows
* Map icon – when the dependency agent is installed

## How does the Map feature handle duplicate IPs across different vnets and subnets?
If you are duplicating IP ranges either with VMs or Azure VM scale sets across subnets and vnets, it can cause VM Insights Map to display incorrect information. This is a known issue and we are investigating options to improve this experience.

## Does Map feature support IPv6?
Map feature currently only supports IPv4 and we are investigating support for IPv6. 

## When I load a map for a Resource Group or other large group the map is difficult to view
While we have made improvements to Map to handle large and complex configurations, we realize a map can have a lot of nodes, connections, and node working as a cluster.  We are committed to continuing to enhance support to increase scalability.
