# Data collection details for management solutions in Azure

The following table lists the [management solutions](monitoring-solutions.md) in Azure provided by Microsoft.  It also includes information on the frequency and method of data collection for each solution.  You can use this information to determine the data flow and connection requirements for different management solutions.Follow the link for each one to its detailed documentation for more information.

The table at the bottom of the page describes the columns in this table.

| Column | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Management Solution | The management solution collecting the data. |
| Platform | Platform that the solution is collecting from.  If it collects from an agent, then this is the operating system the agent is installed on. |
| Microsoft monitoring agent | Agent used on Windows and Linux to run managements pack from SCOM and management solutions from Azure.  In this configuration, the agent is connected directly to Log Analytics without being connected to a SCOM management group. |
| Operations Manager         | Identical agent as Microsoft monitoring agent.  In this configuration, it's [connected to a SCOM management group](../log-analytics/log-analytics-om-agents.md) that's connected to Log Analytics. |
| Azure Storage | Solution collects data from an Azure storage account. |
| Operations Manager required? | A connected SCOM management group is required for data collection by the management solution. |
| Operations Manager agent data sent via management group | If the agent is [connected to a SCOM management group](../log-analytics-om-agents.md), then data is sent to Log Analytics from the management server.  In this case, the agent doesn't need to connect directly to Log Analytics.  If this box isn't selected, then data is sent from the agent directly to Log Analytics even if the agent is connected to a SCOM management group.  it will either need to be able to communicate to Log Analytics through an [OMS gateway](../log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-gateway.md).
| Collection frequency| Specifies the frequency that data is collected by the management solution. |

<sup>1</sup> The Security and Audit solution can collect logs from Windows, Operations Manager, and Linux agents. See [Data sources](#data-sources) for data collection information about:

- Windows event logs

The following table describes the columns above.

| Column | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Management Solution | The management solution collecting the data. |
