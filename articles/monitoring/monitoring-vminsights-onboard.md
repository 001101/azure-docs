# How to onboard the Azure Monitor VM Insights 
This article describes how to set up VM Insights to monitor the operating system health of your Azure virtual machines and discover and map application dependencies that may be hosted on them.  

Enabling VM Insights is accomplished by using one of the following methods and details on using each method are provided later in the article.  

* A single Azure virtual machine by selecting VM Insights directly from the VM.
* Multiple Azure VMs or virtual machine scale sets using Azure Policy to ensure existing and new VMs evaluated have the required dependencies installed and are properly configured.  Non-compliant VMs are reported so you can take steps to remediate based on your configuration management requirements.  
* Multiple Azure VMs or virtual machine scale sets across a specified subscription or resource group using PowerShell.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure that you have the following as described in the sub-sections below.

### Log Analytics 

A Log Analytics workspace in the following regions are currently supported:

  - West Central US  
  - East US  
  - West Europe  
  - Southeast Asia<sup>1</sup>  

<sup>1</sup> 
This region does not currently support the Health feature of VM Insights.   

If you do not have a workspace, you can you can create it through [Azure Resource Manager](../log-analytics/log-analytics-template-workspace-configuration.md), through [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/scripts/log-analytics-powershell-sample-create-workspace?toc=%2fpowershell%2fmodule%2ftoc.json), or in the [Azure portal](../log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace.md).  

To enable the solution, you need to be a member of the Log Analytics contributor role. For more information about how to control access to a Log Analytics workspace, see [Manage workspaces](../log-analytics/log-analytics-manage-access.md).

[!INCLUDE [log-analytics-agent-note](../../includes/log-analytics-agent-note.md)]

### Supported operating systems

The following versions of the Windows and Linux operating systems are officially supported with VM Insights:

|OS version |Performance |Maps |Health |  
|-----------|------------|-----|-------|  
|Windows Server 2016 | X | X | X |  
|Windows Server 2012 R2 | X | X | |  
|Windows Server 2012 | X | X | |  
|Windows Server 2008 R2 | X | X| |  
|RHEL 7, 6| X | X| X |  
|Ubuntu 16.04, 14.04 | X | X| X |  
|Cent OS Linux 7, 6 | X | X| X |  
|SLES 12 | X | X | X |  
|SLES 11 | X | X | X |  
|Oracle Linux 7 | X | | X |  
|Oracle Linux 6 | X | X | X |  
|Debian 9.4, 8 | X | | X | 

### Hybrid environment connected sources
VM Insights Map gets its data from the Microsoft Dependency agent. The Dependency agent relies on the Log Analytics agent for its connection to Log Analytics. This means that a system must have the Log Analytics agent installed and configured with the Dependency agent.  The following table describes the connected sources that the Map feature supports in a hybrid environment.

| Connected source | Supported | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Windows agents | Yes | In addition to the [Log Analytics agent for Windows](../log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid.md), Windows agents require the Microsoft Dependency agent. See the [supported operating systems](#supported-operating-systems) for a complete list of operating system versions. |
| Linux agents | Yes | In addition to the [Log Analytics agent for Linux](../log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid.md), Linux agents require the Microsoft Dependency agent. See the [supported operating systems](#supported-operating-systems) for a complete list of operating system versions. |
| System Center Operations Manager management group | No | |  

On Windows, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) is used by both System Center Operations Manager and Log Analytics to gather and send monitoring data. System Center Operations Manager and Log Analytics provide different out-of-the box versions of the agent. These versions can each report to System Center Operations Manager, to Log Analytics, or to both.  

On Linux, the Log Analytics agent for Linux gathers and sends monitoring data to Log Analytics. You can use Map on servers with Log Analytics agents connected directly to the service, or that are reporting to an Operations Manager management group integrated with Log Analytics.  

If your Windows or Linux computers cannot directly connect to the service, you need to configure the Log Analytics agent to connect to Log Analytics using the OMS Gateway. For further information on how to deploy and configure the OMS Gateway, see [Connect computers without Internet access using the OMS Gateway](../log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-gateway.md).  

The Dependency agent can be downloaded from the following location.

| File | OS | Version | SHA-256 |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| [InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe](https://aka.ms/dependencyagentwindows) | Windows | 9.5.0 | 8B8FE0F6B0A9F589C4B7B52945C2C25DF008058EB4D4866DC45EE2485062C9D7 |
| [InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin](https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux) | Linux | 9.5.1 | 09D56EF43703A350FF586B774900E1F48E72FE3671144B5C99BB1A494C201E9E |

## Diagnostic and usage data
Microsoft automatically collects usage and performance data through your use of the Azure Monitor service. Microsoft uses this data to provide and improve the quality, security, and integrity of the service. To provide accurate and efficient troubleshooting capabilities, data from the Map feature includes information about the configuration of your software, such as operating system and version, IP address, DNS name, and workstation name. Microsoft does not collect names, addresses, or other contact information.

## Enable using Azure Policy
To enable the solution for multiple Azure VMs that ensures consistent compliance and automatic enablement for new VMs provisioned, [Azure Policy](../azure-policy/azure-policy-introduction.md) is recommended.  Using Azure Policy with the policies provided delivers the following benefits for new VMs:

* Enabling VM Insights for each VM in the defined scope
* Deploy Log Analytics Agent and configure performance collection rules to measure  performance utilization
* Deploy Dependency Agent to discover application dependencies and show in the Map
* Audit if your Azure VM OS image is in a pre-defined list in policy definition  
* Audit if your Azure VM  is logging to workspace other than one specified
* Report on compliance results 
* Support remediation for non-compliant VMs

To activate it for your tenant, this process requires:

- Configure a Log Analytics Workspace using the steps listed here
- Import the initiative defintion to your tenant (at the Management Group or Subscription level)
- Assign the policy to the desired scope
- Review the compliance results

### Add the policies and initiative to your subscription
To use the policies, we have provided a script `Add-VMInsightsPolicy.ps1` which adds the policies and an initiative to your subscription.  Perform the following steps to configure Azure Policy in your subscription. 

1. Download the PowerShell script to your local file system by running the following commands:

    ```powershell  
    $client = new-object System.Net.WebClient  
    $client.DownloadFile(“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/Policy/Policy/Add-VMInsightsPolicy.ps1”,“Add-VMInsightsPolicy.ps1”)  
    ```  

2. Use the following PowerShell command in the folder to add policies. The script supports the following optional parameters: 

    ```powershell
    -UseLocalPolicies [<SwitchParameter>]
      <Optional> Load the policies from a local folder instead of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/Policy/Policy/

    -SubscriptionId <String>
      <Optional> SubscriptionId to add the Policies/Initiatives to
    -ManagementGroupId <String>
      <Optional> Management Group Id to add the Policies/Initiatives to

    -Approve [<SwitchParameter>]
      <Optional> Gives the approval to add the Policies/Initiatives without any prompt
    ```  

    >[!NOTE]
    >Note: If you plan to assign the initiative/policy to multiple subscriptions, the definitions must be stored in the management group that contains the subscriptions you will assign the policy to. Therefore you must use the -ManagementGroupID parameter.
    >
   
    Example without parameters:  `.\Add-VMInsightsPolicy.ps1`

### Create a policy assignment
After you run the `Add-VMInsightsPolicy.ps1` PowerShell script, the following initiative and policies are added:

**Enable VM Insights for VMs Preview**  
- **Deploy Log Analytics Agent for Windows VMs Preview**  
- **Deploy Log Analytics Agent for Linux VMs Preview**  
- **Deploy Dependency Agent for Windows VMs Preview**  
- **Deploy Dependency Agent for Linux VMs Preview**  
- **VMs not in OS scope of Log Analytics Agent deployment policy Preview**  
- **VMs not in OS scope of Dependency Agent deployment policy Preview**  

The following initiative parameter is added:

- **Log Analytice Workspace (You have to provide the ResourceID of the workspace if applying an assignment using PowerShell or CLI)

    For VMs found as not-compliant from the audit policies **VMs not in OS scope...** the criteria of the deployment policy only includes VMs that are deployed from well-known Azure VM images. Check the documentation if the VM OS is supported or not.  If it is not, then you will need to duplicate the deployment policy and update/modify it to make the image in scope.

The following standalone optional policy is added:

- **VM is configured for mismatched Log Analytics Workspace - Preview**

    This can be used to identify VMs already configured with the [Log Analytics VM Extension](../virtual-machines/extensions/oms-windows.md), but are configured with a different Workspace than intended (as indicated by the policy assignment). This takes a parameter for the WorkspaceID.

With this initial release, you can only create the policy assignment from the Azure portal. To understand how to complete these steps, see [Create a policy assignment from the Azure portal](../azure-policy/assign-policy-definition.md).

## Enable from the Azure portal
To enable monitoring of your Azure VM in the Azure portal, do the following:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Virtual Machines**. 
2. From the list, select a VM. 
3. On the VM page, in the **Monitoring** section, select **Insights (preview)**.
4. On the **Insights (preview)** page, select **Try VM Insights**.

    ![Enable VM Insights for a VM](./media/monitoring-vminsights-onboard/onboard-vminsights-vm-portal.png)

5. On the **Azure Monitor Insights Onboarding** page, if you have an existing Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription, select it in the drop-down list.  The list preselects the default workspace and location that the virtual machine is deployed to in the subscription. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you want to create a new Log Analytics workspace for storing the monitoring data from the VM, follow the instructions in [Create a Log Analytics workspace](../log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace.md). Be sure to create the workspace in the same subscription that the VM is deployed to. 

After you've enabled monitoring, it might take about 10 minutes before you can view health metrics for the virtual machine. 

![Enable VM Insights monitoring deployment processing](./media/monitoring-vminsights-onboard/onboard-vminsights-vm-portal-status.png)

## Enable with PowerShell
To enable VM Insights for multiple VMs or VM scale sets, you can use a provided PowerShell script - [Install-VMInsights.ps1](https://github.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/blob/master/Install-VMInsights.ps1) to complete this task.  This script will iterate through every virtual machine and VM scale set in your subscription, in the scoped resource group specified by *ResourceGroup*, or to a single VM or scale set specified by *Name*.  For each VM or VM scale set the script verifies if the VM extension is already installed, and if not attempt to reinstall it.  Otherwise, it proceeds to install the Log Analytics and Dependency Agent VM extensions.   

This script requires Azure PowerShell module version 5.7.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

To download the PowerShell script to your local file system, run the following commands:

```powershell
$client = new-object System.Net.WebClient
$client.DownloadFile(“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/master/Install-VMInsights.ps1”,“Install-VMInsights.ps1”) 
```

To get help about the script, you can run `Get-Help` to get a list of argument details and example usage.   

```powershell
Get-Help .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -Detailed

## Enable for Hybrid environment
This section explains how to onboard virtual machines or physical computers hosted in your datacenter or other cloud environment for monitoring by VM Insights.  

The VM Insights Map Dependency agent does not transmit any data itself, and it does not require any changes to firewalls or ports. The data in Map is always transmitted by the Log Analytics agent to the Azure Monitor service, either directly or through the [OMS Gateway](../log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-gateway.md) if your IT security policies do not allow computers on the network to connect to the Internet.

Review the requirements and deployment methods for the [Log Analytics Linux and Windows agent](../log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid.md).

Summarized steps:

1. Install Log Analytics Agent for Windows or Linux
2. Install VM Insights Dependency agent
3. Enable collection of performance counters
4. Onboard VM Insights solution

### Install the Dependency agent on Windows 
The Dependency agent can be installed manually on Windows computers by running  `InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe`. If you run this executable file without any options, it starts a setup wizard that you can follow to install interactively.  

>[!NOTE]
>Administrator privileges are required to install or uninstall the agent.

The following table highlights the specific parameters supported by setup for the agent from the command line.  

| Parameter | Description |
|:--|:--|
| /? | Returns a list of the command-line options. |
| /S | Perform a silent installation with no user interaction. |

For example, to run the installation program with the `/?` parameter, type `InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe /?`

Files for the Windows Dependency agent are installed in `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dependency Agent` by default.  If the Dependency agent fails to start after setup is complete, check the logs for detailed error information. The log directory is `%Programfiles%\Microsoft Dependency Agent\logs`. 

### Install the Dependency agent on Linux
The Dependency agent is installed on Linux servers from `InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin`, a shell script with a self-extracting binary. You can run the file by using `sh` or add execute permissions to the file itself.

>[!NOTE]
> Root access is required to install or configure the agent.
> 

| Parameter | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -help | Get a list of the command-line options. |
| -s | Perform a silent installation with no user prompts. |
| --check | Check permissions and the operating system but do not install the agent. |

For example, to run the installation program with the `-help` parameter, type `InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -help`.

Install the Linux Dependency agent as root by running the following command, `sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin`
    
If the Dependency agent fails to start, check the logs for detailed error information. On Linux agents, the log directory is `/var/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/log`.

Files for the Dependency agent are placed in the following directories:

| Files | Location |
|:--|:--|
| Core files | /opt/microsoft/dependency-agent |
| Log files | /var/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/log |
| Config files | /etc/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/config |
| Service executable files | /opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/bin/microsoft-dependency-agent<br>/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/bin/microsoft-dependency-agent-manager |
| Binary storage files | /var/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/storage |

### Enable performance counters
If the Log Analytics workspace referenced by the solution isn't configured to already collect the performance counters required by the solution, they will need to be enabled. This can be accomplished manually as described [here](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources-performance-counters.md), or by downloading and running a PowerShell script hosted on our GitHub [repo](https://github.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/blob/master/Enable-VMInsightsPerfCounters.ps1) for the solution.
 
### Onboard the solution
This method includes a JSON template that specifies the configuration to enable the solution components to your Log Analytics workspace.  

If you are unfamiliar with the concept of deploying resources by using a template, see:
* [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure PowerShell](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md)
* [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and the Azure CLI](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-cli.md) 

If you choose to use the Azure CLI, you first need to install and use the CLI locally. You must be running the Azure CLI version 2.0.27 or later. To identify your version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade the Azure CLI, see [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

#### Create and execute a template

1. Copy and paste the following JSON syntax into your file:

    ```json

                        "product": "[Concat('OMSGallery/', 'ServiceMap')]",
                        "promotionCode": ""
                    }
                },
                {
                    "apiVersion": "2015-11-01-preview",
                    "location": "[parameters('WorkspaceLocation')]",
                    "name": "[concat('InfrastructureInsights', '(', parameters('WorkspaceName'),')')]",
                    "type": "Microsoft.OperationsManagement/solutions",
                    "dependsOn": [
                        "[concat('Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/', parameters('WorkspaceName'))]"
                    ],
                    "properties": {
                        "workspaceResourceId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/', parameters('WorkspaceName'))]"
                    },
                    "plan": {
                        "name": "[concat('InfrastructureInsights', '(', parameters('WorkspaceName'),')')]",
                        "publisher": "Microsoft",
                        "product": "[Concat('OMSGallery/', 'InfrastructureInsights')]",
                        "promotionCode": ""
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    ```

2. Save this file as **installsolutionsforvminsights.json** to a local folder.
3. Edit the values for **WorkspaceName**, **ResourceGroupName**, and **WorkspaceLocation**.
