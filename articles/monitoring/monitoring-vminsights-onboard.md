# How to onboard the Azure Monitor VM Insights 
This article describes how to set up VM Insights to monitor the operating system health of your Azure virtual machines and discover and map application dependencies that may be hosted on them.  

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure that you have the following as described in the sub-sections below.

### Hybrid environment connected sources
VM Insights Map gets its data from the Microsoft Dependency agent. The Dependency agent relies on the Log Analytics agent for its connection to Log Analytics. This means that a system must have the Log Analytics agent installed and configured with the Dependency agent.  The following table describes the connected sources that the Service Map solution supports in a hybrid environment.

| Connected source | Supported | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Windows agents | Yes | In addition to the [Log Analytics agent for Windows](../log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid.md), Windows agents require the Microsoft Dependency agent. See the [supported operating systems](#supported-operating-systems) for a complete list of operating system versions. |
| Linux agents | Yes | In addition to the [Log Analytics agent for Linux](../log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid.md), Linux agents require the Microsoft Dependency agent. See the [supported operating systems](#supported-operating-systems) for a complete list of operating system versions. |
| System Center Operations Manager management group | Yes | VM Insights Map analyzes and collects data from Windows and Linux agents in a connected [System Center Operations Manager management group](../log-analytics/log-analytics-om-agents.md). <br><br>A direct connection from the System Center Operations Manager agent computer to Log Analytics is required. |  

On Windows, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) is used by both System Center Operations Manager and Log Analytics to gather and send monitoring data. System Center Operations Manager and Log Analytics provide different out-of-the box versions of the MMA. These versions can each report to System Center Operations Manager, to Log Analytics, or to both.  

On Linux, the Log Analytics agent for Linux gathers and sends monitoring data to Log Analytics. You can use Map on servers with Log Analytics agents connected directly to the service, or that are reporting to an Operations Manager management group integrated with Log Analytics.  

If you are a System Center Operations Manager customer with a management group connected to Log Analytics:

- If your System Center Operations Manager agents can access the Internet to connect to Log Analytics, no additional configuration is required.  
- If your System Center Operations Manager agents cannot access Log Analytics over the Internet, you need to configure the OMS Gateway to work with System Center Operations Manager.
  
If your Windows or Linux computers cannot directly connect to the service, you need to configure the Log Analytics agent to connect to Log Analytics using the OMS Gateway. For further information on how to deploy and configure the OMS Gateway, see [Connect computers without Internet access using the OMS Gateway](../log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-gateway.md).  

### Dependency agent
To monitor physical or virtual machines in a hybrid environment with VM Insights Map, you need to install the Dependency agent. The agent can be downloaded from the following location.

| File | OS | Version | SHA-256 |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| [InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe](https://aka.ms/dependencyagentwindows) | Windows | 9.5.0 | 8B8FE0F6B0A9F589C4B7B52945C2C25DF008058EB4D4866DC45EE2485062C9D7 |
| [InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin](https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux) | Linux | 9.5.1 | 09D56EF43703A350FF586B774900E1F48E72FE3671144B5C99BB1A494C201E9E |

### Log Analytics 

1. A Log Analytics workspace in the following regions are currently supported:

   - West Central US
   - East US
   - West Europe
   - Southeast Asia<sup>1</sup>  

    <sup>1</sup> 
    This region does not support the Health feature of VM Insights and it will be available at a later date.   

    If you do not have a workspace, you can you can create it through [Azure Resource Manager](../log-analytics/log-analytics-template-workspace-configuration.md), through [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/scripts/log-analytics-powershell-sample-create-workspace?toc=%2fpowershell%2fmodule%2ftoc.json), or in the [Azure portal](../log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace.md).  

2. The Log Analytics contributor role, to enable the solution. For more information about how to control access to a Log Analytics workspace, see [Manage workspaces](../log-analytics/log-analytics-manage-access.md).

## Diagnostic and usage data
Microsoft automatically collects usage and performance data through your use of the Azure Monitor service. Microsoft uses this data to provide and improve the quality, security, and integrity of the service. To provide accurate and efficient troubleshooting capabilities, data from the Map feature includes information about the configuration of your software, such as operating system and version, IP address, DNS name, and workstation name. Microsoft does not collect names, addresses, or other contact information.

For more information about data collection and usage, see the [Microsoft Online Services Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=512132).

## Enable from the Azure portal
To enable monitoring of your Azure VM in the Azure portal, do the following:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Virtual Machines**. 
2. From the list, select a VM. 
3. On the VM page, in the **Monitoring** section, select **Insights (preview)**.
4. On the **Insights (preview)** page, select **Try VM Insights**.

    ![Enable VM Insights for a VM](./media/monitoring-vminsights-onboard/enable-vminsights-vm-portal-01.png)

5. On the **Azure Monitor Insights Onboarding** page, if you have an existing Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription, select it in the drop-down list.  

    The list preselects the default workspace and location that the virtual machine is deployed to in the subscription. 

    ![Enable VM Insights monitoring select workspace option](./media/monitoring-vminsights-onboard/enable-vminsights-vm-portal-02.png)

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to create a new Log Analytics workspace for storing the monitoring data from the VM, follow the instructions in [Create a Log Analytics workspace](../log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace.md). Be sure to create the workspace in the same subscription that the VM is deployed to. 

After you've enabled monitoring, it might take about 15 minutes before you can view health metrics for the virtual machine.

## Enable with PowerShell
To onboard multiple VMs or VM Scale Sets, you use a provided PowerShell script - [Install-VMInsights.ps1](https://github.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/blob/master/Install-VMInsights.ps1) to complete this task.  This script will iterate through every virtual machine and VM Scale Set in your subscription, in the scoped resource group specified by *ResourceGroup*, or to a single VM or Scale Set specified by *Name*.  For each VM or VM Scale Set, the script verifies if the VM extension is already installed, and if not attempt to reinstall it.  Otherwise, it proceeds to install the Log Analytics and Dependency Agent VM extensions.   

This script requires Azure PowerShell module version 5.7.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

To download the PowerShell script to your local file system, run the following commands:

```posh
$client = new-object System.Net.WebClient
$client.DownloadFile(“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/master/Install-VMInsights.ps1”,“Install-VMInsights.ps1”) 
```

To get Help about the script, you can run `Get-Help` to get a list of argument details and example usage.   

```powershell
Get-Help .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -Detailed

## Enable for Hybrid environment
This section explains how to onboard virtual machines or physical computers hosted in your datacenter or other cloud environment.  

The VM Insights Map Dependency agent does not transmit any data itself, and it does not require any changes to firewalls or ports. The data in Map is always transmitted by the Log Analytics agent to the Azure Monitor service, either directly or through the [OMS Gateway](../log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-gateway.md) if your IT security policies do not allow computers on the network to connect to the Internet.

Review the requirements and deployment methods for the [Log Analytics Linux and Windows agent](../log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid.md).

### Install the Dependency agent on Windows 
The Dependency agent can be installed manually on Windows computers by running  `InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe`. If you run this executable file without any options, it starts a setup wizard that you can follow to install interactively.  

>[!NOTE]
>Administrator privileges are required to install or uninstall the agent.

The following table highlights the specific parameters supported by setup for the agent from the command line.  

| Parameter | Description |
|:--|:--|
| /? | Returns a list of the command-line options. |
| /S | Perform a silent installation with no user interaction. |

For example, to run the installation program with the `/?` parameter, type `InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe /?`

Files for the Windows Dependency agent are installed in `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dependency Agent` by default.  If the Dependency agent fails to start after setup is complete, check the logs for detailed error information. The log directory is `%Programfiles%\Microsoft Dependency Agent\logs`. 

### Install the Dependency agent on Linux
The Dependency agent is installed on Linux servers from `InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin`, a shell script with a self-extracting binary. You can run the file by using `sh` or add execute permissions to the file itself.

>[!NOTE]
> Root access is required to install or configure the agent.
> 

| Parameter | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -help | Get a list of the command-line options. |
| -s | Perform a silent installation with no user prompts. |
| --check | Check permissions and the operating system but do not install the agent. |

For example, to run the installation program with the `-help` parameter, type `InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -help`.

Install the Linux Dependency agent as root by running the following command, `sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin`
    
If the Dependency agent fails to start, check the logs for detailed error information. On Linux agents, the log directory is `/var/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/log`.

Files for the Dependency agent are placed in the following directories:

| Files | Location |
|:--|:--|
| Core files | /opt/microsoft/dependency-agent |
| Log files | /var/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/log |
| Config files | /etc/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/config |
| Service executable files | /opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/bin/microsoft-dependency-agent<br>/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/bin/microsoft-dependency-agent-manager |
| Binary storage files | /var/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/storage |
