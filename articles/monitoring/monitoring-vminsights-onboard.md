# How to onboard the Azure Monitor VM insights solution
This article describes how to set up VM insights to monitor the operating system health of your Azure virtual machines and discover and map application dependencies that may be hosted on them.  

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure that you have the following as described in the sub-sections below.
  
### Log Analytics 

1. A Log Analytics workspace in the following regions are currently supported:

   - West Central US  
   - East US
   - Southeast Asia (Health is not supported yet)
   - West Europe (Health is not supported yet)

    If you do not have a workspace, you can create it through [Azure Resource Manager](../log-analytics/log-analytics-template-workspace-configuration.md), through [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/scripts/log-analytics-powershell-sample-create-workspace?toc=%2fpowershell%2fmodule%2ftoc.json), or in the [Azure portal](../log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace.md).

2. The Log Analytics contributor role, to enable the solution. For more information about how to control access to a Log Analytics workspace, see [Manage workspaces](../log-analytics/log-analytics-manage-access.md).

### Supported Operating Systems

The following versions of the Windows and Linux operating systems are officially supported with VM Insights:

|OS Version |Performance |Maps |Health |  
|-----------|------------|-----|-------|  
|Windows Server 2016 | X | X | X |  
|Windows Server 2012 R2 | X | X | |  
|Windows Server 2012 | X | X | |  
|Windows Server 2008 R2 | X | X| |  
|RHEL 7, 6| X | X| X |  
|Ubuntu 16.04, 14.04 | X | X| X |  
|Cent OS Linux 7, 6 | X | X| X |  
|SLES 12 | X | | X |  
|SLES 11 | X | X | X |  
|Oracle Linux 7 | X | | X |  
|Oracle Linux 6 | X | X | X |  
|Debian 9.4, 8 | X | | X |  

## Default performance counters sampled
The solution samples a basic set of performance counters by default for the Windows and Linux operating system.  Below is a list that are configured for collection.

>[!NOTE]
>The collection interval for any newly added configuration is set to 60 seconds.

### Windows

| LogicalDisk | * | % Free Space |  
| LogicalDisk | * | Avg. Disk sec/Read |  
| LogicalDisk | * | Avg. Disk sec/Transfer |  
| LogicalDisk | * | Avg. Disk sec/Write |  
| LogicalDisk | * | Disk Bytes/sec |  
| LogicalDisk | * | Disk Read Bytes/sec |

For more information about Log Analytics performance counters, see [Data collection details for performance counters](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources-performance-counters.md).

## Enable from the Azure portal
To enable monitoring of your Azure VM in the Azure portal, do the following:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Virtual Machines**. 
2. In the list of VMs, select a virtual machine. 
3. 

## Enable with PowerShell
To onboard multiple VMs or VM Scale Sets, you use a provided PowerShell script - [Install-VMInsights.ps1](https://github.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/blob/master/Install-VMInsights.ps1) to complete this task.  This script will iterate through every virtual machine and VM Scale Set in your subscription, in the scoped resource group specified by *ResourceGroup*, or to a single VM or Scale Set specified by *Name*.  For each VM or VM Scale Set, the script verifies if the VM extension is already installed, and if not attempt to reinstall it.  Otherwise, it proceeds to install the Log Analytics and Dependency Agent VM extensions.   

This script requires Azure PowerShell module version 5.7.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

To download the PowerShell script to your local file system, run the following commands:

```posh
$client = new-object System.Net.WebClient
$client.DownloadFile(“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/master/Install-VMInsights.ps1”,“Install-VMInsights.ps1”) 
```

To get Help about the script, you can run `Get-Help` to get a list of argument details and example usage.   

```powershell
Get-Help .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -Detailed

SYNOPSIS
    Configure VM's and VM Scale Sets for VM Insights:
    - Installs Log Analytics VM Extension configured to supplied Log Analytics Workspace
    - Installs Dependency Agent VM Extension

    Can be applied to:
    - Subscription
    - Resource Group in a Subscription
    - Specific VM/VM Scale Set

    Script will show you list of VM's/VM Scale Sets that will apply to and let you confirm to continue.
    Use -Approve switch to run without prompting, if all required parameters are provided.

    If the extensions are already installed will not install again.
    Use -ReInstall switch if you need to for example update the workspace.

    Use -WhatIf if you would like to see what would happen in terms of installs, what workspace configured to, and status of the
    extension.
