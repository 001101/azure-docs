## Overview of Azure Monitor VM insights

Azure Monitor VM insights monitors your Azure virtual machines (VM) at scale by analyzing the performance and health of your Windows and Linux VMs, including their different processes and interconnected dependencies on other resources and external processes. It includes three key features to deliver this in-depth insight:
â€‹
* Understand guest-level performance by collecting key performance counters, including memory, processor, network adapter, and per logical disk metrics.
* Dependency map showing the discovered interconnected components with that VM from multiple resource groups and subscriptions
* Health state criteria for Azure VMs running Windows and Linux operating system

Integration with Log Analytics delivers powerful aggregation, filtering, and ability to perform trend analysis of the data over time. 

* List of benefits/value of this solution (each feature of it delivers value) versus just pulling telemetry using Azure Monitor/Log Analytics/Service Maps independently
 
You can view this data in the context of single instance of the VM from the virtual machine resource blade, and as an aggregated view of all VMs in your subscription from Azure Monitor.

DevOps can effectively deliver predictable performance and availability of vital applications by identifying critical operating system events and performance bottlenecks, network issues, and understand if an issue is related to other dependencies.  

Logical components of the operating system running on the VM, such as:

* core operating system services and features
* processor utilization
* memory utilization
* disk utilization, including logical disk perspective
* network adapter utilization 

are measured based on a set of pre-configured health criteria and alerts when the evaluated condition is met.  Core performance metrics from processor, memory, disk, and network adapter are collected and presented in pre-defined trending performance charts.

These charts help you understand resource utilization over a period time while investigating resource utilization issues detected or during proactive analysis.  

What are the financial factors to consider before enabling this solution?
What is the amount of data ingested per VM broken down by performance and health feature?
- This should probably be summarized in the deployment article.
