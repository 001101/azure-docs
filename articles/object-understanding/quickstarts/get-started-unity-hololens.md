# Quickstart: Create a HoloLens app with Azure Object Understanding, in Unity

In this quickstart, you'll create a Unity HoloLens app that uses [Azure Object Understanding](../overview.md). Azure
Object Understanding is a managed cloud service that converts 3D assets into AI models that enable object-aware mixed
reality experiences for the HoloLens. When you're finished, you'll have a HoloLens app built with Unity that can detect
objects in the physical world.

You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Prepare Unity build settings.
> * Export the HoloLens Visual Studio project.
> * Deploy the app and run it on a HoloLens 2 device.

[!INCLUDE [Unity quickstart prerequisites](../../../includes/object-understanding-quickstart-unity-prerequisites.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Unity device setup](../../../includes/object-understanding-quickstart-unity-device-setup.md)]

## Open the sample project

[!INCLUDE [Clone Sample Repo](../../../includes/object-understanding-clone-sample-repository.md)]

In Unity, open the `quickstarts/apps/unity/ou-basic` project.

[!INCLUDE [Unity build and run](../../../includes/object-understanding-quickstart-unity-build-run.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Unity build sample scene](../../../includes/object-understanding-quickstart-unity-build-sample-scene.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Unity build and deploy](../../../includes/object-understanding-quickstart-unity-build-deploy.md)]

### Run the sample app

Turn on the device, click **All Apps**, and open the app. After the Unity splash screen, you'll see a message indicating that the Object Watcher has been initialized. However, you'll need to add your model to the app.

[!INCLUDE [Unity setup Windows Device Portal](../../../includes/object-understanding-quickstart-unity-setup-device-portal.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Unity upload your model](../../../includes/object-understanding-quickstart-unity-upload-model.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Unity troubleshooting](../../../includes/object-understanding-quickstart-unity-troubleshooting.md)]

### Capturing diagnostics

If you're still not able to find the issue, you can capture diagnostics and send it to us.

Similar to uploading a model, upload an empty file named `debug` to the `LocalState` folder.

Restart the app to begin recording diagnostics. Try to detect your object again. Then, close the app to stop the recording.

The diagnostics `.zip` file will be located in the `TempState` folder named using a timestamp.

In Windows Device Portal, navigate to your application's `TempState` folder and download the `.zip` file. Send the `.zip` file to us.
