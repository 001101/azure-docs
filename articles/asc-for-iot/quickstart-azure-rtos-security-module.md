# Quickstart: Onboard Azure Security Center for IoT Azure RTOS IoT security module 

This article provides an explanation of the prerequisites before getting started and explains how to enable the Azure IoT security module for Azure RTOS service on an IoT Hub. If you don't currently have an IoT Hub, see [Create an IoT Hub using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) to get started.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure IoT Security Module currently only supports standard tier IoT Hubs.

## Prerequisites 

To enable the service:

- Install the following tools:
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.13 or later

- Make sure the following packages and configurations are setup correctly:
  - Azure RTOS â€“ Azure IoT Middleware.
  - **NX_AZURE_DISABLE_IOT_SECURITY_MODULE** Compile flag is OFF.
  
### IoT Hub connection

If you don't already have IoT security enabled on your IoT Hub, enable security on your IoT Hub to get started:

1. Open your **IoT Hub** in Azure portal.
1. Under the **Security** menu, click **Secure your IoT solution**.

The Azure IoT Security Module uses Azure IoT Middleware connections based on the **MQT** protocol.
Connections credentials are taken from the user application configuration **HOST_NAM**, **DEVICE_ID**,and **DEVICE_SYMMETRIC_KEY**.

| ASC_COLLECTOR_NETWORK_ACTIVITY_MAX_IPV6_OBJECTS_IN_CACHE | Number | 64  | Maximum number of IPv6 network events to store in memory |


## Compile flags
Compile flags allows you to override predefined configurations.

### Collectors
| Name | Type | Default | Details |
| - | - | - | - |
| collector_heartbeat_enabled | Boolean | ON | Enable the heartbeat collector |
| collector_network_activity_enabled | Boolean | ON | Enable the network activity collector |
| collector_system_information_enabled | Boolean | ON | Enable the system information collector |

- Log Analytics workspace
  - Two types of information are stored by default in your Log Analytics workspace by Azure Security Center for IoT; **security alerts** and **recommendations**.
  - You can choose to add storage of an additional information type, **raw events**. Note that storing **raw events** in Log Analytics carries additional storage costs.
- IoT Hub (standard tier)
- Meet all [service prerequisites](service-prerequisites.md)

### Geolocation and IP address handling

To secure your IoT solution, IP addresses of incoming and outgoing connections to and from your IoT devices, IoT Edge, and IoT Hub(s) are collected and stored by default. This information is essential to detect abnormal connectivity from suspicious IP sources. For example, when attempts are made to establish connections from an IP source of a known botnet or from an IP source outside your geolocation. Azure Security Center for IoT service offers the flexibility to enable and disable collection of IP address data at any time.

To enable or disable collection of IP address data:

1. Open your IoT Hub and then select **Overview** from the **Security** menu.
1. Choose the **Settings** screen and modify the geolocation and/or IP handling settings as you wish.

### Log Analytics creation

When Azure Security Center for IoT is turned on, a default Azure Log Analytics workspace is created to store raw security events, alerts, and recommendations for your IoT devices, IoT Edge, and IoT Hub. Each month, the first five (5) GB of data ingested per customer to the Azure Log Analytics service  is free. Every GB of data ingested into your Azure Log Analytics workspace is retained at no charge for the first 31 days. Learn more about [Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) pricing.

To change the workspace configuration of Log Analytics:

1. Open your IoT Hub and then select **Overview** from the **Security** menu.
1. Choose the **Settings** screen and modify the workspace configuration of Log Analytics settings as you wish.

### Customize your IoT security solution

By default, turning on the Azure Security Center for IoT solution automatically secures all IoT Hubs under your Azure subscription.

To turn Azure Security Center for IoT service on a specific IoT Hub on or off:

1. Open your IoT Hub and then select **Overview** from the **Security** menu.
1. Choose the **Settings** screen and modify the security settings of any IoT hub in your Azure subscription as you wish.
