# Edge security module

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ASC for IoT is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloÂ§1ads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

[Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/) provides powerful capabilities to manange and perform business workflows at the edge.
The key part that it plays in IoT environments coupled with the relateive abundance of resources compared to other IoT devices, make it particularly attractive for mailcious intenders.

ASC for IoT security module provides a comprehensive security solution for your IoT Edge device.
Security module collects, aggregates and analyzes raw security data from your Operating System and Container system into actionable security recommendations and alerts.

Similarly to ASC for IoT security agents for IoT devices, security Edge module is highly customizable through it's module twin.
For more details, see [Configure your agent](how-to-agent-configuration.md).

ASC for IoT security module for IoT Edge support the following features:

- Collect raw security events from

  - The underlying Operating System (Linux)
  - The Edge Container systems
  
  To learn more about available security data collectors, see [ASC for IoT agent configuration](how-to-agent-configuration.md).

- Analyze Edge deployment manifest

- Aggregate raw security events into messages sent through [Edge hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/iot-edge-runtime#iot-edge-hub).

- Configure remotely through use of the security module twin. To learn more, see [Configure an ASC for IoT agent](how-to-agent-configuration.md).

ASC for IoT security module for IoT Edge runs as privelged module under IoT Edge.
Privilege mode is required to allow the module to monitor the Operating System, and other Edge modules.

## Agent supported platforms

ASC for IoT security module for IoT Edge is currently available only for Linux.
