# Azure IoT Security Module - RTOS security alerts and recommendations (preview)

Azure IoT Security Module - RTOS continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to potential malicious activity and suspicious system modifications.

In addition, you can create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected device behavior and baselines.
An alert acts as an indicator of potential compromise, and should be investigated and remediated. A recommendation identifies weak security posture and should also be remediated and updated. 

In this article, you'll find a list of built-in alerts and recommendations which can be triggered as well as those that you can customize with your own values based on expected or baseline behavior. 

For more details on how alert customization works in the Azure Security Center for IoT service, see [customizable alerts](concept-customizable-security-alerts.md). The specific alerts and recommendations available for customization when using the Azure IoT Security Module - RTOS are detailed in the following tables.
