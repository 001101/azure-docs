## What are Azure Marketplace and AppSource?

Microsoft provides two distinct Marketplace storefronts that allow partners to list offers, enable trials, and transact directly with Microsoft’s customers and ecosystem: [Azure Marketplace] (https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) and [AppSource] (https://appsource.microsoft.com). These storefronts allow customers to find, try, and buy applications and services that accelerate their Digital Transformation, and help publishers grow their businesses by increasing access to Microsoft’s customers and partner ecosystem.
 
The Marketplace storefronts are aligned to audiences and Microsoft cloud products to help customers find exactly what they need. Each storefront offers specialized publishing options, to help you maximize your publishing investment summarized by the following table:

## Understanding the Differences Between Storefronts

Choosing a storefront starts with identifying the target audience for your offer: Azure Marketplace is aligned to the needs of IT Professionals and Developers, and AppSource is aligned to Business Users. If your solution targets both audiences, you only need to publish once to list in both storefronts.
 
Consider the additional benefits of each storefront:

|Storefront Benefit  |Azure Marketplace  |AppSource   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Billing Flexibility**    | For Virtual Machines, “Pay as you go” billing options, use Microsoft enterprise agreements or web direct sales models. Pricing options also include a Free Tier subscription where an offering is perpetually free, as well as a Try It Now subscription that is promotionally free for a limited period after which it converts to a paid subscription. “Bring Your Own License” activation is also an option for supporting publishers For both billing options, in scenarios where Virtual Machines are deployed using Azure Apps (e.g., Solution Template or Managed App), all Azure resources provisioned are billed directly to the customer | AppSource offers seamless provisioning of a trial experience but does not currently offer a commerce-enabled publishing option; this enables you to leverage your current ordering and billing infrastructure with no additional investment or changes        |
|**Facilitate Connections with Other Partners**     |Azure Marketplace does not currently allow the publisher to link a service provider or delivery partners to the offer         |  Independent Software Vendors, Systems Integrators, and Managed Services Providers can be linked for specific implementation scenarios, supporting collaborative selling to new customers      |
|**Automation**     |    Azure Marketplace does not currently allow the publisher to link a service provider or delivery partners to the offer     | Leverage automated SaaS with add-in provisioning and use Solution Templates to automate SaaS-based data collection and deployment scenarios        |Independent Software Vendors, Systems Integrators, and Managed Services Providers can be linked for specific implementation scenarios, supporting collaborative selling to new customers
|**Multiple Cloud Types**     |   Publish both public cloud and on-premises solutions through Azure Stack, or publish to Azure Government and regional clouds including China and Germany      |    AppSource does not currently offer support for Azure Stack, Azure Government, or regional clouds     |
|**In-Context Presentation to Customers**     |  Make your solution available in the Azure in-portal experience for contextual search (Virtual Machines and Solution Templates)       |  Make your solution available in the in-app experience for Microsoft products       |
