# Create recovery plans


This article provides information about creating and customizing recovery plans in [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md).

Post any comments or questions at the bottom of this article, or on the [Azure Recovery Services Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=hypervrecovmgr).

 Create recovery plans to do the following:

* Define groups of machines that fail over together, and then start up together.
* Model dependencies between machines, by grouping them together into a recovery plan group. For example, to fail over and bring up a specific application, you group all of the VMs for that application into the same recovery plan group.
* Run a failover. You can run a test, planned, or unplanned failover on a recovery plan.


## Create a recovery plan

1. Click **Recovery Plans** > **Create Recovery Plan**.
   Specify a name for the recovery plan, and a source and target. The source location must have virtual machines that are enabled for failover and recovery.

    - For VMM to VMM replication, select **Source Type** > **VMM**, and the source and target VMM servers. Click **Hyper-V** to see clouds that are protected.
    - For VMM to Azure, select **Source Type** > **VMM**.  Select the source VMM server, and **Azure** as the target.
    - For Hyper-V replication to Azure (without VMM), select **Source Type** > **Hyper-V site**. Select the site as the source, and **Azure** as the target.
    - For a VMware VM or a physical on-premises server to Azure, select a configuration server as the source, and **Azure** as the target.
    - For a Azure to Azure recovery plan, select a Azure region as the source, and a secondary Azure region as the target. The secondary Azure regions are only those to which virtual machines are protected.
2. In **Select virtual machines**, select the virtual machines (or replication group) that you want to add to the default group (Group 1) in the recovery plan.

## Customize and extend recovery plans

You can customize and extend recovery plans:

- **Add new groups**—Add additional recovery plan groups (up to seven) to the default group, and then add more machines or replication groups to those recovery plan groups. Groups are numbered in the order in which you add them. A virtual machine, or replication group, can only be included in one recovery plan group.
- **Add a manual action**—You can add manual actions that run before or after a recovery plan group. When the recovery plan runs, it stops at the point at which you inserted the manual action. A dialog box prompts you to specify that the manual action was completed.
- **Add a script**—You can add scripts that run before or after a recovery plan group. When you add a script, it adds a new set of actions for the group. For example, a set of pre-steps for Group 1 will be created with the name: Group 1: pre-steps. All pre-steps will be listed inside this set. You can only add a script on the primary site if you have a VMM server deployed. [Learn more](site-recovery-how-to-add-vmmscript.md).
- **Add Azure runbooks**—You can extend recovery plans with Azure runbooks. For example, to automate tasks, or to create single-step recovery. [Learn more](site-recovery-runbook-automation.md).


## Add a script, runbook or manual action to a plan

You can add a script or manual action to the default recovery plan group after you've added VMs or replication groups to it, and created the plan.

1. Open the recovery plan.
2. Click an item in the **Step** list, and then click **Script** or **Manual Action**.
3. Specify whether to want to add the script or action before or after the selected item. Use the **Move Up** and **Move Down**  buttons, to move the position of the script up or down.
4. If you add a VMM script, select **Failover to VMM script**. In **Script Path**, type the relative path to the share. In the VMM example below, you specify the path: **\RPScripts\RPScript.PS1**.
5. If you add an Azure automation run book, specify the Azure Automation account in which the runbook is located, and select the appropriate Azure runbook script.
6. Do a failover of the recovery plan, to make sure the script works as expected.

The script or runbook options are available only in the below scenarios when doing a failover or failback. A manual action is available for both failover and failback.


|Scenario               |Failover |Failback |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|
|Azure to Azure         |Runbooks |Runbook  |
|Vmware to Azure        |Runbooks |NA       | 
|VMM to Azure           |Runbooks |Script   |
|Hyper-v site to Azure  |Runbooks |NA       |
|VMM to VMM             |Script   |Script   |
