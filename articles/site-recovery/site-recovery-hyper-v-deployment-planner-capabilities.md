# Azure Site Recovery Deployment planner capabilities

You can run the command-line tool (ASRDeploymentPlanner.exe) in any of the following four modes: 
1.	[Get VM list](site-recovery-hyper-v-deployment-planner-getvmlist.md).
2.	[Profiling](site-recovery-hyper-v-deployment-planner-profiling.md)
3.	[Report generation](site-recovery-hyper-v-deployment-planner-generate-report.md)
4.	[Get throughput](site-recovery-hyper-v-deployment-planner-get-throughput.md)

First, run the tool to get the list of VMs from a single or multiple Hyper-V hosts.  Then run the tool in profiling mode to gather VM data churn and IOPS. Next, run the tool to generate the report to find the network bandwidth and storage requirements.

## Next steps
[Get list of Hyper-V VMs](site-recovery-hyper-v-deployment-planner-getvmlist.md).
