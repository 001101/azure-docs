# Monitor Site Recovery with Azure Monitor Logs

This article describes how to monitor machines protected by Azure [Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) using [Azure Monitor logs](../azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-logs.md).

Azure Monitor Logs provide a log data platform that collects activity and diagnostic logs, along with other monitoring data. You use [Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview.md) to write and test log queries, and to interactively analyze log data. After analyzing log data, you can visualize and query log results, and configure alerts to take actions based on the query results.

For Site Recovery, you can Azure Monitor Logs to help you do the following:

- Monitor Site Recovery, including replication health and the health of protected items, test failover status, Site Recovery events, and disk metrics.
- Set up alerts based on monitoring results.


## Before you start

Before you set up Azure Monitor Logs with Site Recovery, you should have the following in place:

- At least one machine protected in a Recovery Services vault.
- A Log Analytics workspace that can store the Site Recovery logs. [Learn about](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace.md) setting up a workspace.
- A basic understanding of how to write, run, and analyze log queries in Log Analytics. [Learn more](../azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal.md).

We recommend that you review [common monitoring questions](monitoring-common-questions.md) before you start.

## Configure Site Recovery to send logs

1. In the vault, click **Diagnostic settings** > **Add diagnostic setting**.
2. In **Diagnostic settings**, specify a name for log action, and select **Send to Log Analytics**.
3. Select the Azure Monitor Logs subscription, and the Log Analytics workspace.
1. From the log list, select all the logs with the prefix **AzureSiteRecovery**. Then click **OK**.

The Site Recovery logs will start to feed into a table **AzureDiagnostics** in the selected workspace.

## Query the logs - samples

You retrieve data from logs using log queries written with the [Kusto query language](../azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-queries.md). Here are a few examples of common queries you might use for Site Recovery monitoring.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the examples use **replicationProviderName_s** set to **A2A**. This retrieves Azure VMs that are replicated to a secondary Azure region using Site Recovery. In these examples, you can replace **A2A** with **InMageAzureV2** if you want to retrieve on-premises VMware VMs or physical servers that are replicated to Azure using Site Recovery.


### Query replication health

This query plots a pie chart for current replication health of all protected Azure VMs, broken down into three states: Normal, Warning, or Critical.

```

### Query RPO

This query plots a bar chart of Azure VMs replicated with Site Recovery, broken down by recovery point objectives (RPO): Less than 15 minutes, between 15-30 minutes, more than 30 minutes.

```

| where isnotempty(name_s) and isnotnull(name_s)

rpoInSeconds_d <= 1800, "15-30Min",   
">30Min")  
| summarize hint.strategy=partitioned arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by name_s  
| project name_s , RPO  
| summarize Count = count() by RPO  
| render barchart 
```

### Query Site Recovery jobs

This query retrieves all Site Recovery jobs (for all disaster recovery scenarios), triggered in the last 72 hours, and their completion state.

```
AzureDiagnostics   
| where Category == "AzureSiteRecoveryEvents"   
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(72h)   
| project AffectedObject=affectedResourceName_s , VaultName = Resource, Description_s = healthErrors_s , Severity = Level  
```

### Query test failover health

This query plots a pie chart for the test failover health for Azure VMs replicated with Site Recovery.

```
AzureDiagnostics  
| where replicationProviderName_s == "A2A"   
| where isnotempty(name_s) and isnotnull(name_s)
