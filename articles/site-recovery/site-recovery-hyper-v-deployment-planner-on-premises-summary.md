# On-premises summary report
The On-premises summary worksheet provides an overview of the profiled Hyper-V environment

**Start Date** and **End Date**: The start and end dates of the profiling data considered for report generation. By default, the start date is the date when profiling starts, and the end date is the date when profiling stops. This can be the ‘StartDate’ and ‘EndDate’ values if the report is generated with these parameters.

**Total number of profiling days**: The total number of days of profiling between the start and end dates for which the report is generated.

**Number of compatible virtual machines**: The total number of compatible VMs for which the required network bandwidth, required number of storage accounts, Microsoft Azure cores are calculated.

**Total number of disks across all compatible virtual machines**: The total number of disks across all compatible VMs.

**Average number of disks per compatible virtual machine**: The average number of disks calculated across all compatible VMs.

**Average disk size (GB)**: The average disk size calculated across all compatible VMs.

**Desired RPO (minutes)**: Either the default recovery point objective or the value passed for the ‘DesiredRPO’ parameter at the time of report generation to estimate required bandwidth.

**Desired bandwidth (Mbps)**: The value that you have passed for the ‘Bandwidth’ parameter at the time of report generation to estimate achievable RPO.

**Observed typical data churn per day (GB)**: The average data churn observed across all profiling days.
