### 1.1
Updated: March 9, 2017

Fixed the following issues:

* The tool cannot profile VMs if the vCenter has two or more VMs with the same name or IP address across various ESXi hosts.
* Copy and search are disabled for the Compatible VMs and Incompatible VMs worksheets.

### 1.0
Updated: February 23, 2017

Azure Site Recovery Deployment Planner public preview 1.0 has the following known issues (to be addressed in upcoming updates):

* The tool works only for VMware-to-Azure scenarios, not for Hyper-V-to-Azure deployments. For Hyper-V-to-Azure scenarios, use the [Hyper-V capacity planner tool](./site-recovery-capacity-planning-for-hyper-v-replication.md).
* The GetThroughput operation is not supported in the US Government and China Microsoft Azure regions.
* The tool cannot profile VMs if the vCenter server has two or more VMs with the same name or IP address across various ESXi hosts. In this version, the tool skips profiling for duplicate VM names or IP addresses in the VMListFile. The workaround is to profile the VMs by using an ESXi host instead of the vCenter server. You must run one instance for each ESXi host.
