# Azure security baseline for Site Recovery

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Site
Recovery. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Site
Recovery. **Controls** not applicable to Site
Recovery have been excluded. 

To see how Site
Recovery completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Site
Recovery security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33719.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage access to data and resources related to Site Recovery resources. 

Separate work duties with Azure RBAC and grant appropriate access required for them. Use the built-in Site Recovery roles to control Site Recovery management operations.

All the storage resources used by Site Recovery services metadata with configuration of type: Read Access Geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS). Storage accounts of type above GRS (Like RAGRS, RAG-ZRS) replicate your data to a secondary region (hundreds of miles away from the primary location of the source data) to continue to serve Disaster Recovery for customers during outages.

This is out of customer scope and Site Recovery team takes care of it internally. Customer can backup Key Vault keys in Azure.
