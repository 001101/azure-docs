# IoT Hub devices in Azure Digital Twins

In addition to your digital twins based on business concepts with [twin type models](concepts-models.md), you can also have digital twins in the twin graph that represent IoT devices placed in your environment. IoT devices might be simple sensors, such as thermostats, or more complex machines. These devices are typically managed in an [Azure IoT hub](../iot-hub/about-iot-hub.md).

Azure Digital Twins makes it easy to work with devices by allowing you to integrate an IoT hub into your Azure Digital Twins instance.

Once you attach a hub to Azure Digital Twins, each device connected to the hub can become visible as a node in the twin graph. These nodes are known as **proxy twins**.

As with digital twins based on twin type models, proxy twins can be connected with relationships to any other Azure digital twin in the twin graph to build the topology. It is typical for proxy twins to drive the live twin graph, as incoming data from devices triggers event handling functions that drive properties on other digital twins.

## Working with real devices in preview

Azure Digital Twins (preview) has a limited set of capabilities around proxy twins. You are able to:
* Create proxy twins representing IoT Hub devices
* Allow digital twins based on twin type models to form relationships with the proxy twins
* Query proxy twins in the twin graph

In preview, Azure Digital Twins is unable to receive information about device capabilities, including their properties, commands, or the messages they can send. The message payload is therefore unknown to the system. 

To manage proxy twins, you use the same APIs and practices used to [manage all Azure digital twins](how-to-manage-twin.md).
