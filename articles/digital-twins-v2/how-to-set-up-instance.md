# Set up an Azure Digital Twins instance

This article will walk you through the basic steps to set up a new Azure Digital Twins instance. This includes creating the instance, and assigning [Azure Active Directory (AAD)](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) permissions to the instance for yourself.

[!INCLUDE [Azure Digital Twins setup steps: instance creation and authentication](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-1.md)]

You now have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to go.
