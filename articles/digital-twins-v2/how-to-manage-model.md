# Manage your Azure Digital Twins model set

Azure Digital Twins (ADT) **Model Management APIs** are APIs used to manage the models (types of twins and relationships) that a given ADT instance knows about. Management operations include upload, validation, and retrieval of twin models authored in [Digital Twins Definition language (DTDL)](concepts-DTDL.md). 

## Modeling (Private Preview)

Consider an example in which a hospital wants to model their rooms, complete with sensors to monitor traffic into/out of the rooms and handwashing stations in each room.
The first step towards the solution is to model the twin types used to represent the hospital. Models for ADT are written in DTDL. A patient room might be described as:

```json
{
  "@id": "urn:example:PatientRoom:1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "displayName": "Patient Room",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "visitorCount",
      "schema": "double"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "handWashCount",
      "schema": "double"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "handWashPercentage",
      "schema": "double"
    },

    {
      "@type": "Relationship",
      "name": "hasDevices"
    }
  ],
  "@context": "http://azure.com/v3/contexts/Model.json"
}
```

This description defines a name and a unique ID for the patient room, a few properties to represent handwash status (counters that will be updated from motion sensors and soap dispensers, as well as a computed *handwash percentage* property). The type also defines a relationship *hasDevices* that will be used to connect to the actual devices.
In a similar manner, types for the hospital itself, as well as hospital wards or zones can be defined.

## Uploading Models

Once models are created, you can upload them to the service instance. 
An example:

```csharp
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("...");
// Read model file into string (not part of SDK)
StreamReader r = new StreamReader("MyModelFile.dtdl"));
string dtdl = r.ReadToEnd(); r.Close();
Task<Response> rUpload = client.UploadDTDLAsync(dtdl);
Clients can also upload multiple files in one single transaction:
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("connectionString");
var dtdlFiles = Directory.EnumerateFiles(sourceDirectory, "*.dtdl");

List<string> dtdlStrings = new List<string>();
foreach (string fileName in dtdlFiles)
{
    // Read model file into string (not part of SDK)
    StreamReader r = new StreamReader("MyModelFile.dtdl"));
    string dtdl = r.ReadToEnd(); r.Close();
    dtdlStrings.Add(dtdl); 
}

Task<Response> rUpload client.UploadDTDLAsync(dtdlStrings.ToArray());
```

The DTDL upload API provides two overloads for loading DTDL. One overload lets you pass a single string containing DTDL models, the other lets you pass an array of DTDL models. Each string can either contain a single DTDL model, or multiple models as a JSON array:

```csharp
[
  {
    "@id": "urn:Planet",
    "@type": "Interface",
    ...
  },
  {
    "@id": "urn:Moon",
    "@type": "Interface",
    ...
  }
]
```
 
On upload, model files are validated. 

## Retrieve Model(s)

You can list and retrieve models stored on your ADT service instance. Your options are:
* Retrieve all models
* Retrieve a single model
* Retrieve a single model with dependencies
* Retrieve metadata for models

An example:

```csharp
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("...");  
// Get just the names of available models
IAsyncEnumerable<Response<ModelData>> modelData = RetrieveAllModelsAsync(IncludeModels.None);
// Get the entire model schema
IAsyncEnumerable<Response<ModelData>> modelData =    
                                             client.RetrieveAllModelsAsync(IncludeModels.All);
// Get a single model
Response<ModelData> oneModel = client.RetrieveModel(modelId, IncludeModels.All);
// Get a single model with all referenced models, recursively
IAsyncEnumerable<Response<ModelData>> oneModelWithDependencies = 
                        client.RetrieveModelWithDependenciesAsync(modelId, IncludeModels.All);
```

The API calls to retrieve models return `ModelData` objects. `ModelData` contains metadata about the model stored in the ADT service instance, such as name, DTMI, and creation date of the model. The `ModelData` object also optionally includes the model itself. Depending on parameters, you can thus use the retrieve calls to either retrieve just metadata (which is useful in scenarios where you want to display a UI list of available tools, for example), or the entire model.

The `RetrieveModelWithDependencies` call returns not only the requested model, but also all models that the requested model depends on.
Models are not necessarily returned in exactly the document form they were uploaded in. ADT makes no guarantees about the form a document is returned in, beyond that the document will be returned in semantically equivalent form. 

## Parse Models

As part of the ADT SDK, a DTDL parsing library is provided as a client-side library. This library provides object-model access to the DTDL type definitions – effectively, the equivalent of C# reflection on DTDL. This library can be used independently of the ADT SDK; for example, for validation in a visual or text editor for DTDL. 

To use the parser library, you provide a set of DTDL documents to the library. Typically, you would retrieve these model documents from the service, but you might also have them available locally, if your client was responsible for uploading them to the service in the first place. The overall workflow is as follows.
* You retrieve all (or, potentially, some) DTDL documents from the service.
* You pass the returned in-memory DTDL documents to the parser.
* The parser will validate the set of documents passed to it and return detailed error information. This ability is useful in editor scenarios.
* You can use the parser APIs to analyze the types included in the document set. 

The functionalities of the parser are:
    - Get all interfaces implemented (the content of the extends section)
    - Get all properties, telemetry, commands, components, and relationships declared in the type. This command also gets all metadata included in these definitions and takes inheritance (`extends` sections) into account
    - Get all complex type definitions
    - Ascertain if a type is assignable from another type 

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Plug and Play (PnP) devices use a small syntax variant to describe their functionality. This syntax variant is a semantically compatible subset of DTDL as used in ADT. When using the parser library, you do not need to know which syntax variant was used to create the DTDL for your twin. The parser will always, by default, return the same object model for both PnP and Azure Digital Twins syntax.

### An example

The following models are defined in the service (the `dtmi:com:example:coffeeMaker` model is using the capability model syntax, which implies that it was installed in the service by connecting an [IoT Plug and Play (PnP)](../iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play.md) device exposing that model):

```csharp
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:example:coffeeMaker",
  "@type”: "CapabilityModel",
  "implements": [
	{ "name": "coffeeMaker", "schema": " dtmi:com:example:coffeeMakerInterface" }
  ]    
}
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:example:coffeeMakerInterface",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "contents": [
  	{ "@type": "Property", "name”: "waterTemp", "schema": "double" }  
  ]
}
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:example:coffeeBar",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "contents": [
	{ "@type": "relationship", "contains": " dtmi:com:example:coffeeMaker” },
	{ "@type": "property", "name": "capacity”, “schema”: integer }
  ]    
}
```

The following code shows an example on how to use the parser library to reflect on these definitions in C#:
```csharp
public void LogModel(DTInterface model)
{
    Log.WriteLine("Interface: "+model.id);
    Log.WriteLine("**** Properties:");
    foreach (DTProperty p in model.Properties)
    {
        Log.WriteLine("  name: "+p.Name);
    }
    Log.WriteLine("**** Telemetry:");
    foreach (DTTelemetry t in model.Telemetries)
    {
        Log.WriteLine("  name: "+t.Name);
    }
    Log.WriteLine("**** Relationships:");
    foreach (DTRelationship r in model.Relationships)
    {
        Log.WriteLine("  name: "+r.Name);
    }
    foreach (DTComponent c in model.Components)
    {
        Log.WriteLine("  name: "+c.Id);
        Log.WriteLine(c.type); 
    }
}

public void ParseModels()
{
    DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("..."); 
    // Get the entire model schema
    IEnumerable<Response<ModelData>> modelResp = client.RetrieveAllModels();
    IEnumerable<JsonDocument> models = Client.ExtractModels(modelResp);

    ModelParser parser = new ModelParser(); 
    IReadOnlyDictionary<Dtmi, DTEntityInfo> modelDict = Parse(models);

    DTInterface ires = modelDict[coffeeMakerDTMI] as DTInterface;
    if (ires!=null)
    {
        // Prints out coffeeMaker with the implements
        // section from the CM expressed as components 
        LogModel(ires); 
    }
    DTInterface ires = modelDict[coffeeBarDTMI] as DTInterface;
    if (ires!=null)
    {
        // Prints out CoffeeBar with property and relationship
        LogModel(ires); 
    }
}
```
## Model Deletion

Models can also be deleted from the service. Deletion is a multi-step process:
* First, **decommission** the model. A decommissioned model is still valid for use by existing twin instances, including the ability to change properties or add and delete relationships. However, new instances of this model type can't be created anymore.
* After decommissioning a model, you will typically either delete existing instances of that model, or transition the twin instance to a different model.
* Once there are no more instances of a given model, and the model is not referenced by any other model any longer, you can **delete** it. 

```csharp
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("...");  
client.DecommisionModel(dtmiOfPlanetInterface);
// Write some code that deletes or transitions twins
...
```

`DecommissionModel()` can take one or more than one URN(s), so developers can process one or multiple ones in one statement. The decommissioning status is also included in the `ModelData` records returned by the model retrieval APIs.
