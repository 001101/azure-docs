# Manage Azure Digital Twins models

You can manage the [models](concepts-models.md) that your Azure Digital Twins instance knows about using the [**DigitalTwinsModels APIs**](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md). Management operations include upload, validation, retrieval, and deletion of models. 

The samples in this article use the C# SDK.

## Create models

Consider an example in which a hospital wants to digitally represent their rooms. Each room contains a smart soap dispenser for monitoring hand-washing, and sensors to monitor traffic through the room.

The first step towards the solution is to create models to represent aspects of the hospital. 

Models for Azure Digital Twins are written in DTDL. A patient room in this scenario might be described like this:

```json
{
  "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:PatientRoom;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
  "displayName": "Patient Room",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "visitorCount",
      "schema": "double"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "handWashCount",
      "schema": "double"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "handWashPercentage",
      "schema": "double"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Relationship",
      "name": "hasDevices"
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is a sample body for a .json file in which a model is defined and saved, to be uploaded as part of a client project. If you are defining a model in the body of an API call, remember to fit the code above into the context of a complete API call body (including *[]* brackets around this section).

This model defines a name and a unique ID for the patient room, and properties to represent visitor count and hand-wash status (these counters will be updated from motion sensors and smart soap dispensers, and will be used together to calculate a *handwash percentage* property). The model also defines a relationship *hasDevices*, which will be used to connect any [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) based on this *Room* model to the actual devices.

Following this method, you can go on to define models for the hospital's wards, zones, or the hospital itself.

## Upload models

Once models are created, you can upload them to the Azure Digital Twins instance.

Here is a code sample showing how to do this:

```csharp
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("...");
// Read model file into string (not part of SDK)
StreamReader r = new StreamReader("MyModelFile.json"));
string dtdl = r.ReAzure Digital TwinsoEnd(); r.Close();
Task<Response> rUpload = client.UploadDTDLAsync(dtdl);
Clients can also upload multiple files in one single transaction:
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("connectionString");
var dtdlFiles = Directory.EnumerateFiles(sourceDirectory, "*.json");

List<string> dtdlStrings = new List<string>();
foreach (string fileName in dtdlFiles)
{
    // Read model file into string (not part of SDK)
    StreamReader r = new StreamReader("MyModelFile.json"));
    string dtdl = r.ReAzure Digital TwinsoEnd(); r.Close();
    dtdlStrings.Add(dtdl); 
}

Task<Response> rUpload client.UploadDTDLAsync(dtdlStrings.ToArray());
```

> [!TIP]
> All SDK functions come in synchronous and asynchronous versions.

The DTDL upload API provides two overloads for loading DTDL. One overload lets you pass a single string containing DTDL models; the other lets you pass an array of DTDL models. Each string can either contain a single DTDL model, or multiple models as a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Planet",
    "@type": "Interface",
    //...
  },
  {
    "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Moon",
    "@type": "Interface",
    //...
  }
]
```
 
On upload, model files are validated.

## Retrieve models

You can list and retrieve models stored on your Azure Digital Twins instance. 

Here are your options for this:
* Retrieve all models
* Retrieve a single model
* Retrieve a single model with dependencies
* Retrieve metadata for models

Here are some example calls:

```csharp
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("...");

// Get just the names of available models
IAsyncEnumerable<Response<ModelData>> modelData = RetrieveAllModelsAsync(IncludeModels.None);

// Get the entire model schema
IAsyncEnumerable<Response<ModelData>> modelData = client.RetrieveAllModelsAsync(IncludeModels.All);

// Get a single model
Response<ModelData> oneModel = client.RetrieveModel(modelId, IncludeModels.All);

// Get a single model with all referenced models, recursively
IAsyncEnumerable<Response<ModelData>> oneModelWithDependencies = client.RetrieveModelWithDependenciesAsync(modelId, IncludeModels.All);
```

The API calls to retrieve models all return `ModelData` objects. `ModelData` contains metadata about the model stored in the Azure Digital Twins instance, such as name, DTMI, and creation date of the model. The `ModelData` object also optionally includes the model itself. Depending on parameters, you can thus use the retrieve calls to either retrieve just metadata (which is useful in scenarios where you want to display a UI list of available tools, for example), or the entire model.

The `RetrieveModelWithDependencies` call returns not only the requested model, but also all models that the requested model depends on.

Models are not necessarily returned in exactly the document form they were uploaded in. Azure Digital Twins only guarantees that the return form will be semantically equivalent. 

## Parse models

As part of the Azure Digital Twins SDK, a DTDL parsing library is provided as a client-side library. This library provides model access to the DTDL definitionsâ€”effectively, the equivalent of C# reflection on DTDL. This library can be used independently of the Azure Digital Twins SDK; for example, for validation in a visual or text editor for DTDL. 

To use the parser library, you provide a set of DTDL documents to the library. Typically, you would retrieve these model documents from the service, but you might also have them available locally, if your client was responsible for uploading them to the service in the first place. 

The overall workflow is as follows.
1. You retrieve all (or, potentially, some) DTDL documents from the service.
2. You pass the returned in-memory DTDL documents to the parser.
3. The parser will validate the set of documents passed to it, and return detailed error information. This ability is useful in editor scenarios.
4. You can use the parser APIs to analyze the models included in the document set. 

The functionalities of the parser are:
* Get all implemented model interfaces (the contents of the interface's `extends` section).
* Get all properties, telemetry, commands, components, and relationships declared in the model. This command also gets all metadata included in these definitions and takes inheritance (`extends` sections) into account.
* Get all complex model definitions.
* Determine whether a model is assignable from another model.

> [!NOTE]
> [IoT Plug and Play (PnP)](../iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play.md) devices use a small syntax variant to describe their functionality. This syntax variant is a semantically compatible subset of the DTDL that is used in Azure Digital Twins. When using the parser library, you do not need to know which syntax variant was used to create the DTDL for your digital twin. The parser will always, by default, return the same model for both PnP and Azure Digital Twins syntax.

### Use the validator tool

There is a tool available for validating model documents to make sure the DTDL is valid. It is built on the DTDL parser library, and is available here: [DTDL Validator tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-digital-twins/tree/private-preview/DTDL/DTDLValidator-Sample).

### Use the parser library in code

You can also use the parser library directly to validate models yourself.

To support the parser code example below, consider several models defined in an Azure Digital Twins instance:

> [!TIP] 
> The `dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMaker` model is using the *capability model* syntax, which implies that it was installed in the service by connecting a PnP device exposing that model.

```json
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMaker",
  "@type": "CapabilityModel",
  "implements": [
        { "name": "coffeeMaker", "schema": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMakerInterface" }
  ]    
}
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMakerInterface",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "contents": [
      { "@type": "Property", "name": "waterTemp", "schema": "double" }  
  ]
}
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeBar",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "contents": [
        { "@type": "relationship", "contains": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMaker" },
        { "@type": "property", "name": "capacity", "schema": "integer" }
  ]    
}
```

The following code shows an example of how to use the parser library to reflect on these definitions in C#:

```csharp
public void LogModel(DTInterface model)
{
    Log.WriteLine("Interface: "+model.id);
    Log.WriteLine("**** Properties:");
    foreach (DTProperty p in model.Properties)
    {
        Log.WriteLine("  name: "+p.Name);
    }
    Log.WriteLine("**** Telemetry:");
    foreach (DTTelemetry t in model.Telemetries)
    {
        Log.WriteLine("  name: "+t.Name);
    }
    Log.WriteLine("**** Relationships:");
    foreach (DTRelationship r in model.Relationships)
    {
        Log.WriteLine("  name: "+r.Name);
    }
    foreach (DTComponent c in model.Components)
    {
        Log.WriteLine("  name: "+c.Id);
        Log.WriteLine(c.type); 
    }
}

public void ParseModels()
{
    DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("..."); 
    // Get the entire model schema
    IEnumerable<Response<ModelData>> modelResp = client.RetrieveAllModels();
    IEnumerable<JsonDocument> models = Client.ExtractModels(modelResp);

    ModelParser parser = new ModelParser(); 
    IReadOnlyDictionary<Dtmi, DTEntityInfo> modelDict = Parse(models);

    DTInterface ires = modelDict[coffeeMakerDTMI] as DTInterface;
    if (ires!=null)
    {
        // Prints out coffeeMaker with the implements
        // section from the CM expressed as components 
        LogModel(ires); 
    }
    DTInterface ires = modelDict[coffeeBarDTMI] as DTInterface;
    if (ires!=null)
    {
        // Prints out CoffeeBar with property and relationship
        LogModel(ires); 
    }
}
```

## Remove models

Models can also be removed from the service, in one of two ways:
* **Decommissioning** : Once a model is decommissioned, you can no longer use it to create new digital twins. Existing digital twins that already use this model aren't affected, so you can still update them with things like property changes and adding or deleting relationships.
* **Deletion** : This will completely remove the model from the solution. Any twins that were using this model are no longer associated with any valid model, so they're treated as though they don't have a model at all. You can still read these twins, but won't be able to make any updates on them.

These are separate features and they do not impact each other, although they may be used together to remove a model gradually. 

### Decommissioning

Here is the code to decommission a model:

```csharp
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient("...");  
client.DecommissionModel(dtmiOfPlanetInterface);
// Write some code that deletes or transitions digital twins
//...
```

`DecommissionModel()` can take one or more URNs, so developers can process one or multiple models in one statement. 

A model's decommissioning status is also included in the `ModelData` records returned by the model retrieval APIs.

### Deletion

#### Before deletion: Deletion requirements

Generally, models can be deleted at any time.

The exception is models that other models depend on, either with an `extends` relationship or as a component. For example, if a *ConferenceRoom* model extends a *Room* model, and has a *ACUnit* model as a component, you cannot delete *Room* or *ACUnit* until *ConferenceRoom* removes those respective references. 

You can do this by updating the dependent model to remove the dependencies, or deleting the dependent model completely.

#### During deletion: Deletion process

Even if a model meets the requirements to delete it immediately, you may want to go through a few steps first to avoid unintended consequences for the twins left behind. Here are some steps that can help you manage the process:
1. First, decommission the model
2. Wait a few minutes, to make sure the service has processed any last-minute twin creation requests sent before the decommission
3. Query twins by model to see all twins that are using the now-decommissioned model
4. Delete the twins if you no longer need them, or patch them to a new model if needed. You can also choose to leave them alone, in which case they will become twins without models once the model is deleted. See the next section for the implications of this state.
5. Wait for another few minutes to make sure the changes have percolated through
6. Delete the model 

#### After deletion: Twins without models

Once a model is deleted, any digital twins that were using the model are now considered to be without a model. Note that there is no query that can give you a list of all the twins in this stateâ€”although you *can* still query the twins by the deleted model to know what twins are affected.

Here is an overview of what you can and cannot do with twins that don't have a model.

Things you **can** do:
* Query the twin
* Read properties
* Read outgoing relationships
* Add and delete incoming relationships (as in, other twins can still form relationships *to* this twin)
  - The `target` in the relationship definition can still reflect the DTMI of the deleted model. A relationship with no defined target can also work here.
* Delete relationships
* Delete the twin

Things you **can't** do:
* Edit outgoing relationships (as in, relationships *from* this twin to other twins)
* Edit properties

#### After deletion: Re-uploading a model

After a model has been deleted, you may decide later to upload a new model with the same ID as the one you deleted. Here's what happens in that case.
* From the solution store's perspective, this is the same as uploading a completely new model. The service doesn't remember the old one was ever uploaded.   
* If there are any remaining twins in the graph referencing the deleted model, they are no longer orphaned; this model ID is valid again with the new definition. However, if the new definition for the model is different than the model definition that was deleted, these twins may have properties and relationships that match the deleted definition and are not valid with the new one.

Azure Digital Twins does not prevent this state, so be careful to patch twins appropriately in order to make sure they remain valid through the model definition switch.
