# Query the digital twin graph

The Query APIs let developers find sets of twins in the graph across relationships and applying filters.

Some example queries:

Get twins by properties
```sql
SELECT  * 
FROM DigitalTwins T  
WHERE T.$dtid in [‘123’, ‘456’]
AND T.firmwareVersion = ‘1.1’”
Get twins by model
SELECT  * 
FROM DigitalTwins T  
WHERE T.IS_OF_MODEL(T , ‘urn:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Space:3’)
AND T.roomSize > 50
```

Get twins by traversing relationships
```sql
SELECT *
FROM DigitalTwins space
JOIN device RELATED space.has  
WHERE space.$dtid = ‘Room 123’
AND device.$metadata.model = ‘urn:contosocom:DigitalTwins:MxChip:3’
AND has.role = ‘Operator’”
The following example shows how to execute queries:
var client = DigitalTwinsServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(“...”);
string results;
IAsynEnumerable<Result<JsonDocument>> result = client.Query(“querystring”);
```

This returns the query results in form of a JSON string. 
To parse the JSON results returned, use the JSON parser of your choice.
