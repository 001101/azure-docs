# Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs

The Azure Digital Twins REST APIs are used to manage the major elements of your Azure Digital Twins solution. The API surface can be broadly divided into the following categories: 

* **DigitalTwinsModels** - The DigitalTwinsModels category contains APIs to manage the [models](concepts-models.md) in an Azure Digital Twins instance. Management activities include upload, validation, and retrieval of models authored in DTDL.
* **DigitalTwins** - The DigitalTwins category contains the APIs that let developers create, modify, and delete [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) and their relationships in an Azure Digital Twins instance.
* **Query** - The Query category lets developers [find sets of digital twins in the twin graph](how-to-query-graph.md) across relationships.
* **EventRoutes** - The EventRoutes category contains APIs to [route data](concepts-route-events.md), through the system and to downstream services.

You can either use the REST APIs directly, or through an SDK. Currently, the only published SDK for interacting with these APIs is in C#. If you are working in another language, you can [generate your own SDK using AutoRest](how-to-create-custom-sdks.md).

## REST API usage examples

Use the [Azure Digital Twins OpenAPI (Swagger) file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-digital-twins/blob/private-preview/OpenApiSpec/digitaltwins.json) as a resource for calling the APIs directly.

You can also view example call bodies in the Swagger's accompanying [examples folder](https://github.com/Azure/azure-digital-twins/tree/private-preview/OpenApiSpec/examples).

## Azure Digital Twins C# SDK

The Azure Digital Twins C# SDK is part of the [Azure SDK for .NET](http://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-net).

See the general [design principles for Azure SDKs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html) and the specific [.NET design guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html) for in-depth information on SDK design.

To use the SDK, include the NuGet package **Azure.IoT.DigitalTwins** with your project. You will also need the **Azure.Identity** package.

* In Visual Studio, you can add packages with the NuGet Package Manager (Tools>NuGet Package Manager>Manage NuGet Packages for Solution). 
* Using the .NET command-line tool, you can run:
```bash
dotnet add package Azure.IoT.DigitalTwins
dotnet add package Azure.identity
```

For a detailed walk-through of using the APIs in practice, see the [Tutorial: Code a client app](tutorial-code.md). 

Here a few code samples:

Authenticate against the service:
```csharp
// Authenticate against the service and create a client
var credentials = new InteractiveBrowserCredential(tenantId, clientId);
DigitalTwinsClient client = new DigitalTwinsClient(new Uri(adtInstanceUrl), credentials);
```

Upload a model and list models:
```csharp
// Upload a model
var typeList = new List<string>();
string dtdl = File.ReadAllText("Simple.json");
typeList.Add(dtdl);
try {
    await client.CreateModelsAsync(typeList);
} catch (RequestFailedException rex) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Load model: {rex.Status}:{rex.Message}");
}
// Read a list of models back from the service
AsyncPageable<ModelData> modelDataList = client.GetModelsAsync();
await foreach (ModelData md in modelDataList)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Type name: {md.DisplayName}: {md.Id}");
}
```

Create and query twins:
```csharp
// Initialize twin metadata
var meta = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "$model", "urn:example:Simple:1" },
};
// Initialize the twin properties
var initData = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "$metadata", meta },
    { "data", "Hello World!" }
};
try {
    await client.CreateDigitalTwinAsync($"firstTwin", JsonSerializer.Serialize(initData));
} catch(RequestFailedException rex) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Create twin error: {rex.Status}:{rex.Message}");  
}

// Run a query    
AsyncPageable<string> result = client.QueryAsync("Select * From DigitalTwins");
await foreach (string twin in result)
{
    object jsonObj = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<object>(twin);
    string prettyTwin = JsonSerializer.Serialize(jsonObj, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true });
    Console.WriteLine(prettyTwin);
}
```

See the [Tutorial: Code a client app](tutorial-code.md) for a walkthrough of this sample app code. 

### General API usage

* To use the SDK, instantiate the **DigitalTwinsClient** class. The constructor requires credentials that can be obtained with a variety of authentication methods in the [Azure.Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity?view=azure-dotnet) package. 
* You may find the [InteractiveBrowserCredential](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.interactivebrowsercredential?view=azure-dotnet) useful while getting started, but there are several other options, including credentials for [managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.interactivebrowsercredential?view=azure-dotnet), which you will likely use to authenticate [Azure Functions set up with MSI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity?tabs=dotnet) against Azure Digital Twins.
* All service API calls are exposed as member functions on the DigitalTwinsClient class.
* All service functions exist in synchronous and asynchronous versions
* All service functions throw an exception for any return status >= 400. Make sure you wrap calls into a try section appropriately and catch at least [**RequestFailedExceptions**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.requestfailedexception?view=azure-dotnet).
* Most service methods return **Response<T>** or (**Task<Response<T>>** for the asynchronous calls), where `T` is the class of return object for the service call. The [**Response**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.response-1?view=azure-dotnet) class encapsulates the service return and presents return values in its Value field.  
* Service methods with paged results return [**Pageable<T>**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.pageable-1?view=azure-dotnet-preview) or [**AsyncPageable<T>**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.asyncpageable-1?view=azure-dotnet-preview) as results.
* You can iterate over paged results using an [**await foreach** loop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2019/november/csharp-iterating-with-async-enumerables-in-csharp-8).
* See [Azure.Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure?view=azure-dotnet-preview) for reference on the underlying SDK infrastructure and types.

Service methods return strongly-typed objects wherever possible. However, because Azure Digital Twins mostly is based on models custom-configured by the user at run time (via DTDL files uploaded to the service), many service APIs take and return JSON.

## Monitor API metrics

API metrics such as requests, latency, and failure rate can be viewed in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

From the portal homepage, search for your Azure Digital Twins instance to pull up its details. Select the **Metrics** option from the Azure Digital Twins instance's menu to bring up the *Metrics* page.

From here, you can view the metrics for your instance and create custom views.
