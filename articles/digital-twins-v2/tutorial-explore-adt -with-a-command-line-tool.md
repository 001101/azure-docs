# Explore ADT with a command line tool

In this tutorial, you will use a command line tool, supplied in source code, to explore an Azure Digital Twins instance. You will also explore the basic coding patterns used in the tool.

In this tutorial, you will...
* Set up an Azure Digital Twins instance
* Explore Azure Digital Twins using a command line tool
* Explore the code behind the command line tool and extend it

The tutorial is driven by a sample project written in C#. Get the sample project on your machine by [downloading the Azure Digital Twins samples repository as a ZIP file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/archive/master.zip).

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Azure Digital Twins setup steps: instance creation and authentication](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-1.md)]

#### Register your application

[!INCLUDE [Azure Digital Twins setup steps: client app registration](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-2.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Azure Digital Twins setup steps: client app configuration](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-3.md)]

## Prerequisites
* Visual Studio 2019

## Get started with the command line tool

In your cloned sample repo, navigate to the folder digital-twins-samples/buildingScenario/AdtSampleApp.

Open the solution file **AdtE2ESample.sln** with Visual Studio 2019

Configure the sample application to work with the instance of Azure DIgital Twins that you have previously set up. To do so:

* Copy the file serviceConfig.json.TEMPLATE to a new file called serviceConfig.json.
* Edit the newly created file. It contains a preset JSON file with 3 configuration variables:

```json
{
  "tenantId": "<your tenant id here>",
  "clientId": "<your client id here>",
  "instanceUrl": "<your instance URL here>"
}
```

Replace all three values with the values for your subscription, app registration and Azure DIgital Twins service instance.

Run the console application by pressing **F5** in Visual Studio.

When the application starts up, your default web browser will open and bring up a login prompt. Use this prompt to login to Azure.
You can then close the browser tab or window.

The command line sample tool will show up as follows:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-explore-adt-with-a-command-line-tool/CLITool-01.png" alt-text="Welcome message from the command line tool":::

Type help in the command line and press return. You will see a list of all supported commands:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-explore-adt-with-a-command-line-tool/CLITool-02.png" alt-text="Help message from the command line tool":::


## Use the command line tool to explore Azure DIgital Twins

Let's try a few commands. 

### Load Models
Before you can work with twins in Azure Digital Twins, you must configure your service instance with DTDL models that define your custom domain vocabulary. Let us load an example model.

In the command line type:
```bash
CreateModels Simple.json
```

Press return.

This command will upload one or more models to the service.

Note that the command names match the underlying SDK method names in the C# SDK. That should make it easy for you to find the relevant code in the source (all commands are in the file CommandLoop.cs).

Let's check if the model truly made it to the service.

Type:
```bash
GetModels
```

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-explore-adt-with-a-command-line-tool/CLITool-03.png" alt-text="Output message from the command getModels":::

Without any further options, the GetModels API only returns a list of model metadata. This can be useful, for example, to create UI that displays available models. To get the full model text try:

```bash
GetModels true
```

### Create Twins
Now that we have a model, we can create a twin. To do so, we need to specify the model id, a unique id for the new twin, and optionally, data to initialize properties on the twin.
The model we uploaded had the id **urn:example:Simple:1** (you can also get it again by typing GetModels once more)

Type:
```bash
CreateDigitalTwin urn:example:Simple:1 twin1
```

The model "simple" has a single property named data, which is of type twin. You can set the property when creating the twin:

```bash
CreateDigitalTwin urn:example:Simple:1 twin2 data string "Hello!"
```

### Find Twins
But how do you know that the twins really have been created? 

Let's run a query.

Type:
```bash
Query select * from digitaltwins
```

This will find all twins you currently have in your Azure Digital Twins service and list them with all their content. You might notice that there is quite a bit of extra content you have not specified yourself. The additional information is metadata about the twin that the DigitalTwins service captures and preserves for you.

```bash
{
  "$dtId": "twin2",
  "data": "Hello!",
  "$metadata": {
    "$model": "urn:example:Simple:1",
    "data": {
      "desiredValue": "Hello!",
      "desiredVersion": 1,
      "ackVersion": 1,
      "ackCode": 200,
      "ackDescription": "Auto-Sync"
    },
    "$kind": "DigitalTwin"
  }
}
```

Also note that twin2 contains a data property with the value "Hello!"

### Connect twins with relationships

The twin model "simple.json" also defines a relationship with the name "contains". Let's connect the two twins we created:

```bash
CreateEdge twin1 contains twin2 firstEdge
```

Note that relationships read like sentences noun-verb-noun. A relationship is like a verb that connect a subject and an object in a sentence.

We should verify that the relationship has been created.

Type:
```bash
GetEdges twin1
```

This will ist the outgoing edge from twin1. We can also find the incoming edges for twins. Try:

```bash
GetIncomingEdges twin2
```

That returns the perspective from "the other side".

## Modify a twin
Of course, we can also modify twin properties. Type this:

```bash
UpdateDigitalTwin twin1 add /data string Yes!
```

And to verify:
```bash
GetDigitalTwin twin1
```

As you will see, the twin property data has been updated.

Note that the underlying REST API uses JSON patch to define updates to a twin. The command line tool reflects this format so that you can experiment with what the underlying APIs actually expect.

### Errors

The sample application also handles errors from the service. Try to upload the same model you uploaded in the beginning again:

```bash
CreateModels Simple.json
```

As models cannot be overwritten, this will now return a service error:
```bash
Response 409: Service request failed.
Status: 409 (Conflict)

Content:
{"error":{"code":"DocumentAlreadyExists","message":"A document with same identifier already exists.","details":[]}}

Headers:
api-supported-versions: REDACTED
Date: Fri, 08 May 2020 01:53:52 GMT
Content-Length: 115
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

## Explore the commands - and explore the code

Please experiment with the commands and explore. Most importantly, look at the implementations of the commands and start tweaking and adding.

* The file Program.cs contains the authentication logic
* The file CommandLoop.cs contains all the interesting commands

Here is an example - creating a twin:
```csharp
Dictionary<string, object> meta = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
    { "$model", model_id},
    { "$kind", "DigitalTwin" }
};
Dictionary<string, object> twinData = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
    { "$metadata", meta },
};
try
{
    await client.CreateDigitalTwinAsync(twin_id, 
                    JsonConvert.SerializeObject(twinData));
    Log.Ok($"Twin '{twin_id}' created successfully!");
}
catch (RequestFailedException e)
{
    Log.Error($"Error {e.Status}: {e.Message}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Log.Error($"Error: {ex}");
}
```

In the next tutorial, we will use the sample command line tool as the centerpiece of an end to end application of Azure Digital Twins.
