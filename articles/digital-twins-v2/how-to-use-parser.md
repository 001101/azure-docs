## Parse models

As part of the Azure Digital Twins SDK, a DTDL parsing library is provided as a client-side library. This library provides model access to the DTDL definitionsâ€”effectively, the equivalent of C# reflection on DTDL. This library can be used independently of the Azure Digital Twins SDK; for example, for validation in a visual or text editor for DTDL. 

To use the parser library, you provide a set of DTDL documents to the library. Typically, you would retrieve these model documents from the service, but you might also have them available locally, if your client was responsible for uploading them to the service in the first place. 

The overall workflow is as follows.
1. You retrieve all (or, potentially, some) DTDL documents from the service.
2. You pass the returned in-memory DTDL documents to the parser.
3. The parser will validate the set of documents passed to it, and return detailed error information. This ability is useful in editor scenarios.
4. You can use the parser APIs to analyze the models included in the document set. 

The capabilities of the parser include:
* Get all implemented model interfaces (the contents of the interface's `extends` section).
* Get all properties, telemetry, commands, components, and relationships declared in the model. This command also gets all metadata included in these definitions and takes inheritance (`extends` sections) into account.
* Get all complex model definitions.
* Determine whether a model is assignable from another model.

> [!NOTE]
> [IoT Plug and Play (PnP)](../iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play.md) devices use a small syntax variant to describe their functionality. This syntax variant is a semantically compatible subset of the DTDL that is used in Azure Digital Twins. When using the parser library, you do not need to know which syntax variant was used to create the DTDL for your digital twin. The parser will always, by default, return the same model for both PnP and Azure Digital Twins syntax.

### Use the validator sample

There is sample code for a tool available that can validate model documents to make sure the DTDL is valid. It is built on the DTDL parser library and is language-agnostic. Find it here: [DTDL Validator tool sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-digital-twins/tree/private-preview/DTDL/DTDLValidator-Sample).

The validator sample can be used as a command line utility to validate a directory tree of dtdl files. It also provides an interactive mode. The source code shows examples for how to use the parser library.

See the readme.md file for the validator sample for instructions on how to package the tools into a self-contained executable.

Assuming you have built a self-contained package and added the executable to your path, you can use the validator as follows:

```bash
DTDLValidator
```
With the default options, the tool will search for `*.json` files in the current directory and all subdirectories.

```bash
DTDLValidator -d C:\Work\DTDL -e dtdl 
```

With these options, the tool will search in the indicated directory and all subdirectories for files with the extension *.dtdl

```bash
DTDLValidator -i
```

With the `-i` option, the tool will enter interactive mode.

Also see the source code and `DTDLValidator --help` for more information.

### Use the parser library in code

You can also use the parser library directly to validate models yourself.

To support the parser code example below, consider several models defined in an Azure Digital Twins instance:

> [!TIP] 
> The `dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMaker` model is using the *capability model* syntax, which implies that it was installed in the service by connecting a PnP device exposing that model.

```json
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMaker",
  "@type": "CapabilityModel",
  "implements": [
        { "name": "coffeeMaker", "schema": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMakerInterface" }
  ]    
}
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMakerInterface",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "contents": [
      { "@type": "Property", "name": "waterTemp", "schema": "double" }  
  ]
}
{
  "@id": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeBar",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "contents": [
        { "@type": "relationship", "contains": " dtmi:com:contoso:coffeeMaker" },
        { "@type": "property", "name": "capacity", "schema": "integer" }
  ]    
}
```

The following code shows an example of how to use the parser library to reflect on these definitions in C#:

```csharp
async void ParseDemo(DigitalTwinsClient client)
{
    try
    {
        AsyncPageable<ModelData> mdata = client.GetModelsAsync(null, true);
        List<string> models = new List<string>();
        await foreach (ModelData md in mdata)
            models.Add(md.Model);
        ModelParser parser = new ModelParser();
        IReadOnlyDictionary<Dtmi, DTEntityInfo> dtdlOM = await parser.ParseAsync(models);

        List<DTInterfaceInfo> interfaces = new List<DTInterfaceInfo>();
        IEnumerable<DTInterfaceInfo> ifenum = 
            from entity in dtdlOM.Values
            where entity.EntityKind == DTEntityKind.Interface
            select entity as DTInterfaceInfo;
        interfaces.AddRange(ifenum);
        foreach (DTInterfaceInfo dtif in interfaces)
        {
            PrintInterfaceContent(dtif, dtdlOM);
        }

    } catch (RequestFailedException rex)
    {

    }
}

void PrintInterfaceContent(DTInterfaceInfo dtif, IReadOnlyDictionary<Dtmi, DTEntityInfo> dtdlOM, int indent=0)
{
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < indent; i++) sb.Append("  ");
    Console.WriteLine($"{sb}Interface: {dtif.Id} | {dtif.DisplayName}");
    SortedDictionary<string, DTContentInfo> contents = dtif.Contents;
    foreach (DTContentInfo item in contents.Values)
    {
        switch (item.EntityKind)
        {
            case DTEntityKind.Property:
                DTPropertyInfo pi = item as DTPropertyInfo;
                Console.WriteLine($"{sb}--Property: {pi.Name} with schema {pi.Schema}");
                break;
            case DTEntityKind.Relationship:
                DTRelationshipInfo ri = item as DTRelationshipInfo;
                Console.WriteLine($"{sb}--Relationship: {ri.Name} with target {ri.Target}");
                break;
            case DTEntityKind.Telemetry:
                DTTelemetryInfo ti = item as DTTelemetryInfo;
                Console.WriteLine($"{sb}--Telemetry: {ti.Name} with schema {ti.Schema}");
                break;
            case DTEntityKind.Component:
                DTComponentInfo ci = item as DTComponentInfo;
                Console.WriteLine($"{sb}--Component: {ci.Id} | {ci.Name}");
                dtdlOM.TryGetValue(ci.Id, out DTEntityInfo value);
                DTInterfaceInfo component = value as DTInterfaceInfo;
                PrintInterfaceContent(component, dtdlOM, indent + 1);
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }
}
```
