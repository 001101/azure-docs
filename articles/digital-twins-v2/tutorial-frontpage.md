# Introduction to samples and tutorials

We have a few tutorials for Azure Digital Twins prepared for you. The tutorials are designed to progressively introduce Azure Digital Twins for you.

* The [Coding with the Azure Digital Twins APIs](./tutorial-code)  tutorial walks you through writing a simple C# console client app step by step, starting from scratch. You will use the command line and any code editor of your choice. 
* The [Explore Azure Digital Twins using a command line tool](./tutorial-explore-adt-with-a-command-line-tool.md) tutorial introduces a simple sample application that implements a command line tool to interact with an Azure Digital Twins instance. You can use this tool to perform essential Azure Digital Twins actions such as uploading and listing models, creating and modifying twins and relationships or manage event routes. You can learn the Azure Digital Twins APIs by looking at the code implementing the commands and modifying it as you desire.
* The [End-to-end tutorial](./tutorial-end-to-end.md) builds on the command line tool and adds other services around Azure Digital Twins to demonstrate a minimal end-to-end example that illustrates how to feed Azure Digital Twins with data and process the data using and Azure Function.
