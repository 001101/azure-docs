# Work with endpoints and routes in Azure Digital Twins

In Azure Digital Twins, you use **endpoints** to route data to downstream services, or to connect to compute resources. You can then define **event routes** to specify which events generated by Azure Digital Twins are delivered to which endpoints.

Supported endpoint types include:
* [Event Hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md)
* [Event Grid](../event-grid/overview.md)
* [Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md)

See [Choose between Azure messaging services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services) for more information on the different endpoints.

## Link an endpoint to Azure Digital Twins

To link an endpoint to Azure Digital Twins, the Event Hub, Event Grid topic, or Service Bus that you're using for the endpoint needs to exist already. 

The following example shows how to create an Event Grid topic using the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az eventgrid topic create -g <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-topic-name> -l "westcentralus"
```

Once you have created the topic, you can link it to Azure Digital Twins with the following command:

```azurecli
az dt endpoint create eventgrid --endpoint-name <Event-Grid-endpoint-name> --eventgrid-resource-group <Event-Grid-resource-group-name> --eventgrid-topic <your-Event-Grid-topic-name> -n <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name>
```

This makes the Event Grid topic available inside of Azure Digital Twins, under the name specified with the `--endpoint-name` argument. You will typically use that name as the target of an **event route**, which you'll create in the next section using the Azure Digital Twins service API.

Equivalent commands exist for Event Hub and Service Bus endpoints:

* Add Service Bus Topic endpoint (requires a pre-created Service Bus resource)
```azurecli 
az dt endpoint create servicebus --endpoint-name <Service-Bus-endpoint-name> --servicebus-resource-group <Service-Bus-resource-group-name> --servicebus-namespace <Service-Bus-namespace> --servicebus-topic <Service-Bus-topic-name> --servicebus-policy <Service-Bus-topic-policy> -n <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name>
```

* Add Event Hub endpoint (requires pre-created Event Hub resource)
```azurecli
az dt endpoint create eventhub --endpoint-name <Event-Hub-endpoint-name> --eventhub-resource-group <Event-Hub-resource-group> --eventhub-namespace <Event-Hub-namespace> --eventhub <Event-Hub-name> --eventhub-policy <Event-Hub-policy> -n <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name>
```

## Manage event routes with APIs

To actually send data from Azure Digital Twins to an endpoint, you need to define an event route. Azure Digital Twins **EventRoutes APIs** let developers wire up event flow, throughout the system and to downstream services. Read more about event routes in [Concepts: Routing Azure Digital Twins events](concepts-route-events.md).

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-generate-sdk.md](../../includes/digital-twins-generate-sdk.md)]

Event routes are defined using data plane APIs. A route definition can contain these elements:
* The route ID you want to use
* The ID of the endpoint you want to use
* A filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint 

If there is no route ID, no messages are routed outside of Azure Digital Twins. 
If there is a route ID and the filter is `null`, all messages are routed to the endpoint. 
If there is a route ID and a filter is added, messages will be filtered based on the filter.

One route should allow multiple notifications and event types to be selected. 

Here is the call to the SDK that is used to add an event route:

```csharp
await client.EventRoutes.AddAsync("routeName", new EventRoute("endpointID"));
```

> [!TIP]
> All SDK functions come in synchronous and asynchronous versions.

### Event route sample code

The following code sample shows how to create, list and delete an event route:
```csharp
try
{
    Log("Create a route: testRoute1");
    EventRoute er = new EventRoute(<your-endpoint-name>,true);
    await client.EventRoutes.AddAsync(<your-route-name>, er);
    Log("Create route succeeded. Now listing routes:");
    List<EventRoute> routes = await ListRoutes();
    Log("Deleting routes:");
    foreach (EventRoute r in routes)
    {
        Log($"Deleting route {r.Id}:");
        await client.EventRoutes.DeleteAsync(r.Id);
        Log("Delete route succeeded."); 
    }
}
catch (ErrorResponseException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"*** Error in event route creation ({e.Request.RequestUri}):\n${e.Response.StatusCode}\n${e.Response.ReasonPhrase}");
}
```

The `ListRoutes` routine used by the code above is defined as follows:

```csharp
static async Task<List<EventRoute>> ListRoutes()
{
    List<EventRoute> evList = new List<EventRoute>();
    // Find the relationships for the twin
    try
    {
        
        // Enumerate the IPage object returned to get the results
        // ListAsync will throw if an error occurs
        IPage<EventRoute> evPage = await client.EventRoutes.ListAsync();
        evList.AddRange(evPage);
        // If there are more pages, the NextPageLink in the page is set
        while (evPage.NextPageLink != null)
        {
            // Get more pages...
            evPage = await client.EventRoutes.ListNextAsync(evPage.NextPageLink);
            evList.AddRange(evPage);
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Found {evList.Count} event routes");
        // Let's delete the edges we found
        foreach (EventRoute r in evList)
        {
            Log($"Found route {r.Id} to {r.EndpointId}");
        }
    }
    catch (ErrorResponseException e)
    {
        Log($"*** Error retrieving event routes: {e.Response.StatusCode}", ConsoleColor.Red);
    }
    return evList;
}
``` 

### Filter events

Without filtering, endpoints receive a variety of events from Azure Digital Twins:
* Telemetry fired by twins using the Azure Digital Twins service API
* Twin property change notifications, fired on property changes for any twin in the Azure Digital Twins instance
* Life-cycle events, fired when twins or relationships are created or deleted
* Model change events, fired when models configured in an Azure Digital Twins instance are added or deleted

You can restrict these by adding a filter to an endpoint.

To add a filter, you can use a PUT request to *https://{YourHost}/ EventRoutes/myNewRoute?api-version=2020-03-01-preview* with the following body:

```json  
{
    "endpointId": "<endpoint-ID>",
    "filter": "<filter-text>"
}
``` 

## Supported Route Filters

| Filter name | Description | Filter Schema | Supported Values | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type | The class of event flowing through your Twin instance | "filter" : "type = <[eventType](./concepts-route-events.md#types-of-event-messages)>" | `Microsoft.DigitalTwins.Twin.Create` <br> `Microsoft.DigitalTwins.Twin.Delete` <br> `Microsoft.DigitalTwins.Twin.Update`<br>`Microsoft.DigitalTwins.Edge.Create`<br>`Microsoft.DigitalTwins.Edge.Update`<br>`Microsoft.DigitalTwins.Edge.Delete` <br> `Microsoft.iot.Telemetry`  |
| Source | Name of Digital Twins instance | "filter" : "source = \<hostname\>" |  `<yourDigitalTwinInstance>.<yourRegion>.azuredigitaltwins.net` |
| Subject | This describes the subject of the event in the context of the event source above | "filter": " subject = \<subject\>" |`<twinid>` <br> or a URI format for subjects which are uniquely identified by multiple parts or ids:<br>`<twinid>/relationships/<relationship>/<edged>`|
| Content type | Content type of data value, This attribute enables data to carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from that of the chosen event format | "filter": "datacontenttype = \<contentType\>" | `application/json` <br> `application/json` for Edge.Create or `application/json-patch+json`for Edge.Update|
| Spec version | The version of the event schema you are using. | "filter": "specversion = \<version\>" | Defaults to `1.0` to describe the CloudEvents schema version 1.0. Can be set to any custom double value if you are using a custom event specification |
| Enabled | Allows creating a route with no filtering, or temporarily disabling a route | "filter" : "\<enabled\>" | `true` = route is enabled with no filtering <br> `false` = route is disabled |
<!--
| ID | *Not implemented for public preview* | "filter": "id = '…'" | |
| Schema | *Not implemented for public preview*  | "filter": "dataschema = '…'" | |
-->

It is also possible to combine filters using the following operations:

| Filter name | Filter Schema | Example | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| AND / OR | "filter": "\<filter1\> AND \<filter2\>" | `"filter": "type != Microsoft.iot.Telemetry AND datacontenttype = application/json"` |
| AND / OR | "filter": "\<filter1\> AND \<filter2\>" | `"filter": "type != Microsoft.iot.Telemetry OR datacontenttype = application/json"` |
| Nested operations | "filter": "(\<Comparison1\>) AND (\<Comparison2\>)" | `"filter": "(type != Microsoft.iot.Telemetry OR datacontenttype = application/json) OR (specversion != 1.0)"` |

> [!NOTE]
> During preview, only string equality is supported (=, !=).

When you implement or update a filter, the change may take a few minutes to be reflected in the data pipeline.

## Manage endpoints and routes with CLI

Endpoints and routes can also be managed using the Azure Digital Twins CLI. The commands for this can be found in [How-to: Use the Azure Digital Twins CLI](how-to-use-cli.md).

## Monitor event routes

Routing metrics such as count, latency and failure rate can be viewed in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

From the portal homepage, search for your Azure Digital Twins instance to pull up its details. Select the **Metrics** option from the Azure Digital Twins instance's menu to bring up the *Metrics* page.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-routes/metrics.png" alt-text="Metrics page of an Azure Digital Twins instance in the Azure portal":::

From here, you can view the metrics for your instance and create custom views.
