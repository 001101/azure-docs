# Event routes (preview)

It is often useful for data from Azure Digital Twins to be sent to downstream data services for additional storage or processing. 

For example...
* A hospital may want to send Azure Digital Twins event data to [Time Series Insights (TSI)](../time-series-insights/time-series-insights-update-overview.md), to record time series data of handwashing-related events for bulk analytics.
* A business that is already using [Azure Maps](../azure-maps/about-azure-maps.md) may want to use Azure Digital Twins to enhance their solution. They can quickly enable an Azure Map after setting up Azure Digital Twins, bring Azure Map entities into Azure Digital Twins as digital twins in the twin graph, or run powerful queries leveraging their Azure Maps and Azure Digital Twins data together.

Data egress for scenarios like these is handled using **event routes**. 

An event route lets you send event data from nodes in Azure Digital Twins to custom-defined endpoints in your subscriptions. Three Azure services are currently supported for endpoints: [Event Hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md), [Event Grid](../event-grid/overview.md), and [Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md). Each of these Azure services can be connected to other services and acts as the middleman, sending data along to final destinations such as TSI or Azure Maps for whatever processing you desire.

The following diagram illustrates the flow of event data through a larger IoT solution with an Azure Digital Twins piece:

## Uses for event routes

Event routes are designed for sending data to external resources. They excel at sending bulk event data from Azure Digital Twins to downstream resources such as TSI, Azure Maps, storage, and analytics solutions.

During the current preview release, they are also used to handle events within the twin graph and send data from Azure digital twin to Azure digital twin. You can use event routes to affect Azure Digital Twins resources by connecting routes to compute resources such as [Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md). Note that events sent via routes come without context. As a result, a compute resource that wants to modify the Azure Digital Twins twin graph in response to an event passed via event route must either:
* know the digital twin it wants to modify in advance, or
* use a query or navigation through the twin graph to find the appropriate target. 

It also needs to establish security and access permissions independently.

## Create a route endpoint

To define an event route, developers first must define endpoints. An **endpoint** is a destination outside of Azure Digital Twins that supports a route connection. Supported destinations in current preview release are:
* Event Grid custom topics
* Event Hub
* Service Bus

Endpoints are set up using control plane APIs (supported by the [Azure Digital Twins CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-digital-twins/tree/private-preview/CLI)), or via the portal. An endpoint definition gives:
* The endpoint's ID (or friendly name)
* The endpoint type (Event Grid, Event Hub, or Service Bus)
* The primary connection string and secondary connection string to authenticate 
* The topic path of the endpoint, such as *your-topic.westus.eventgrid.azure.net*

The endpoint APIs that are available in control plane are:
* Create endpoint
* Get list of endpoints
* Get endpoint by ID (similar to above, but pass in endpointID)
* Delete endpoint by ID

## Create a route
 
Event routes are created with the following [Azure Digital Twins API](how-to-use-apis.md) call: 

`Response RegisterEventRoute(string routeId, string endpointId, string topic, string filter);`

* The `endpointId` identifies an endpoint, such as an Event Hub, Event Grid, or Service Bus. These endpoints must be created in your subscription and attached to Azure Digital Twins using control plane APIs before making this registration call.
* If a topic is specified and the registered endpoint supports topics, the `topic` field is used to send the message to the specified topic. 
* By default, an event route accepts and routes every single message generated by the system. The `filter` parameter allows you to selectively route messages based on event types (such as telemetry events, digital twin property change events, life-cycle events, etc.), or by other parameters such as twin type model. In this way, you can create selective routes. 

### Create selective routes with filters

To selectively route event messages as described above, you will provide a filter expressed as a **message routing query**. Filters are written in a single query language.

These are the categories of filters that are supported by Azure Digital Twins: 
* Filter on message type
* Filter on digital twin (no traversal of graph)
* Filter on message/notification body
* Filter on message properties

### Types of event messages

A common way to implement selective routing is to filter based on message type. Different types of events in IoT Hub and Azure Digital Twins produce different types of notification messages, as described below.
