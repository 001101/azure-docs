# Developer overview of Azure Digital Twins APIs

This article gives a brief overview of the API surface of Azure Digital Twins. 
The Azure Digital Twins API surface can be broadly divided into the following categories: 

* **Model Management APIs** - The Model Management APIs are used to manage the [twin types](concepts-models.md) in an Azure Digital Twins instance. Management activities include upload, validation, and retrieval of twin types authored in DTDL.
* **Twin APIs** - The Twin APIs let developers create, modify, and delete [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) and their relationships in an Azure Digital Twins instance.
* **Query APIs** - The Query APIs let developers [find sets of digital twins in the twin graph](concepts-query-graph.md) across relationships and applying filters.
* **Event and Routing APIs** - The Event APIs let developers [wire up event flow](concepts-route-events.md) through the system, as well as to downstream services.

## Azure Digital Twins SDKs (preview)

During preview, to generate an SDK for the language of your choice, use [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) with the Azure Digital Twins Swagger.
