# Developer overview of Azure Digital Twins APIs

This article gives a brief overview of the API surface of Azure Digital Twins. 
The Azure Digital Twins API surface can be broadly divided into the following categories: 

* **Model Management APIs** - The Model Management APIs are used to manage the [twin types](concepts-models.md) in an Azure Digital Twins instance. Management activities include upload, validation, and retrieval of twin types authored in DTDL.
* **Twin APIs** - The Twin APIs let developers create, modify, and delete [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) and their relationships in an Azure Digital Twins instance.
* **Query APIs** - The Query APIs let developers [find sets of digital twins in the twin graph](concepts-query-graph.md) across relationships, by applying filters.
* **Event and Routing APIs** - The Event APIs let developers [wire up event flow](concepts-route-events.md) through the system, as well as to downstream services.

## Generating Azure Digital Twins SDKs (preview)

For private preview, Azure Digital Twins does not ship with an SDK. You can either use the REST APIs directly, or you can generate an SDK using Autorest. We will provide official SDKs for ADT at a later date. 

To generate an SDK, you will need:
* [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest). Make sure you use version 2.0.4413.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as a pre-requisite to Autorest
* The OpenAPI (swagger) file that contains the [ADT API definitions](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/Azure-IoT-DigitalTwins-Main?path=%2Fproducts%2Fswagger%2Fexternal-data-plane%2Fpreview%2F2020-03-01-preview%2Fdigitaltwins.json&version=GBmaster&_a=contents).

If you have node installed, you can make sure that you have the right version of Autorest installed using:
```bash
npm install -g autorest@2.0.4413
```

To run Autorest against the ADT swagger file:
* Copy the ADT swagger file in a working directory
* On a command prompt, switch to that working directory
* Run autorest:

```bash
autorest --input-file=adtApiSwagger.json --csharp --output-folder=ADTApi --add-credentials --azure-arm --namespace=ADTApi
```

As a result, you will see a new folder named ADTApi in your working directory. The generated SDK files will have the namespace ADTApi, which we will continue to use in the following examples

## Adding the SDK to a Visual Studio Project

You can include the C# files generated by Autorest directly into a .NET solution. However, for better usability, we recommend that you create the SDK as a separate project, that you then can include into your main solution.

This section explains how to do that.

[ToDo]Add screen shots

* Create a new visual studio solution for a C# class library
* Use the name ADTApi as the project name
* In Solutions Explorer, right-click the ADTApi project of the generated solution and select Add>Existing Item...
* Find the folder where you generated the SDK and select the C# files at the root level
* Click OK
* Add a folder to the project (right-click on the project in solution explorer, and select Add>New Folder)
* Name the folder "Models"
* Right-click the Models folder in Solutions Explorer and select Add>Existing Item...
* Select the C# files in the Models folder of the generated SDK and press Ok

To build the SDK successfully, you need to add references to:
* Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime and 
* Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime.Azure

To do so, open Tools>NuGet Package Manager>Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...

* In the panel, make sure the Browse tab is selected
* Search for Microsoft.Rest
* Select the ClientRuntime and ClientRuntime.Azure packages and add them to your solution

You can now build the project, and include it as a project reference in any ADT application you wish to write
