# Route telemetry and event data to outside services

Azure Digital Twins **EventRoutes APIs** let developers wire-up event flow throughout the system, as well as to downstream services.

## Routes

Event routes are defined using data plane APIs. A route definition contains:
* The desired route ID 
* The desired endpoint ID
* A filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint 

One route should allow multiple notifications and event types to be selected. 

If there is no route, no messages are routed outside of Azure Digital Twins. If there is a route and the filter is `null`, all messages are routed to the endpoint. If there is a route and a filter is added, messages will be filtered based on the filter.

**Note**: During this preview, filters are not supported. Please use Event Grid as an endpoint with an Event Grid subscription filter to use selective messaging.

In SDK form:

```csharp
await client.EventRoutes.AddAsync("routeName", new EventRoute("endpointID"));
```
);`

## Message examples

In order to explain the message routing query, here are two sample messages of telemetry and notification:

Telemetry message

```json
{ 
    "specversion": "1.0", 
    "type": "microsoft.iot.telemetry", 
    "source": "myhub.westcentralus.azuredigitaltwins.net", 
    "subject": "thermostat.vav-123", 
    "id": "c1b53246-19f2-40c6-bc9e-4666fa590d1a",
    "dataschema": "urn:contosocom:example:DigitalTwins:VAV:1",
    "time": "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z", 
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json", 
    "data":  
      {
          "temp": 70,
          "humidity": 40 
      }
}
```

Life-cycle notifications message

```json
{ 
    "specversion": "1.0", 
    "type": "microsoft.digitaltwins.twin.create", 
    "source": "mydigitaltwins.westcentralus.azuredigitaltwins.net", 
    "subject": "device-123", 
    "id": "c1b53246-19f2-40c6-bc9e-4666fa590d1a", 
    "time": "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z", 
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json", 
    "dataschema": "urn:contosocom:example:DigitalTwins:Device:1",           
    "data":  
      { 
        "$dtId": "room-123", 
        "property": "value",
        "$metadata": { 
                //...
        } 
      } 
}
```

## Route event types and message formats

Recall the types of notifications that can be generated and used for event routing:

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-notifications.md](../../includes/digital-twins-notifications.md)]

Notifications allow the solution backend to be notified when below actions are happening. The sections that follow describe the types of notifications emitted by IoT Hub and Azure Digital Twins, or other Azure IoT services. 

Notifications are made up of two parts: the header and the body. 

### Notification headers

In this section, you will learn about notification message headers as key-value pairs, and the message bodies as JSON. Depending on the protocol used (MQTT, AMQP, or HTTP), message headers will be serialized differently. Depending on the serialization desired for the message body (such as with JSON, CBOR, Protobuf, etc.), the message body may be serialized differently as well. This section discusses the format for telemetry messages, regardless of the specific protocol and serialization chosen.

Some notifications conform to the CloudEvents standard. CloudEvents conformance is as follows.
* Notifications emitted from devices continue to follow the existing specifications for notifications
* Notifications processed and emitted by IoT Hub continue to follow the existing specifications for notification, except where IoT Hub chooses to support CloudEvents, such as through Event Grid
* Notifications emitted from Azure digital twin based on twin types conform to CloudEvents
* Notifications processed and emitted by Azure Digital Twins conform to CloudEvents

Services have to add a sequence number on all the notifications to indicate order of notifications, or otherwise perform their own actions to maintain ordering. Notifications emitted by Azure Digital Twins to Event Grid are formatted into the Event Grid schema, until Event Grid supports CloudEvents on input. Extension attributes on headers will be added as properties on the Event Grid schema inside of the payload.  

### Digital twin life-cycle notifications

All Azure digital twins are emitting notifications, regardless of whether they represent [IoT Hub devices in Azure Digital Twins](how-to-ingest-iot-hub-data.md) or not.

#### Notification triggers

These notifications are triggered when:
* An Azure digital twin is created
* An Azure digital twin is deleted
* A proxy is attached to an IoT Hub device
* A proxy is detached from its associated IoT Hub device

#### Properties

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| id | Identifier of the notification, such as a UUID or a counter maintained by the service. `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event |
| source | Name of the IoT hub or Azure Digital Twins instance, like *myhub.azure-devices.net* or *mydigitaltwins.westcentralus.azuredigitaltwins.net* |
| specversion | 1.0 |
| type | `Microsoft.<Service RP>.Twin.Create`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.Twin.Delete`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.TwinProxy.Create`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.TwinProxy.Delete`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.TwinProxy.Attach`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.TwinProxy.Detach` |
| datacontenttype | application/json |
| subject | ID of the Azure digital twin |
| time | Timestamp for when the operation occurred on the twin |
| sequence, sequencetype | See earlier detail on notification headers |

#### Body

This section includes an Azure digital twin payload in a JSON format. The schema for this is *Digital Twins Resource 7.1*. The body is always the state after the resource is created, so it should include all system generated-elements just like a `GET` call.
Here is an example of body for [IoT Plug and Play (PnP)](../iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play.md) devices, with components and no top-level properties. Properties that do not make sense for devices (such as reported properties) should be omitted.

```json
{
  "$dtId": "device-digitaltwin-01",
  "thermostat": {
    "temperature": 80,
    "humidity": 45,
    "$metadata": {
      "$model": "urn:contosocom:example:Thermostat:1",
      "temperature": {
        "desiredValue": 85,
        "desiredVersion": 3,
        "ackVersion": 2,
        "ackCode": 200,
        "ackDescription": "OK"
      },
      "humidity": {
        "desiredValue": 40,
        "desiredVersion": 1,
        "ackVersion": 1,
        "ackCode": 200,
        "ackDescription": "OK"
      }
    }
  },
  "$metadata": {
    "$model": "urn:contosocom:example:Thermostat_X500:1",
  }
}
```

Here is another example of an Azure digital twin based on a twin type, that does not support components:

```json
{
  "$dtId": "logical-digitaltwin-01",
  "avgTemperature": 70,
  "comfortIndex": 85,
  "$metadata": {
    "$model": "urn:contosocom:example:Building:1",
    "$kind": "DigitalTwin",
    "avgTemperature": {
      "desiredValue": 72,
      "desiredVersion": 5,
      "ackVersion": 4,
      "ackCode": 200,
      "ackDescription": "OK"
    },
    "comfortIndex": {
      "desiredValue": 90,
      "desiredVersion": 1,
      "ackVersion": 3,
      "ackCode": 200,
      "ackDescription": "OK"
    }
  }
}
```

### Digital twin edge change notifications

These notifications are triggered when any relationship edge of an Azure digital twin is created, updated, or deleted. 

#### Properties

| Name    | Value |
| --- | --- |
| id    | Identifier of the notification, such as a UUID or a counter maintained by the service. `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event |
| source    | Name of the Azure Digital Twins instance, like *mydigitaltwins.westcentralus.azuredigitaltwins.net* |
| specversion    | 1.0 |
| type    | `Microsoft.<Service RP>.Edge.Create`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.Edge.Update`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.Edge.Delete`<br>`datacontenttype    application/json for Edge.Create`<br>`application/json-patch+json for Edge.Update` |
| subject    | ID of the relationship edge, like `<twinID>/relationships/<relationshipName>/<edgeID>` |
| time    | Timestamp for when the operation occurred on the relationship edge |
| sequence, sequencetype    | See earlier detail on notification headers |

#### Body

This section includes payload in a JSON format for creating and deleting a relationship edge. It uses the same format as a `GET` request for a relationship via the [DigitalTwins API](how-to-use-apis.md). "Updating a relationship" means properties of the relationship edge have changed. 
For `Edge.Delete`, the body is the same as the `GET` request, and it gets the latest state before deletion.
Here is an example of a create or delete edge notification:

```json
{
    "$edgeId": "EdgeId1",
    "$sourceId": "building11",
    "$relationship": "Contains",
    "$targetId": "floor11",
    "ownershipUser": "user1",
    "ownershipDepartment": "Operations"
}
```

Here is an example of an update edge notification to update a property:

```json
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "ownershipUser",
    "value": "user3"
  }
]
```

### Digital twin type change notifications

These notifications are triggered when a Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) [twin type](concepts-twin-types.md) is uploaded, reloaded, patched, decommissioned, or deleted.

#### Properties

| Name    | Value |
| --- | --- |
| id    | Identifier of the notification, such as a UUID or a counter maintained by the service. `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event |
| source    | Name of the IoT hub or Azure Digital Twins instance, like *myhub.azure-devices.net* or *mydigitaltwins.westcentralus.azuredigitaltwins.net* |
| specversion    | 1.0 |
| type    | `Microsoft.<Service RP>.Model.Upload`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.Model.Reload` (Hub-specific)<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.Model.Patch` (Hub-specific)<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.Model.Decom`<br>`Microsoft.<Service RP>.Model.Delete` |
| datacontenttype    | application/json |
| subject    | ID of the twin type, in the form `urn:<domain>:<unique twin type identifier>:<twin type version number>` |
| time    | Timestamp for when the operation occurred on the twin type |
| sequence    | Value expressing the event's position in the larger ordered sequence of events. Services have to add a sequence number on all the notifications to indicate order of notifications, or otherwise perform their own actions to maintain ordering. Sequence will be incremented for each subject, and will be reset to 1 every time the object gets recreated with the same ID (such as during delete and recreate operations). |
| sequencetype    | The exact value and meaning of sequence. For example, this property may specify that the value must be a string-encoded, signed, 32-bit integer that starts with 1, and increases by 1 for each subsequent value |
| modelstatus    | The resolution status for resolving a twin type. Possible values: Successful/NotFound/Failed (IoT Hub only) | 
| updatereason    | Update twin type reason in the schema. Possible values: Create/Reset/Override (IoT Hub only) | 

#### Body

No body for upload, reload, and patch twin type. User must make a `GET` call to get the twin type content. 
For `Model.Delete`, the request body is the same as a `GET` request, and it gets the latest state before deletion.
For and `Model.Decom`, the body of the patch will be in JSON patch format, like all other patch APIs in the Azure Digital Twins API surface. That is, to decommission a twin type, you would use:

```json
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/decommissionedState",
    "value": true
  }
]
```

### Digital twin change notifications

These notifications are triggered when an Azure digital twin is being updated, like:
* When property values or metadata changes.
* When digital twin or component metadata changes. An example of this scenario is changing the twin type of a digital twin.

#### Properties

| Name    | Value |
| --- | --- |
| id    | Identifier of the notification, such as a UUID or a counter maintained by the service. `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event |
| source    | Name of the IoT hub or Azure Digital Twins instance, like *myhub.azure-devices.net* or *mydigitaltwins.westcentralus.azuredigitaltwins.net*
| specversion    | 1.0 |
| type    | `Microsoft.<Service RP>.Twin.Update` |
| datacontenttype    | application/json-patch+json |
| subject    | ID of the digital twin |
| time    | Timestamp for when the operation occurred on the digital twin |
| sequence, sequencetype    | See earlier detail on notification headers |

#### Body

The body for the `Twin.Update` notification is a JSON Patch document containing the update to the Azure digital twin.
For example, for the following PATCH digital twin:

```json
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/mycomp/prop1",
    "value": {"a":3}
  }
]
```

The corresponding notification (if synchronously executed by the service, such as Azure Digital Twins updating a digital twin) would contain a body like:

```json
[
    { "op": "replace", "path": "/myComp/prop1", "value": {"a": 3}},
    { "op": "replace", "path": "/myComp/$metadata/prop1",
        "value": {
            "desiredValue": { "a": 3 },
            "desiredVersion": 2,
                "ackCode": 200,
            "ackVersion": 2 
        }
    }
]
```
