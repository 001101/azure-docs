# Automate Log Analytics processes with the connector for Microsoft Flow

Do you find yourself repeatedly running the same queries on your telemetry data to check that your service is functioning properly? Are you looking to automate these queries for finding trends and anomalies and then build your own workflows around them? The Azure Application Insights connector (preview) for Microsoft Flow is the right tool for these purposes.

With this integration, you can now automate numerous processes without writing a single line of code. After you create a flow by using an Application Insights action, the flow automatically runs your Application Insights Analytics query. 

You can add additional actions as well. Microsoft Flow makes hundreds of actions available. For example, you can use Microsoft Flow to automatically send an email notification or create a bug in Visual Studio Team Services. You can also use one of the many [templates](https://ms.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/shared_applicationinsights/?slug=azure-application-insights) that are available for the connector for Microsoft Flow. These templates speed up the process of creating a flow. 

<!--The Application Insights connector also works with [Azure Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/?v=17.23h). -->

You can wait for the trigger to run this action, or you can run the flow immediately by [running the trigger on demand](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/run-now-and-six-more-services/).

When the flow runs, the recipients you have specified in the email list receive an email message that looks like the following:
