# Custom dashboards in Log Analytics

Custom dashboards have been deprecated with the [new Log Analytics query language](log-analytics-log-search-upgrade.md).  This functionality has been replaced by [View Designer](log-analytics-view-designer.md).

When your workspace is upgraded, any dashboards that you had previously created will become read only.  You can't edit these dashboards or create new ones. 



## Next steps
* Create [alerts](log-analytics-alerts.md) in Log Analytics to generate notifications and to remediate problems.
