# Manage cost of data volume with your Log Analytics workspace
When you sign up for Log Analytics, depending on the plan you select, there is a limit to how long the data generated by your connected sources is stored in your workspace.  This article highlights the considerations that can influence costs to retain this data for different periods of time and how to configure that limit.   

Because Log Analytics can consume large amounts of data from sources hosted on-premise, cloud or hybrid environments, the cost of data can be considerable depending on the following factors: 

- Number of systems, infrastructure components, cloud resources, etc. you are collecting from 
- Type of data created by the source, such as message queues, logs, events, security-related data, or performance metrics 
- Volume of data generated by these sources and ingested to the workspace 
- The period data is retained in the workspace  
- Number of Management solutions enabled, data source, and collection frequency 

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the documentation for each solution as it provides an estimate of how much data it collects.   

If you are on the *Free* plan, data is limited to 7 days retention. For the *Standalone* or *Paid* tier, data collected is available for the last 31 days. The *Free* plan has 500 MB daily ingestion limit, and if you find that you consistently exceed the amounts allowed volume, you can change your workspace to a paid plan to collect data beyond this limit. 

> [!NOTE]
> Charges apply if you choose to select a longer retention period for the paid tier. You can change your plan type at any time and for more information on pricing, see [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/log-analytics/). 

There are two ways in which the volume of data can be limited and help control your cost, these are daily cap and data retention.  

## Review estimated cost
Log Analytics makes it easy to understand what the costs are likely be based on recent usage patterns.  To do this, perform the following steps.  

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). 
2. Click **More services** found on the lower left-hand corner. In the list of resources, type **Log Analytics**. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. Select **Log Analytics**.
3. In the Log Analytics subscriptions pane, select your workspace and then click **Usage and estimated costs**  from the left-hand pane.<br>[Usage and estimated costs page](log-analytics-manage-cost/)<br>

From here you can review your data volume for the month. This includes all the data received and retained in your Log Analytics workspace.  Click **Usage details** from the top of the page to view the usage dashboard with information on data volume trends by source, computers and offering. To view and set a daily cap or to modify the retention period, click **Data volume management**.
 
Log Analytics charges are added to your Azure bill. You can see details of your Azure bill under the Billing section of the Azure portal or in the [Azure Billing Portal](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions).  


## Change the data retention period 

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). 
2. Click **More services** found in the upper left-hand corner. In the list of resources, type **Log Analytics**. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. Select **Log Analytics**.
3. In the Log Analytics subscriptions pane, select your workspace to modify from the list.
4. On the Workspace page, click **Retention** from the left-hand pane.
5. On the workspace retention pane, move the slider to increase or decrease the number of days and then click **Save**.  If you are on the *free* tier, you will not be able to modify the data retention period and you need to upgrade to the paid tier in order to control this setting.<br><br> ![Change workspace data retention setting](media/log-analytics-manage-cost/manage-cost-change-retention.png)

## Daily cap
When creating a Log Analytics workspace from the Azure portal and you choose the *Free* plan, it is set to a 500 MB per day limit. There are no limits for the other pricing plans. You can configure a daily cap and limit the daily ingestion for your workspace, but use care as your goal should not be to hit the daily limit.  Otherwise at that point, you will lose data for the remainder of the day and your ability to observe the health conditions of resources supporting IT services is impacted.  The daily cap is intended to be used as a way to manage the unexpected increase in data volume from your managed resources and stay within your limit, or when you want to simply limit unplanned charges for your workspace.  

When the daily limit is reached, a warning banner appears across the top of the page for the selected Log Analytics workspace and an operation event is sent to the *Operation* table under **LogManagement** category. We recommend defining an alert rule based on this operation event, configured to notify when the daily data limit has been reached. 

### Identify what daily data limit to define 
Review [Log Analytics Usage and estimated costs](log-analytics-usage.md) to understand the data ingestion trend and what is the daily volume cap to define. It should be considered with care, since you won’t be able to monitor your resources after the limit is reached. 

### Manage the maximum daily data volume 
1. Sign into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). 
2. Click **More services** found in the upper left-hand corner. In the list of resources, type **Log Analytics**. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. Select **Log Analytics**.
3. In the Log Analytics subscriptions pane, select your workspace to modify from the list.   
4. Click **Usage and estimated costs** from the left pane, and then click **Data volume management**. 
5. Daily cap is **OFF** by default – click **ON** to enable it, and then set the data volume limit in GB/day. 

## Troubleshooting
**Question**: How do I troubleshoot if Log Analytics is no longer collecting data? 
**Answer**:  If you are on the free pricing tier and have sent more than 500 MB of data in a day, data collection stops for the rest of the day. Reaching the daily limit is a common reason that Log Analytics stops collecting data, or data appears to be missing.  
Log Analytics creates an event of type Operation when data collection starts and stops.  
Run the following query in search to check if you are reaching the daily limit and missing data: Operation | where OperationCategory == 'Data Collection Status'   
When data collection stops, the OperationStatus is Warning. When data collection starts, the OperationStatus is Succeeded.  
The following table describes reasons that data collection stops and a suggested action to resume data collection:  

|Reason collection stops| Solution| 
|-----------------------|---------|
|Daily limit of free data reached<sup>1</sup>|Wait until the following day for collection to automatically restart, or change to a paid pricing tier.|
|Daily limit you defined in Data volume management reached|Wait until the following day for collection to automatically restart, or increase the daily data volume limit described in [manage the maximum daily data volume](#manage-the-maximum-daily-volume)|
|Azure subscription is in a suspended state due to:<br> Free trial ended<br> Azure pass expired<br> Monthly spending limit reached (for example on an MSDN or Visual Studio subscription)|Convert to a paid subscription<br> Convert to a paid subscription<br> Remove limit, or wait until limit resets|

<sup>1</sup> If your workspace is on the free pricing tier, you're limited to sending 500 MB of data per day to the service. When you reach the daily limit, data collection stops until the next day. Data sent while data collection is stopped is not indexed and is not available for searching. When data collection resumes, processing occurs only for new sent data. 

Log Analytics uses UTC time. The reset time varies between workspaces to prevent all capped workspaces start ingesting data at the same time. If the workspace reaches the daily limit, processing resumes after the reset time defined in **Daily limit will be set at**.  

**Question**: How can I be notified when data collection stops? 
**Answer**: Use the steps described in *Create daily data cap* alert to be notified when data collection stops and follow the steps Use the steps described in add actions to alert rules configure an e-mail, webhook, or runbook action for the alert rule.
