# Log Analytics query language

[Log Analytics](../log-analytics-queries.md) provides log collection and analysis for [Azure Monitor](/azure-monitor/overview.md). It's built on [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/) and uses a version of the same [query language](/azure/kusto).

## Concepts
- [Analyze Log Analytics data in Azure Monitor](../log-analytics-queries.md) gives a brief overview of log queries and describes how Log Analytics data is structured.
- [Viewing and analyzing data in Log Analytics](../log-analytics-log-search-portals.md) explains the portals where you create and run Log Analytics queries.

## Reference

- [Query language reference](/azure/kusto/query)  is the complete language reference for the query language.
- [Log Analytics query language differences](kusto-difference.md) describes differences between versions of the Data Explorer query language.


## Next steps

- Walk through a lesson on writing on a [Log Analytics query](/log-analytics/query-language/get-started-queries.md).
