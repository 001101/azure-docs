# Viewing and analyzing Azure logs

There are two options available in the Azure portal for analyzing log data and creating queries for ad hoc analysis. 

You use log searches in a variety of places throughout Log Analytics to retrieve data from the workspace.  For actually creating and editing queries in addition to working interactively with returned data though, you have two options that are described below.  

## Log explorer (preview)
Log explorer is new experience for working with log data and creating queries. You can get an introduction to this portal and inspect its features at [Get started with the Azure Monitor Log explorer](query-language/get-started-analytics-portal.md).

Log explorer provides the following improvements over the [Log search](#log-search) experience.

* Multiple tabs – create separate tabs to work with multiple queries.
* Rich visualizations – variety of charting options.
* Improved Intellisense and language auto-completion.
* Syntax highlighting – improves readability of queries. 
* Query explorer – access saved queries and functions.
* Schema view – review the structure of your data to assist in writing queries.
* Share – create links to queries, or pin queries to any shared Azure dashboard.
* Smart Analytics - identifies spikes in your charts and a quick analysis of the cause.
* Column selection – sort and group columns in the query results.

> [!NOTE]
> Log explorer has the same functionality as the Advanced Analytics portal which is an external tool outside of the Azure portal. The Advanced Analytics portal is still available, but links and other references to it in the Azure portal are being replaced with Log explorer.

### Firewall requirements
Your browser requires access to the following addresses to access Log explorer and the Advanced Analytics portal.  If your browser is accessing the Azure portal through a firewall, you must enable access to these addresses.

| Uri | IP | Ports |
|:---|:---|:---|
| portal.loganalytics.io | Dynamic | 80,443 |
| api.loganalytics.io    | Dynamic | 80,443 |
| docs.loganalytics.io   | Dynamic | 80,443 |


## Log search
The Log search page is suitable for analyzing log data using basic queries. It provides multiple features for editing queries without having a full knowledge of the query language.  You can get a summary of these features in [Create log searches in Azure Log Analytics using Log Search](log-analytics-log-search-log-search-portal.md).
