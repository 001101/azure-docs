# Transition from OMS portal to Azure portal for Log Analytics users
Today, the Azure portal is a hub for all Azure services and offers a rich management experience with capabilities such as dashboards for pinning resources, intelligent search for finding resources, and tagging for resource management. But certain Log Analytics monitoring capabilities were only available in the OMS portal, and as a result, you often had to go back and forth between the Azure portal and the OMS portal. To provide a single streamlined workflow and a unified management and monitoring experience, we started integrating the OMS portal capabilities into the Azure portal. We are happy to announce that most of the features of OMS portal are now part of the Azure portal. As a result, most customers will be able to accomplish everything you were doing in the OMS portal using the Azure portal and more. If you haven’t already done so, we recommend that you start using the Azure portal today!  

We expect to close down the remaining gaps between the two portals soon, and we plan to sunset OMS portal in the next six months. We are excited to move to the Azure portal and expect the transition to be easy. But we understand that changes are difficult and can be disruptive- If you need any help, have questions, feedback, or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at LAUpgradeFeedback@microsoft.com.  The rest of this article goes over the key scenarios, the current gaps and the roadmap for this transition.  

## What will change? 
We are planning to introduce the following changes: 

- Alert extension was already announced and is-on going (see more) 
- User role assignment in OMS Portal will be auto extended to Azure portal (see more) 
- Existing OMS Portal will be deprecated in the next six months – customers are advised to use equivalent experiences in Azure Portal (see more) 
- OMS Mobile App will be deprecated (see more)
