# Set up vRealize Operations for Azure VMware Solution (AVS)

vRealize Operations Manager is an operations management platform that allows VMware infrastructure administrators to monitor system resources. These system resources could be application-level or infrastructure level (both physical and virtual infrastructure) objects. Most VMware administrators have historically used vROps to monitor and manage the VMware Private Cloud components â€“ VCenter, ESXi, NSX-T, vSAN, and HCX. 
 
Each AVS Private Cloud is provisioned with a dedicated vCenter, NSX-T, vSAN, and HCX deployment. For customers looking to use vROps to monitor the AVS private cloud resources, we describe below the commonly used deployment options.

## Before you begin
* Review the [vRealize Operations product documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/8.1/vrealize-operations-manager-81-vapp-deploy-guide.pdf) to learn more. 
* Review the basic AVS Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC) [tutorial series](tutorial-network-checklist.md).
* Optionally, review the [vRealize Operations Remote Controller](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/8.1/com.vmware.vcom.core.doc/GUID-7F1F910F-AFB9-493C-9CBF-DEFFF5E9BB69.html) product documentation for the on-premises vRealize Operations managing AVS deployment option.
