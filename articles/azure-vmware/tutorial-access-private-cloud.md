# Tutorial: Learn how to access an Azure VMware Solution (AVS) private cloud

In this tutorial you create a Windows virtual machine in the resource group you created in the previous tutorial [Tutorial: Configure networking for your VMWare private cloud in Azure](tutorial-configure-networking.md). This is a VM on the same virtual network you created and provides access to vCenter and NSX Manager.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a Windows virtual machine to use to connect to vCenter
> * Login to vCenter from your virtual machine

## Create a new Windows virtual machine

In the resource group, select **+ Add** then search and select **Microsoft Windows 10**, and then click **Create**.

Enter the required information and then select **Review + create**.

complete the
fields as shown in the following table. Use the example values in the
table, unless the test discipline requires otherwise:

   | Field                    | Value                                                                                                                             |
   | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Subscription**         | This value is already populated with the Subscription the Resource Group belongs to.                                              |
   | **Resource group**       | This value is already populated for the current Resource Group. This should be the Resource Group you created in a previous test. |
   | **Virtual machine name** | Enter a unique name for the VM.                                                                                                   |
   | **Region**               | Select the geographical location of the VM.                                                                                       |
   | **Availability options** | Leave the default value selected.                                                                                                 |
   | **Image**                | Select the VM image.                                                                                                              |
   | **Size**                 | Leave the default size value.                                                                                                     |
   | **Authentication type**  | Select **Password**.                                                                                                              |
   | **Username**             | Enter the user name for logging on to the VM.                                                                                     |
   | **Password**             | Enter the password for logging on to the VM.                                                                                      |
   | **Confirm password**     | Enter the password for logging on to the VM.                                                                                      |
   | **Public inbound ports** | Select **None**.                                                                                                                  |

When the new VM is configured to your specifications, select **Review + create**. Once validation passes, select **Create**.

## Connect to vCenter from the Windows VM in your VNet

From the jump box log In to vSphere Client with VMware vCenter SSO. Log in to the vSphere Client using a cloud administrator user name; accept the security risk and continue when you see a warning about a potential security risk; log in to VMware vCenter with Single Sign-On credentials and verify the user interface successfully displays.

In the Azure portal, select your private cloud and then in the **Overview** view, select **Identity > Default**. The URLs and login credentials for private cloud vCenter and NSX-T manager are displayed.

![Display private cloud vCenter and NSX Manager URLs and credentials](./media/tutorial-access-private-cloud/ss4-display-identity.png)

Navigate to the virtual machine you created in the preceding step and connect to the virtual machine. For detailed steps on how to connect to the virtual machine, see [connect to a virtual machine](../virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon.md#connect-to-the-virtual-machine)

In the Windows VM, open a browser and navigate to the vCenter and NSX-T Manger URLs in two tabs. In the vCenter tab, enter the "cloudadmin@vmcp.local" user credentials from the previous step.

In the second tab of the browser, sign in to NSX-T manager.
