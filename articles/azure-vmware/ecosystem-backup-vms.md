# Backup solutions for Azure VMware Solution virtual machines

Azure VMware Solution has a broadening independent software vendor (ISV) technology ecosystem support. A key tenet of Azure VMware Solution is to leverage your investments and your favorite VMware solutions. This helps create operational consistency for admins as they continue to use VMware for resources running on Azure. Technology partners validate their solutions with Azure VMware Solution.

Commvault, Veritas, and Veeam have leading backup and restore solutions in VMware-based environments. These have been widely adopted by customers for their on-premises deployments. These technology partners now extend their backup and restore solutions to Azure VMware Solution by leveraging Azure to provide a backup repository and a storage target for long-term retention and archival. 

All backup network traffic between VMs in the Azure VMware Solution private cloud and the backup repository in Azure travels over a high bandwidth, low latency link. Replication traffic across regions travels over the internal Azure backplane network, which lowers bandwidth costs for users.
