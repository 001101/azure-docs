## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Appropriate administrative rights & permission to create a private cloud.

1. On the Basics tab, complete the fields as shown in the following
table. Use the example values in the table, unless the test discipline
requires otherwise:

   | Field                      | Value                                                                                                                                                 |
   | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Subscription**           | Request Unique ID from lab proctor                                                                                                                    |
   | **Resource group**         | Request Unique ID from lab proctor                                                                                                                    |
   | **Location**               | Request location from lab proctor                                                                                                                     |
   | **Resource name**          | Depending on the situation, suggested names include devdaily-mm-dd, platdaily-mm-dd, sredaily-mm-dd, or first-last-daily-mm-dd.                       |
   | **SKU**                    | VS36Node                                                                                                                                              |
   | **Hosts**                  | Typically, leave the value at 3, but you may use a larger cluster if there are enough hosts. Be careful not to exhaust the supply of available hosts. |
   | **vCenter admin password** | Enter cloud administrator credentials.                                                                                                                |
   | **NSX-T manager password** | Enter NSX-T administrator credentials.                                                                                                                |
   | **Address block**          | Enter an IP address block for the CIDR network in this box, such as 10.175.0.0/22. Lab proctor will provide address block.                            |
   |                            |                                                                                                                                                       |

1. Click **Review + Create**.

1. If the values appear valid, click **Create**.

1. This step takes roughly two hours and provides virtually no
indication of progress. If it does not report success within 3 hours
then troubleshooting will be required.

## Verify deployment was successful

The Azure Portal notification shows the
deployment is successful. Navigate to the Azure portal to verify your private cloud is deployed.
