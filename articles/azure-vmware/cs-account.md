# Account management overview

An account on CloudSimple is created when you create your CloudSimple service.  The account is associated with your Azure subscription where the service is located.  All users who have **owner** and **contributor** role in the subscription have access to the CloudSimple Portal.  You can find the Azure subscription ID and tenant ID associated with the CloudSimple service on the [Accounts page](https://docs.azure.cloudsimple.com/account).

## Additional alert emails

CloudSimple allows you to configure email IDs that will receive alerts related to your service.  You can also configure the email ID of your alert systems to receive alerts for automatic processing.

## CloudSimple operator access

You can control access to the CloudSimple Portal for service operations personnel.  Service operations personnel sign in to the portal when you submit a support ticket.  Service operations will fix any problems reported and the actions taken are available in audit logs.

## Users

All users who have **owner** and **contributor** role in the subscription have access to the CloudSimple Portal.  When you access the portal, the user is created on the CloudSimple account.  You can disable access to the CloudSimple Portal for specific users from the Accounts page.
