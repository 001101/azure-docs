# Submit a waitlist request for accessing the Azure NetApp Files service

Before using Azure NetApp Files, you must submit a waitlist request. After you receive an email from the Azure NetApp Files team confirming that you have been granted access to the service, you then register to use the service.

## Steps

1.	Submit a waitlist request for service access through the [Azure NetApp Files waitlist submission page](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR8cq17Xv9yVBtRCSlcD_gdVUNUpUWEpLNERIM1NOVzA5MzczQ0dQR1ZTSS4u). 

    Waitlist signup does not guarantee immediate service access. You must wait for an official confirmation email from the Azure NetApp Files team before creating any NetApp accounts.
