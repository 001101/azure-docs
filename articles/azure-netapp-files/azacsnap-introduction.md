# What is Azure Application Consistent Snapshot Tool

Azure Application Consistent Snapshot Tool (AzAcSnap) is a command-line tool that enables you to simplify data protection for third-party databases (SAP HANA) in Linux environments (for example, SUSE and RHEL).  

## Benefits of using AzAcSnap

AzAcSnap leverages the volume snapshot and replication functionalities in Azure NetApp Files and Azure Large Instance.  It provides the following benefits:

- **Application-consistent data protection**
    AzAcSnap is a centralized solution for backing up critical database files. It ensures database consistency before performing a storage volume snapshot. As a result, it ensures that the storage volume snapshot can be used for database recovery.
- **Database catalog management**
    When you use AzAcSnap with a database that has a built-in backup catalog, the records within the catalog are kept current with storage snapshots.  This capability allows a database administrator to see the backup activity.
- ***Ad-hoc* volume protection**
    This capability is helpful for non-database volumes that don't need application quiescing before taking a storage snapshot.  Examples include SAP HANA log-backup volumes or SAPTRANS volumes.
- **Cloning of storage volumes**
    This capability provides space-efficient storage volume clones for development and test purposes.
- **Support for Disaster Recovery**
    AzAcSnap leverages storage volume replication to provide options for recovering replicated application-consistent snapshots at a remote site.

AzAcSnap is a single binary.  It does not need additional agents or plug-ins to interact with the database or the storage (Azure NetApp Files via Azure Resource Manager, and Azure Large Instance via SSH).  AzAcSnap must be installed on a system that has connectivity to the database and the storage.  However, the flexibility of installation and configuration allows for either a single centralized installation or a fully distributed installation with copies installed on each database installation.

## Architecture Overview

AzAcSnap can be installed on the same host as the database (SAP HANA), or it can be installed on a centralized system.  But, there must be network connectivity to the database servers and the storage back-end (Azure Resource Manager for Azure NetApp Files or SSH for Azure Large Instance).

AzAcSnap is a lightweight application that is typically executed from an external scheduler.  On most Linux systems, this operation is `cron`, which is what the documentation will focus on.  But the scheduler could be an alternative tool as long as it can import the `azacsnap` user's shell profile.  Importing the user's environment settings ensures file paths and permissions are initialized correctly.

## Command synopsis

The general format of the commands is as follows:
`azacsnap -c [command] --[command] [sub-command] --[flag-name] [flag-value]`.


## Command options

The command options are as follows:

- **`-h`** provides extended command-line help with examples on AzAcSnap usage.
- **`-c backup`** is the primary command to execute database consistent storage snapshots for
    data (SAP HANA data volumes) & other (for example, shared, log backups, or boot) volumes.
- **`-c test --test hana`** This command tests the connection to the SAP HANA instance and is
    required to validate set up of the snapshot tools.
- **`-c test --test storage`** This command ensures `azacsnap` has been configured correctly to
    communicate with the underlying storage interface by creating a temporary storage
    snapshot on all the configured `data` volumes, and then removing them. This command should be
    run for every HANA instance on a server to ensure the snapshot tools can communicate with
    the storage so they function as expected.
- **`-c details --details snapshots`** Provides a list of basic details about the snapshots for each volume that has been configured. This command can be run on the primary server or on a server in the disaster-recovery location. The command provides the following information broken down by each volume that contains snapshots:
  - Size of total snapshots in a volume.
  - Each snapshot in that volume includes the following details:
  - Snapshot name
  - Create time
  - Size of the snapshot
  - Frequency of the snapshot
- **`-c details --details replication`** Provides basic details around the replication status from the production site to the disaster-recovery site. The command monitors to ensure replication is taking place, and it shows the size of the items that are being replicated. It also provides guidance if replication is taking too long or if the link is down.
- **`-c delete`** This command deletes a storage snapshot or a set of
    snapshots. You can use either the SAP HANA Backup ID as found in HANA Studio or the storage snapshot name. The Backup ID is only tied to the `hana` snapshots, which are created for the data and shared volumes. Otherwise, if the snapshot name is entered, it searches for all snapshots that match the entered snapshot name.
- **`-c restore --restore snaptovol`** Creates a new volume based on the latest snapshot on the target volume. This command creates a new "cloned" volume based on the configured target volume, using the latest volume snapshot as the base to create the new volume.  This command does not interrupt the storage replication from primary to secondary. Instead clones of the latest available snapshot are created at the DR site and recommended filesystem mountpoints of the cloned volumes are presented. This command should be run on the Azure Large Instance system **in the DR region** (that is, the target fail-over system).
- **`-c restore --restore revertvolume`** Reverts the target volume to a prior state based on the most recent snapshot.  Using this command as part of DR Failover into the paired DR region. This command **stops** storage replication from the primary site to the secondary site, and reverts the target DR volume(s) to their latest available snapshot on the DR volumes along with recommended filesystem mountpoints for the reverted DR volumes. This command should be run on the Azure Large Instance system **in the DR region** (that is, the target fail-over system).

    > [!NOTE] 
    > This sub-command (`--restore revertvolume`) is not available for Azure NetApp Files.

- **`azacsnap.json`** the JSON configuration file.  The name can be customized by using the `--configfile` command-line option and passing the config filename as a parameter (e.g `--configfile H80.json`)
  - Create a *new* `azacsnap.json` config using `azacsnap -c configure --configuration new` or *edit* an existing config file using  `azacsnap -c configure --configuration edit`

## Pricing

AzAcSnap is a free product (no license fee). Customers are responsible for paying the cost for the underlying components in the managed resource group.
