# Resize the capacity pool

You can change the capacity pool size in 4 TiB increments or decrements as necessary. Resizing the capacity pool changes the purchased Azure NetApp Files capacity.

1. From the Manage NetApp Account blade, identify the capacity pool that you want to resize. 
2. Right-click the capacity pool name, or click the `…` icon at the end of the capacity pool’s row, then a drop-down menu appears with the options to resize or delete the capacity pool.
