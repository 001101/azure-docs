# Tutorial: Create the Azure FXT Edge Filer cluster

After you install and initialize the FXT Edge Filer hardware nodes for your cache, use the FXT cluster software to create the cache cluster. 

This tutorial walks you through the steps configure your Edge Filer nodes as a cluster. 

In this tutorial, you will learn: 

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * What information is needed before starting to create the cluster
> * The difference between the cluster's management network, the cluster network, and the client-facing network
> * How to connect to a cluster node 
> * How to create an initial cluster using one FXT Edge Filer node

This procedure takes between 15 and 45 minutes, depending on how much research you need to do to identify IP addresses and network resources.

## Prerequisites

Complete these prerequisites before starting this tutorial:

* Install at least three FXT Edge Filer hardware systems in your data center 
* Connect appropriate power and network cables to the system  
* Power on at least one FXT Edge Filer node and [set its root password](fxt-node-password.md)

## Gather information for the cluster 

You need the following information to create the FXT Edge Filer cluster:

* Cluster name

* Administrative password to set for the cluster

* IP addresses:

  * A single IP address for cluster management, and the netmask and router to use for the management network
  * The first and last IP addresses in a contiguous range of IP addresses for cluster (node to node) communication. See [IP address distribution](#ip-address-distribution), below, for details. 
  * (Client-facing IP addresses are set after cluster creation.)

* Network infrastructure information:

  * The IP address of a DNS server for the cluster
  * The name of the DNS domain for the cluster
  * The name or IP address for the cluster NTP servers (either one server or at least three) 
  * Whether you want to enable IEEE 802.1AX-2008 link aggregation on the cluster’s interfaces
  * If you enable link aggregation, whether or not to use IEEE 802.3ad (LACP) dynamic aggregation

You can configure these network infrastructure items after you create the cluster, but it is better to do it at creation time. 

### IP address distribution

The FXT Edge Filer hybrid storage cache cluster uses IP addresses in three categories:

* Management IP: A single IP address for cluster management

  This address serves as the entry point to access the cluster configuration utilities (the web-based control panel or the XML-RPC API). This address is automatically assigned to the primary node in the cluster, and it moves automatically if the primary node changes.

  Other IP addresses can be used to access the control panel, but the management IP address is designed to provide access even if individual nodes fail over.

* Cluster Network: A range of IP addresses for cluster communication

  The cluster network is used for communication among cluster nodes and to retrieve files from the backend storage (core filers).

  **Best practice:** Allocate one IP address per physical port used for cluster communication on each FXT Edge Filer node. The cluster automatically assigns the addresses in the specified range to individual nodes.

* Client-facing network: The range of IP addresses that clients use to request and write files

  The client network addresses are used by clients to access the core filer data through the cluster. For example, an NFS client might mount one of these addresses.

  **Best practice:** Allocate one IP address per physical port used for client communication on each FXT Series node.

  The cluster distributes client-facing IP addresses across its constituent nodes as evenly as possible.

  For simplicity, many administrators configure a single DNS name with round-robin DNS (RRDNS) configuration to make it easier to distribute client requests across the address range. This setup also enables all clients to use the same mount command to access the cluster. Read [Configure DNS](fxt-configure-network.md#configure-dns-for-the-fxt-edge-filer-cluster) for more information.

The management IP address and a range of cluster network addresses must be specified to create a new cluster. Client-facing addresses are specified after cluster creation.

## Connect to the first node

You can connect to any of the installed FXT nodes and use its OS software to set up the cluster.

If you have not already done so, power on at least one of the FXT nodes for your cluster, and make sure it has a network connection and an IP address. You must set a new root password to activate the node, so follow the steps in [Set hardware passwords](fxt-node-password.md) if you have not already done so.

To check the network connection, make sure that the node’s network link LEDs are illuminated (and, if necessary, the indicators on the network switch to which it is attached). Indicator LEDs are described in [Monitor FXT Edge Server hardware status](fxt-monitor.md).

When the node boots, it will request an IP address. If it is connected to a DHCP server, it accepts the IP address provided by DHCP. (This IP address is temporary. It will change when you create the cluster.)

If it is not connected to a DHCP server or does not receive a response, the node will use Bonjour software to set a self-assigned IP address in the form 169.254.\*.\*. However, you should set a temporary static IP address on one of the node’s network cards before using it to create a cluster. Instructions are included in this legacy document; contact Microsoft Service and Support for updated information: [Appendix A: Setting a Static IP Address on an FXT Node](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/create_cluster/4_8/html/static_ip.html).

### Find the IP address

Connect to the FXT Edge Filer node to find its IP address. You can use a serial cable, direct connection to the USB and VGA ports, or connect through a KVM switch. (For port connection details see [Set initial passwords](fxt-node-password.md).)

After you connect, sign in with the username `root` and the password that you set when you booted the node for the first time.  

After signing in, you need to determine the node’s IP address.

Use the command `ifconfig` to see the addresses assigned to this system.

For example, the command `ifconfig | grep -B5 inet` searches for ports with internet addresses and gives five lines of context to show the port identifier.

Write down any IP address shown in the ifconfig report. Addresses listed with port names like e0a or e0b are good options. Do not use any IP addresses listed with e7* names, since those names are only used for IPMI ports, not regular network ports.  

## Load the cluster configuration wizard in a web browser

Enter the IP address for the node in a web browser. If the browser gives a message about the site being untrusted, proceed to the site anyway. (Individual FXT Edge Filer nodes do not have CA-provided security certificates.)

![Control panel sign-in page in browser window](media/fxt-cluster-create/unconfigured-node-gui.png)

Leave the **Username** and **Password** fields blank. Click **Login** to load the cluster creation page.

![Initial setup screen for an unconfigured node in the browser-based GUI control panel](media/fxt-cluster-create/setup-first-no-cursor.png)

## Create the cluster

The cluster configuration tool guides you through a set of screens to create the FXT Edge Filer cluster. Make sure you have the [required information](#gather-information-for-the-cluster) ready before starting. 

### Creation options

The first screen gives three options. Use the “configure a new cluster manually” option unless you have special instructions from support staff. 

![initial setup screen, showing options to update software, configure a new cluster manually, or configure a cluster from a setup file](media/fxt-cluster-create/setup-first-screen.png)

Click **I will configure the cluster manually** to load the new cluster configuration options screen.

The other options are rarely used:

* Update the system image prompts you to install new OS software before creating the cluster. (The currently installed software version is listed at the top of the screen.) You must provide the software package file - either a URL and username/password, or by uploading a file from your computer. 

* The cluster setup file option is sometimes used by Microsoft Customer Service and Support. 

## Cluster options

The next screen prompts you to configure options for the new cluster.

![Browser GUI page with configuration options at the top and many form fields to fill in to create the cluster](media/fxt-cluster-create/all-options-blank.png)

The page is divided into two main sections, **Basic Configuration** and **Networking Configuration**. The networking configuration section also has subsections: one for the **Management** network and one for the **Cluster** network.

### Basic configuration

In the top section, fill in basic information for the new cluster.

![Detail of "Basic configuration" section showing three fields (cluster name, admin password, confirm password)](media/fxt-cluster-create/basic-configuration.png) 

* **Cluster Name** - Enter a unique name for the cluster.

  The cluster name must meet these criteria:
  
  * Length of 1 to 16 characters
  * Can include letters, numbers, and the dash (-) and underscore (_) characters 
  * Must not include other punctuation or special characters
  
  You can change this name later on the **Cluster** > **General Setup** configuration page. (For more information about cluster settings, read the [Cluster Configuration Guide](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/ops_conf_index.html), which is not part of this documentation set.)

  > [!NOTE] 
  > Your cluster name is used to identify system information uploaded to support for monitoring or troubleshooting, so it's helpful to include your company name.

* **Admin password** - Set the password for the default administrative user, `admin`.
  
  You should set up individual user accounts for each person who administers the cluster, but you cannot remove the user `admin`. Log in as `admin` if you need to create additional users.
 
  You can change the password for `admin` in the **Administration** > **Users** settings page in the cluster Control Panel. For details, read the **Users** documentation in the [Cluster Configuration Guide](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/gui_users.html).

<!-- to do: update "legacy" URLs when docs are ported to Microsoft site -->

### Network configuration

The **Networking** section prompts you to specify the network infrastructure that the cluster will use. 

There are two separate networks to configure:

* The *management network* provides administrator access to the cluster for configuration and monitoring. The IP address specified here is used when connecting to the Control Panel or for SSH access. 

  Most clusters use only a single management IP address, but if you want to add interfaces you can do so after creating the cluster.

* The *cluster network* is used for communication among cluster nodes and between cluster nodes and back-end storage (core filers).

The client-facing network is configured later, after the cluster has been created.

This section also includes configuration for DNS and NTP servers that are used by both networks.

### Configure the management network

Settings in the **Management** section are for the network that provides administrator access to the cluster.

![detail of "Management" section, with fields for 5 options and a checkbox for 1Gb management network](media/fxt-cluster-create/management-network-filled.png)

* **Management IP** - Specify the IP address that you will use to access the cluster Control Panel. This address will be claimed by the cluster’s primary node, but it automatically moves to a healthy node if the original primary node becomes unavailable.

  Most clusters use only one management IP address. If you want more than one, you can add them after you create the cluster by using the  **Cluster** > **Administrative Network** settings page. Read more in the [Cluster Configuration Guide](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/gui_admin_network.html).

* **Netmask** - Specify the netmask for the management network.

* **Router** - Enter the default gateway address used by the management network.

* **VLAN tag (optional)** - If your cluster uses VLAN tags, specify the tag for the management network.

  Additional VLAN settings are configured in the **Cluster** > **VLAN** settings page. Read [Working with VLANs](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/network_overview.html#vlan-overview) and [Cluster > VLAN](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/gui_vlan.html) in the Cluster Configuration Guide to learn more.

* **MTU** - If necessary, adjust the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your cluster’s management network.

* **Use 1Gb mgmt network** - Check this box if you want to assign the two 1GbE network ports on your FXT nodes to the management network only. If you don't check this box, the management network uses the highest speed port available. 

### Configure the cluster network 

The cluster network settings apply to traffic among the cluster nodes, and between cluster nodes and core filers.

![detail of "Cluster" section, with fields to enter six values](media/fxt-cluster-create/cluster-network-filled.png)

* **First IP** and **Last IP** - Enter the IP addresses that define the range to use for internal cluster communication. The IP addresses used here must be contiguous and not assigned by DHCP.

  You can add more IP addresses after creating the cluster. Use the **Cluster** > **Cluster Networks** settings page ([Cluster Configuration Guide documentation](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/gui_cluster_networks.html#gui-cluster-networks)).

  The value in **Number of IPs in Range** is calculated and shown automatically.

* **Non-mgmt netmask (optional)** - Specify the netmask for the cluster network. 

  The system automatically suggests the netmask value that you entered for the management network; change it if needed.

* **Cluster router (optional)** - Specify the default gateway address used by the cluster network. 

  The system automatically suggests the same gateway address that you supplied for the management network.

* **Cluster VLAN tag (optional)** - If your cluster uses VLAN tags, specify the tag for the cluster network.

* **Non-mgmt MTU (optional)** - If necessary, adjust the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your cluster network.

### Configure cluster DNS and NTP 

Below the **Cluster** section there are fields for specifying DNS and NTP servers, and for enabling link aggregation. These settings apply to all networks that the cluster uses.

![Detail of section for DNS/NTP configuration, with three fields for DNS servers, fields for DNS domain and DNS search, three fields for NTP servers, and a drop-down menu for link aggregation options](media/fxt-cluster-create/dns-ntp-filled.png)

* **DNS server(s)** - Enter the IP address of one or more domain name system (DNS) servers.

  DNS is recommended for all clusters, and required if you want to use SMB, AD, or Kerberos. 
  
  For optimal performance, configure the cluster’s DNS server for round-robin load balancing as described in [Configure DNS for the FXT Edge Filer cluster](fxt-configure-network.md#configure-dns-for-the-fxt-edge-filer-cluster).

* **DNS domain** - Enter the network domain name the cluster will use.

* **DNS search** - Optionally, enter additional domain names that the system should search to resolve DNS queries. You can add up to six domain names, separated by spaces.

* **NTP server(s)** - Specify either one or three network time protocol (NTP) servers in the fields provided. You can use hostnames or IP addresses.

* **Link aggregation** - Link aggregation allows you to customize how the ethernet ports on the cluster FXT nodes handle various types of traffic. To learn more, read [Link Aggregation](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/gui_cluster_general_setup.html#link-aggregation) in the Cluster Configuration Guide.

## Create the cluster

After supplying all the required settings in the form, click the **Create Cluster** button.

![bottom of completed form with cursor over the create button at lower right](media/fxt-cluster-create/create-cluster.png)

The system displays a message while creating the cluster.

![cluster configuration status message in browser: "The FXT node is now creating the cluster. This will take several minutes. When the cluster is created, visit this link to complete the configuration." with hyperlink on "visit this link"](media/fxt-cluster-create/creating-message.png)

After a few moments, you can click the link in the message to go to the cluster Control Panel. (This link takes you to the IP address that you specified in **Management IP**.) It takes 15 seconds to one minute for the link to become active after you click the create button. If the web interface does not load, wait several more seconds and then click the link again. 

Cluster creation takes a minute or more, but you can sign in to the Control Panel while the process is going on. It is normal for the control panel's dashboard page to show warnings until the cluster creation process finishes. 

## Next steps

This tutorial creates only the basic cluster. Next, you need to add the rest of the cluster nodes, add backend storage, set up client access, and other tasks.
