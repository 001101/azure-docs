# Tutorial: Use Key Vault references in an ASP.NET Core app

In this tutorial, you learn how to use the Azure App Configuration service together with Azure Key Vault. These are complementary services which are used side by side in most application deployments.

To help you use the services together, App Configuration can create keys that reference values stored in Key Vault. When App Configuration does this, it stores the URI to the Key Vault value rather than the value itself. Your application retrieves the value of this key using the App Configuration client provider, just like it does for any other key stored in App Configuration. The client provider recognizes the key as a Key Vault reference and uses Key Vault to retrieve the value.

Your application is responsible for authenticating properly to both App Configuration and Key Vault. The two services don't communicate directly.

This tutorial shows how you can implement Key Vault references in your code. It builds on the web app introduced in the quickstarts. Before you continue, finish [Create an ASP.NET Core app with App Configuration](./quickstart-aspnet-core-app.md) first.

You can use any code editor to do the steps in this tutorial. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an excellent option that's available for the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an App Configuration key that references a value stored in Key Vault
> * Access the value of this key from an ASP.NET Core web application

## Prerequisites

To do this tutorial, install the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a vault

1. Select the **Create a resource** option in the upper left corner of the Azure portal

    ![Output after key vault creation is complete](./media/quickstarts/search-services.png)
2. Go to Search and enter **Key Vault**.
3. From the results list, select **Key Vault**.
4. In the **Key Vault** section, select **Create**.
5. In the **Create key vault** section, provide the following information:
    - **Name**: A unique name is required. For this quickstart, enter **Contoso-vault2**.
    - **Subscription**: Choose a subscription.
    - Under **Resource Group**, select **Create new** and enter a resource group name.
    - In the **Location** drop-down menu, choose a location.
    - Leave the other options with their default values.
6. After providing the preceding information, select **Create**.

At this point, your Azure account is the only one authorized to access this new vault.

## Add a secret to Key Vault

To add a secret to the vault, you just need to take a couple of additional steps. In this case, add a message that you can use to test Key Vault retrieval. The message is called **Message** and we store the value of **Hello from Key Vault** in it.

1. On the **Key Vault** properties pages, select **Secrets**.
1. Select **Generate/Import**.
1. In the **Create a secret** window, enter the following values:
    - **Name**: Enter **Message**.
    - **Value**: Enter **Hello from Key Vault**.
1. Leave the other properties with their default values.
1. Select **Create**.

## Add a Key Vault reference to App Configuration

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **All resources**, and select the app configuration store instance that you created in the quickstart.

1. Select **Configuration Explorer**.

1. Select **+ Create** > **Key vault reference**, and then enter or select the following values:
    - **Key**: Select **TestApp:Settings:KeyVaultMessage**.
    - **Label**: Leave blank.
    - **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and **Key vault**: Enter the values corresponding to those in the key vault you created in the previous section.
    - **Secret**: Select the secret named **Message** that you created in the previous section.

## Connect to Key Vault

1. In this tutorial, you use a service principal for authentication to Key Vault. To create this service principal, use the Azure CLI [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command:

    ```azurecli
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "http://mySP" --sdk-auth
    ```

    This operation will return the following series of key/value pairs:

    ```console
    {
    "clientId": "7da18cae-779c-41fc-992e-0527854c6583",
    "clientSecret": "b421b443-1669-4cd7-b5b1-394d5c945002",
    "subscriptionId": "443e30da-feca-47c4-b68f-1636b75e16b3",
    "tenantId": "35ad10f1-7799-4766-9acf-f2d946161b77",
    "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
    "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
    "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
    "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
    "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
    }
    ```

1. Run the following command to let the service principal access your key vault:

    ```
    az keyvault set-policy -n <your-unique-keyvault-name> --spn <clientId-of-your-service-principal> --secret-permissions delete get list set --key-permissions create decrypt delete encrypt get list unwrapKey wrapKey
    ```

1. Add secrets for *clientId* and *clientSecret* to Secrets Manager. These commands must be executed in the same directory as the *.csproj* file.

    ```
    dotnet user-secrets set ConnectionStrings:KeyVaultClientId <clientId-of-your-service-principal>
    dotnet user-secrets set ConnectionStrings:KeyVaultClientSecret <clientSecret-of-your-service-principal>
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> These Key Vault credentials are used only within your application. Your application authenticates directly to Key Vault with these credentials. They are never passed to the App Configuration service.

## Update your code to use a Key Vault reference

1. Open *Program.cs*, and add references to the required packages.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault;
    using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
    ```

1. Update the **CreateWebHostBuilder** method to use App Configuration by calling the **config.AddAzureAppConfiguration** method. Include the **UseAzureKeyVault** option, passing in a new **KeyVaultClient** reference to your Key Vault.

    ```csharp
    public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
            {
                var settings = config.Build();

                KeyVaultClient kvClient = new KeyVaultClient(async (authority, resource, scope) =>
                {
                    var adCredential = new ClientCredential(settings["ConnectionStrings:KeyVaultClientId"], settings["ConnectionStrings:KeyVaultClientSecret"]);
                    var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority, null);
                    return (await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource, adCredential)).AccessToken;
                });

                config.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options => {
                    options.Connect(settings["ConnectionStrings:AppConfig"])
                            .UseAzureKeyVault(kvClient); });
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
    ```

1. After you've passed the **KeyVaultClient** reference to the **UseAzureKeyVault** method when initializing the connection to App Configuration, you can access the values of Key Vault references in the same way you access the values of regular App Configuration keys. To see this process in action, open *Index.cshtml* in the **Views** > **Home** directory. Replace its content with the following code:

    ```html
    @using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
    @inject IConfiguration Configuration

    <style>
        body {
            background-color: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:BackgroundColor"]
        }
        h1 {
            color: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:FontColor"];
            font-size: @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:FontSize"];
        }
    </style>

    <h1>@Configuration["TestApp:Settings:Message"]
        and @Configuration["TestApp:Settings:KeyVaultMessage"]</h1>
    ```

    You access the value of the Key Vault reference "TestApp:Settings:KeyVaultMessage" in the same way as the configuration value for "TestApp:Settings:Message".

## Build and run the app locally

1. To build the app by using the .NET Core CLI, run the following command in the command shell:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

2. After the build is successfully completed, run the following command to run the web app locally:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

3. Open a browser window, and go to `http://localhost:5000`, which is the default URL for the web app hosted locally.
