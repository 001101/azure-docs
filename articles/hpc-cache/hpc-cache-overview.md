# What is Azure HPC Cache? 

Azure HPC Cache speeds access to your data for high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. By caching data in Azure, it makes the scalability of cloud computing available even for workflows where data is stored in on-premises hardware.

Azure HPC Cache is easy to launch and monitor from the Azure portal. Existing NFS storage or new Blob containers can become part of its aggregated namespace, with a virtual filesystem that makes client access simple, even if you change the back-end storage target.

## Use cases

Azure HPC Cache enhances productivity best for workflows like these:

* Read-heavy file access workflow 
* Data stored in NFS-accessible on-premises storage, Azure Blob, or both 
* Compute farms of 1000 to 100,000 CPU cores

It can be used with a wide variety of workflows.

### Visual effects rendering

In media and entertainment, Azure HPC Cache can speed up data access for time-critical rendering projects. Add cache instances or more Azure compute nodes for maximum flexibility in large, time-critical projects.

### Life sciences

Azure HPC Cache can let researchers run their secondary analysis workflows in Azure Compute, and access genomic data no matter their location.

### Financial services analytics

An Azure HPC Cache can help speed up quantitative analysis calculations, which gives financial services companies better insight to make strategic decisions.
