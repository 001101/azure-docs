# Configure server to use gateway for datasources on an Azure Virtual Network (VNET)

This article describes the **AlwaysUseGateway** server property for use when datasources are on an [Azure Virtual Network (VNET)](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This property is effective only when an [On-premises gateway](analysis-services-gateway.md) is installed and configured.


## Description
If your datasources are on an Azure virtual machine (VM) or on-premises accessed through a VNET, your Azure Analysis Services server must be able to connect to those datasources just like they are an on-premises datasource. 

You can configure the AlwaysUseGateway server property to specify the server to access all data through an [On-premises gateway](analysis-services-gateway.md). 

This applies whether the source system is in the cloud or not. The gateway machine can be on the VNET and the data can be accessed successfully.

With the property set to true, Azure AS will access all source data only through the GW, so this depends on having a GW set up as described here. The computer the gateway is installed on can be in the VNET.

## Configure AlwaysUseGateway property

1. In SSMS > server > **Properties** > **General**, select **Show Advanced (All) Properties**.
2. In the **ASPaaS\AlwaysUseGateway**, select **true**.
