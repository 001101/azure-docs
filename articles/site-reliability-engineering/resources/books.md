# Books for Learning About Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

For more detailed information about SRE, the best source is a trio of books that have been published on the subject

1. [_Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems_](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do) (known as "The SRE Book")
1. [_The Site Reliability Workbook: Practical Ways to Implement SRE_](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920132448.do) (known as "The SRE Workbook")
1. [_Seeking SRE: Conversations About Running Production Systems at Scale_](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920063964.do)

Each of those books provides an important set of information:

- The SRE Book - provides a detailed explanation of how Google implemented SRE over the years.

- The SRE Workbook - a companion to The SRE Book that provides a more detailed explanation of not just the “what” of SRE at Google and a few other places, but the “how” and “why”.

- Seeking SRE - provides a more expansive view of the SRE world beyond its origin including information on how it has been implemented in other environments.

Because these books describe the experience, environments and culture of organizations that may or may not resemble the one you are in, it is important to read these books with a critical eye. As you read, try to determine which practices would or would not succeed in your organization. Take some time to identify the information that you are certain can provide some positive value. Think about which parts of your organization's culture and values can support SRE work as described and which might make it more challenging. A careful, interactive embracing of SRE will almost always yield better results than a wholesale duplication of something you read in these books.
