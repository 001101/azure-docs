# Process event streams using Azure CLI

Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable data streaming platform and ingestion service capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. This quickstart shows how to send and receive events to and from an event hub, after using Azure CLI to create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub within that namespace.

If you do not have an Azure subscription, create a [free account][] before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Log on to Azure

Once CLI is installed, perform the following steps to install the Event Hubs CLI extension, and to log on to Azure:

1. Run the following command to log on to Azure:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az login
   ```

3. Set the current subscription context:

   ```azurecli
   az account set --subscription <Azure_subscription_name>
   ``` 

## Provision resources

After logging in to Azure, issue the following commands to provision Event Hubs resources. Be sure to replace the placeholders `myResourceGroup`, `namespaceName`, `eventHubName`, and `storageAccountName` with the appropriate values:

```azurecli
# Create a resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Create an Event Hubs namespace
az eventhubs namespace create --name namespaceName --resource-group myResourceGroup -l eastus2

# Create an event hub
az eventhubs eventhub create --name eventHubName --resource-group myResourceGroup --namespace-name namespaceName

# Create a general purpose standard storage account
az storage account create --name storageAccountName --resource-group myResourceGroup --location eastus2 --sku Standard_RAGRS --encryption blob

# List the storage account access keys
az storage account keys list --resource-group myResourceGroup --account-name storageAccountName

# Get namespace connection string
az eventhubs namespace authorization-rule keys list --resource-group myResourceGroup --namespace-name namespaceName --name RootManageSharedAccessKey
```

Copy and paste the connection string to a temporary location, such as Notepad, to use later.

## Stream into Event Hubs

The next step is to download the sample code that streams events to an event hub, and receives those events using the Event Processor Host. First, send the messages:

1. Clone the [Event Hubs GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs).
2. Navigate to the **Send** folder: `\azure-event-hubs\samples\Java\Basic\Send\src\main\java\com\microsoft\azure\eventhubs\samples\send`.
2. In the Send.java file, replace the `----EventHubsNamespaceName-----` value with the Event Hubs namespace you obtained in the "Create an Event Hubs namespace" section of this article.
2. Replace `----EventHubName-----` with the name of the event hub you created within that namespace.
3. Replace `-----SharedAccessSignatureKeyName-----` with the name of the Shared access policy for the namespace. Unless you created a new policy, the default is **RootManageSharedAccessKey**.
4. Replace `---SharedAccessSignatureKey----` with the value of the SAS key for the policy in the previous step.
5. To build the application, navigate to the `\azure-event-hubs\samples\Java\Basic\Send` folder, and issue the following command:

   ```shell
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

### Receive

Now download the Event Processor Host sample, which receives the messages you just sent:

1. Navigate to the **EventProcessorSample** folder: `\azure-event-hubs\samples\Java\Basic\EventProcessorSample\src\main\java\com\microsoft\azure\eventhubs\samples\eventprocessorsample`.
2. In the EventProcessorSample.java file, replace the `----EventHubsNamespaceName-----` value with the Event Hubs namespace you obtained in the "Create an Event Hubs namespace" section of this article. 
3. Replace `----EventHubName-----` with the name of the event hub you created within that namespace.
4. Replace `-----SharedAccessSignatureKeyName-----` with the name of the Shared access policy for the namespace. Unless you created a new policy, the default is **RootManageSharedAccessKey**.
5. Replace `---SharedAccessSignatureKey----` with the value of the SAS key for the policy in the previous step.
6. Replace `----AzureStorageConnectionString----` with the connection string for the storage account you created.
7. Replace `----StorageContainerName----` with the name of the container under the storage account you created.
8. Replace `----HostNamePrefix----` with the name of the storage account.
9. To build the application, navigate to the `\azure-event-hubs\samples\Java\Basic\EventProcessorSample` folder, and issue the following command:

   ```shell
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

### Run the apps

If the builds completed successfully, you are ready to send and receive events. 

1. Run the **Send** application and observe events being sent. To run the program, navigate to the `\azure-event-hubs\samples\Java\Basic\Send` folder, and issue the following command:

   ```shell
   java -jar ./target/send-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   ```
2. Run the **EventProcessorSample** app, and observe the events being received. To run the program, navigate to the `\azure-event-hubs\samples\Java\Basic\EventProcessorSample` folder, and issue the following command:
   
   ```shell
   java -jar ./target/eventprocessorsample-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   ```

After running both programs, you can check the Azure portal overview page for the event hub to see the incoming and outgoing message count:

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, namespace, storage account, and all related resources. Replace `myResourceGroup` with the name of the resource group you created:

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps
