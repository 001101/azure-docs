# Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystems

Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystems provides a Kafka endpoint that can be used by your existing Kafka based applications as an alternative to running your own Kafka cluster. Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystems supports [Apache Kafka 1.0](https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation.html) and newer client versions and works with your existing Kafka applications, including mirror maker. Simply change your connection string and start running your Kafka applications on Event Hubs.

## What does Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystems provide?

Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystems provides a protocol head on top of Azure Event Hubs that is binary compatible with Kafka versions 1.0 and later for both reading from and writing to Kafka topics. Conceptually Kafka and Event Hubs are nearly identical: they are both partitioned logs built for streaming data. The following table maps concepts between Kafka and Event Hubs.

### Kafka and Event Hub conceptual mapping

| Kafka Concept | Event Hubs Concept|
| --- | --- |
| Cluster | Namespace |
| Topic | Event Hubs |
| Partition | Partition|
| Consumer Group | Consumer Group |
| Offset | Offset|

### Key differences between Kafka and Event Hubs

While [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is software, which you can run wherever you choose, Event Hubs is a cloud service similar to Azure Blob Storage. There are no servers or networks to manage and no brokers to configure. You create a Namespace, which is an FQDN for your topics to live in and then create Event Hubs or Topics within that Namespace. For more information about Event Hubs and Namespaces, see [What is Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs. As a cloud service Event Hubs uses a single stable virtual IP address as the endpoint, so clients do not need to know about the brokers or machines within a cluster. 

Scale in Event Hubs is controlled by how many Throughput Units you purchase, with each Throughput Unit entitling you to 1 MBps or 1000 events per second of ingress. By default Event Hubs will scale up Throughput Units when you hit your limit with the [Auto-Inflate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-auto-inflate) feature; this feature also works with Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystems. 

### Security and Authentication

Azure Event Hubs requires SSL or TLS for all communication and uses Share Access Signatures for security. This is also true for the Kafka endpoint within Event Hubs. For compatibility with Kafka, Event Hubs uses SASL PLAIN for authentication and SASL SSL for transport security. For more information about security in Event Hubs see [Event Hubs authentication and security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-authentication-and-security-model-overview).

## Other Event Hubs features available for Kafka

Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystems allows you to write with one protocol and read with another, so your current Kafka producers can continue publishing via Kafka and you can add readers with Event Hubs like Azure Stream Analytics or Azure Functions. Additionally Event Hubs features like [Capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-capture-overview) and [Geo Disaster-Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-geo-dr) also work with Event Hubs for Kafka Ecosystems.
