# Process events using PowerShell and .NET Standard

In this quickstart, we'll show you how to:
* Create an event hub using PowerShell
* Send to and receive from an event hub using our .NET Standard SDK. 

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, make sure you have:

1. An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, [create a free subscription][] before you begin.
2. [Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (version 15.3, 26730.01)](http://www.visualstudio.com/vs) or later.
3. [.NET Standard SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows), version 2.0 or later.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you're using PowerShell locally, you must be running the latest version of PowerShell in order to complete this article. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install and Configure Azure PowerShell][].

## Log on to Azure

Once PowerShell is installed, perform the following steps to install the Event Hubs PowerShell module and log on to Azure:

1. To install the Event Hubs PowerShell module, run:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Install-Module AzureRM.EventHub
   ```

2. To log on to Azure, run:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Login-AzureRmAccount
   ```

3. Change to the current subscription or see the currently active subscription. Replace `MyAzureSub` with the name of the Azure subscription you want to use:

   ```azurepowershell
   Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "MyAzureSub"
   Get-AzureRmContext
   ```

## Provision resources

### Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical collection of Azure resources. All resources are deployed, managed into a resource group.
The following example creates a resource group named eventhubsResourceGroup in the East US region

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroup –Name eventhubsResourceGroup –Location east
```

### Create an Event Hubs namespace

An Event Hubs namespace provides a unique fully qualified domain name in which you can create your event hub. The following example creates a namespace in your resource group. Replace <namespace_name> with a unique name for your namespace.


```powershell
New-AzureRmEventHubNamespace -ResourceGroupName eventhubsResourceGroup  -NamespaceName <namespace_name> -Location eastus
```

### Create an event hub
To create an event hub, specify the namespace under which you want it created. The following example shows how to create an event hub


```powershell
  New-AzureRmEventHub -ResourceGroupName eventhubsResourceGroup   -NamespaceName <eventhubs_namespace_name> -EventHubName <eventhub_name> -Location eastus 
```

### Create a storage account for Event Processor Host

Event Processor Host is an intelligent agent that simplifies receiving events from Event Hubs by managing persistent checkpoints and parallel receives. For checkpointing, Event Processor Host requires a storage account. To create a storage account and get its keys, run:

```powershell
# create a standard general-purpose storage account 
New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName eventhubsResourceGroup   
  -Name <storage_account_name>
  -Location eastus
  -SkuName Standard_LRS 

# retrieve the storage account key for accessing it
Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $storageAccountName).Value[0]

```

### Get the connection string

A connection string is required to connect to your event hub and process events. To obtain the connection string, run:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmEventHubKey -ResourceGroupName eventhubsResourceGroup -NamespaceName <namespace_name> -EventHubName <eventhub_name> -Name RootManageSharedAccessKey
```

## Stream into Event Hubs

You can now start streaming into your Event Hubs. The samples can be downloaded or Git cloned from the [Event Hubs repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs)

### Ingest events

1. Download the [SampleSender](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples/DotNet/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs/SampleSender) from GitHub, or clone the [azure-event-hubs repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs).

2. Navigate to \azure-event-hubs\samples\DotNet\Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs\SampleSender folder.

3. Load SampleSender.sln file from your downloaded location in Visual Studio.

4. Add [Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs/) Nuget package to the project.

5. In Program.cs, replace the following place holders with the resource names and connection strings you have obtained while provisioning the resources:

  ```C#
  private const string EhConnectionString = "Event Hubs connection string";
  private const string EhEntityPath = "Event Hub name";

  ```
6. Build and run the sample. You can see the events being ingested into your event hub.

### Receive and process events

1. Download the [SampleEphReceiver](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples/DotNet/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs/SampleEphReceiver) from GitHub, or clone the [azure-event-hubs repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs).

2. Navigate to the \azure-event-hubs\samples\DotNet\Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs\SampleEphReceiver folder.

3. Load the SampleEphReceiver.sln solution file into Visual Studio.

4. Add the [Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs/) and [Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor/) Nuget packages to the project.

5. In Program.cs, replace the following constants with the corresponding values for the Event Hubs connection string, event hub name, storage account container name, storage account name and, storage account key:

  ```C#
  private const string EventHubConnectionString = "Event Hubs connection string";
  private const string EventHubName = "Event Hub name";
  private const string StorageContainerName = "Storage account container name";
  private const string StorageAccountName = "Storage account name";
  private const string StorageAccountKey = "Storage account key";

  ```
6. Build and run the sample. You can see the events being received on your sample application

    ![][4]

You can view the incoming and outgoing events count in the portal for the Event Hubs namespace as shown below:

   ![][5]

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, namespace, storage account, and all related resources. Replace `myResourceGroup` with the name of the resource group you created:

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```
