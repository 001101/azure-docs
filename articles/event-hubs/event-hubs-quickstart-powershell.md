# Process event streams using PowerShell and .NET

Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable data streaming platform and ingestion service capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. This quickstart shows how to use PowerShell to deploy resources, and use sample clients to ingest and process events into Event Hubs. 

If you do not have an Azure subscription, start by creating a [free account][].

This article requires that you are running the latest version of Azure PowerShell. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install and Configure Azure PowerShell][].

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Log in to Azure

Log in to your Azure subscription with the **Login-AzureRmAccount** cmdlet and follow the on-screen directions.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

## Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical collection of Azure resources. All resources are deployed and managed in a resource group.

You create a new resource group with the **[New-AzureRmResourceGroup][]**Â cmdlet. The following example creates a resource group named `eventhubsResourceGroup` in the **East US** region:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name eventhubsResourceGroup -Location eastus
```

## Create an Event Hubs namespace

An Event Hubs namespace provides a unique scoping container, referenced by its [fully qualified domain name][], in which you create one or more event hubs. The following example creates a namespace in your resource group. Replace `<namespace_name>` with a unique name for your namespace:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmEventHubNamespace -ResourceGroupName eventhubsResourceGroup -NamespaceName <namespace_name> -Location eastus
```

## Get namespace credentials

To obtain the connection string, which contains the credentials you need to connect to the event hub, run the following cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzureRmEventHubKey -ResourceGroupName eventhubsResourceGroup -NamespaceName <namespace_name> -EventHubName <eventhub_name> -Name RootManageSharedAccessKey
```

## Create an event hub

To create an event hub, specify the namespace in which you want to create it. The following example shows how to create an event hub:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmEventHub -ResourceGroupName eventhubsResourceGroup -NamespaceName <namespace_name> -EventHubName <eventhub_name> -Location eastus
```

## Create a storage account for Event Processor Host

The Event Processor Host is an intelligent agent that simplifies receiving events from Event Hubs by managing persistent checkpoints and parallel receives. For checkpointing, the Event Processor Host requires a storage account. The following example shows how to create a storage account and how to get its keys for access.

```azurepowershell-interactive

# create a standard general-purpose storage account
New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName eventhubsResourceGroup -Name <storage_account_name> -Location eastus -SkuName Standard_LRS

# retrieve the first storage account key and display it
$storageAccountKey = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $storageAccountName).Value[0]

Write-Host "storage account key 1 = " $storageAccountKey
```

## Stream into Event Hubs

The next step is to run the sample code that streams events to an event hub, and receives those events using the Event Processor Host. 

First, download the [SampleSender](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples/DotNet/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs/SampleSender) and [SampleEphReceiver](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs/tree/master/samples/DotNet/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs/SampleEphReceiver) samples from GitHub, or clone the [azure-event-hubs repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs).

## Stream events

1. Open Visual Studio, then from the **File** menu, click **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.

2. Locate the **SampleSender** sample folder you downloaded previously, then double-click the SampleSender.sln file to load the project in Visual Studio.

3. In Solution Explorer, double-click Program.cs to open the file in the Visual Studio editor.

4. Replace the `EventHubConnectionString` value with the connection string you obtained in the "Get namespace credentials" section of this article.

5. Replace `EventHubName` with the name of the event hub you created within that namespace.

6. From the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution** to ensure there are no errors.

## Receive and process events

1. Open Visual Studio, then from the **File** menu, click **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.

2. Locate the **SampleEphReceiver** sample folder you downloaded in step 1, then double-click the SampleEphReceiver.sln file to load the project in Visual Studio.

3. In Solution Explorer, double-click Program.cs to open the file in the Visual Studio editor.

4. Replace the following variable values:
	1. `EventHubConnectionString`: Replace with the connection string you obtained when you created the namespace.
	2. `EventHubName`: The name of the event hub you created within that namespace.
	3. `StorageContainerName`: The name of a storage container. Give it a unique name, and the container is created for you when you run the app.
	4. `StorageAccountName`: The name of the storage account you created.
	5. `StorageAccountKey`: The storage account key you obtained from the Azure portal.

5. From the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution** to ensure there are no errors.

## Run the apps

First, run the **SampleSender** application and observe 100 messages being sent. Press **Enter** to end the program.

![][3]

Then, run the **SampleEphReceiver** app, and observe the messages being received into the Event Processor Host.

![][4]

You can view the incoming and outgoing message count in the portal metrics window for the Event Hubs namespace. The following example shows these results after running the programs twice (sending and receiving two sets of 100 messages):

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, namespace, storage account, and all related resources

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name eventhubsResourceGroup
```
