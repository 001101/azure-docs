# Event replication and cross-region federation

Many sophisticated solutions require the same event streams to be made available for consumption in multiple locations and/or event streams to be collected in multiple locations and then consolidated into a specific locations for consumption.

Practically, that means your solution will maintain multiple Event Hubs in different regions or namespaces and replicate events between them, and/or that you will exchange events with sources and targets like [Azure Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md), [Azure IoT Hub](../iot-fundamentals/iot-introduction.md), or [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org). 

Maintaining multiple active Event Hubs in different regions also allows clients to choose and switch between them. 

## Federation Patterns

There are numerous potential motivations for why you may want to move events between different Event Hubs or other sources and targets, and we enumerate the most important patterns in this section:

### Resiliency against regional availability events 

![Regional Availability](media/event-hubs-federation-overview/regional-availability.jpg)

While maximum availability and reliability are the top operational priorities for Event Hubs, there are nevertheless a lot of ways in which a producer or consumer might be prevented from talking to its assigned "primary" Event Hub due to networking or name resolution issues, or where an Event Hub might indeed be temporarily unresponsive or returning errors. Such conditions are generally not "disastrous" such that you will want to abandon the regional deployment altogether as you might do in a disaster recovery situation, but the business scenario of some applications might already be impacted by availability events that last not more than a few minutes or even seconds. 

### Latency optimization 

![Latency Optimization](media/event-hubs-federation-overview/latency-optimization.jpg)  

Event streams are written once by producers, but may be read any number of times by event consumers. For scenarios where an event stream in a region is shared by multiple consumers, and needs to be accessed repeatedly during analytics processing residing in a different region, or with throughout demands that would starve out concurrent consumers, it may be beneficial to place a copy of the event stream near the analytics processor in order to reduce the roundtrip latency. 

### Validation, reduction, and enrichment

![Validation, reduction, enrichment](media/event-hubs-federation-overview/validation-enrichment.jpg)  

Event streams may be submitted into an Event Hub by clients external to your own solution. Such event streams may require for externally submitted events to be checked for compliance with a given schema, and for non-compliant events to be dropped. Some events may have to be reduced in complexity by omitting data and some may have to be enriched by adding data based on reference data lookups. 


### Integration with analytics services

![Integration](media/event-hubs-federation-overview/integration.jpg)

Several of Azure's cloud-native analytics services like Azure Stream Analytics or Azure Synapse work best with streamed or pre-batched data served up from Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Event Hubs also enables integration with several open-source analytics packages such as Apache Samza, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Apache Storm. Federation integration also makes data flows otherwise routed in Azure Service Bus available for analytics processing with these services and packages. 

### Consolidation and normalization of event streams

![Consolidation](media/event-hubs-federation-overview/consolidation.jpg)

Global solutions are often composed of regional footprints that are largely independent including having their own analytics capabilities, but supra-regional and global analytics perspectives will require an integrated perspective and therefore a central consolidation of the same event streams that are evaluated in the respective regional footprints for the local perspective. 

Normalization is a flavor of the consolidation scenario, whereby two or more incoming event streams carry the same kind of events, but with different structures or different encodings, and the events most be transcoded or transformed before they can be consumed. 

Normalization may also include cryptographic work such as decrypting end-to-end encrypted payloads and re-encrypting it with different keys and algorithms for the downstream consumer audience. 

### Splitting and routing of event streams

![Splitting](media/event-hubs-federation-overview/splitting.jpg)

Azure Event Hubs is occasionally used in "publish-subscribe" style scenarios where an incoming torrent of ingested events far exceeds the capacity of Azure Service Bus or Azure Event Grid, both of which have native publish-subscribe filtering and distribution capabilities and are generally preferred for this pattern. 

While a true "publish-subscribe" capability leaves it to subscribers to pick the events they want, the splitting pattern has the producer map events to partitions by a predetermined distribution model and designated consumers then exclusively pull from "their" partition. With the Event Hub buffering the overall traffic, the content of a particular partition, representing a fraction of he original throughput volume, may then be replicated into a queue for reliable, transactional, competing consumer consumption.

Many scenarios where Event Hubs is primarily used for moving events within an application within a region have some cases where select events, maybe just from a single partition, also have to be made available elsewhere. This is similar to the splitting scenario, but might use a scalable router that considers all the messages arriving in an Event Hub and cherry-picks just a few for onward routing and might differentiate routing targets by event metadata or content. 

## Event and message replication tasks

For many of the federation patterns explained above, events are copied without changes, but you will occasionally also need to create and run custom transcoding and/or transformation tasks.

Plain copies aside, replication task mights perform one or a combination of actions on events  before forwarding, for instance:

- *Transcoding* - If the event content (also referred to as "body" or "payload") arrives from the source encoded using the Apache Avro format or some proprietary serialization format, but the expectation of the system owning the target is for the content to be JSON encoded, a transcoding replication task will first deserialize the payload from Apache Avro into an in-memory object graph and then serialize that graph into the JSON format for the event that is being forwarded. Transcoding also includes content compression and decompression tasks.
- *Transformation* - Events that contain structured data may require reshaping of that data for easier consumption by downstream consumers. This may involve work like flattening nested structures, pruning extraneous data elements, or reshaping the payload to exactly fit a given schema.
- *Batching* - Events may be received in batches (multiple events in a single transfer) from a source, but have to be forwarded singly to a target, or vice versa. A task may therefore forward multiple events based on a single input event transfer or aggregate a set of events that are then transferred together. 
- *Validation* - Event data from external sources often need to be checked for whether they are in compliance with a set of rules before they may be forwarded. The rules may be expressed using schemas or code. Events that are found not to be in compliance may be dropped, with the issue noted in logs, or may be forwarded to a special target destination to handle them further.   
- *Enrichment* - Event data coming from some sources may require enrichment with further context for it to be usable in target systems. This may involve looking up reference data and embedding that data with the event, or adding information about the source that is known to the replication task, but not contained in the events. 
- *Filtering* - Some events arriving from a source might have to be withheld from the target based on some rule. A filter tests the event against a rule and drops the event if the event does not match the rule. Filtering out duplicate events by observing certain criteria and dropping subsequent events with the same values is a form of filtering.
- *Routing and Partitioning* - Some replication tasks may allow for two or more alternative targets, and define rules for which replication target is chosen for any particular event based on the metadata or content of the event. A special form of routing is partitioning, where the task explicitly assigns partitions in one replication target based on rules.
- *Cryptography* - A replication task may have to decrypt content arriving from the source and/or encrypt content forwarded onwards to a target, and/or it may have to verify the integrity of content and metadata relative to a signature carried in the event, or attach such a signature. 
- *Attestation* - A replication task may attach metadata, potentially protected by a digital signature, to an event that attests that the event has been received through a specific channel or at a specific time.     
- *Chaining* - A replication task may apply signatures to sequences of events such that the integrity of the sequence is protected and missing events can be detected.

### Replication applications in Azure Functions

Implementing the patterns above requires a scalable and reliable execution environment for the replication tasks that you want to configure and run. On Azure, the runtime environment that is best suited for these tasks is [Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md). 

Azure Functions can run under a [Azure managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) such that the replication tasks can integrate with the role-based access control rules of the source and target services without you having to manage secrets along the replication path. For replication sources and targets that require explicit credentials, Azure Functions can hold the configuration values for those credentials in tightly access-controlled storage inside of [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md).

Azure Functions furthermore allows the replication tasks to directly integrate with Azure virtual networks and [service endpoints](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md) for all Azure messaging services, and it is readily integrated with [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md).

Most importantly, Azure Functions has prebuilt, scalable triggers and output bindings for [Azure Event Hubs](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-hubs.md), [Azure IoT Hub](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-iot), [Azure Service Bus](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-service-bus.md), [Azure Event Grid](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-grid.md), and [Azure Queue Storage](/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-queue.md), as well as custom extensions for [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension), and [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-kafka-extension). Most triggers will dynamically adapt to the throughput needs by scaling the number of concurrently executing instance up and down based on documented metrics. 

With the Azure Functions consumption plan, the prebuilt triggers can even scale down to zero while no messages are available for replication, which means you incur no costs for keeping the configuration ready to scale back up; the key downside of using the consumption plan is that the latency for replication tasks "waking up" from this state is significantly higher than with the hosting plans where the infrastructure is kept running.  

In contrast to all of this, most common replication engines for messaging and eventing, such as Apache Kafka's [MirrorMaker](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_mirror_maker) require you to provide a hosting environment and manage scaling the replication engine yourself. That includes configuring and integrating the security and networking features and facilitating the flow of monitoring data, and then you usually still don't have an opportunity to inject custom replication tasks into the flow.
