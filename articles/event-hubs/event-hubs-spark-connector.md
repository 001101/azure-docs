# Integrating Apache Spark with Azure Event Hubs

To enable building _end-to-end_ distributed streaming applications easy for users, Azure Event Hubs seamlessly integrates with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). This integration supports [Spark Core](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark#Spark_Core), [Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/streaming/), [Structured Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html). The Event Hubs Connector for Apache Spark which enables this integration is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-spark). This library is also available for use in Maven projects from the [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.microsoft.azure%7Cazure-eventhubs-spark_2.11%7C2.1.6%7C)

This article will show you how to make a continuous application in [Azure Databrick](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/databricks/). This article uses Azure Databricks, Spark Clusters are also available with [HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-overview)

In the example below you will set up two Scala notebooks, one for streaming events from an Event Hub and other for sending messages to it.

## Prerequisites

1. An Azure subscription. If you do not have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio)
2. An Event Hubs instance. If you do not have one, [create one](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create)
3. An Azure Databricks instance. If you do not have one, [create one](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-databricks/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal)
4. [Create a library using maven coordinate:'com.microsoft.azure:azure‐eventhubs‐spark_2.11:2.3.0'](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/07/28/using-3rd-party-libraries-in-databricks-apache-spark-packages-and-maven-libraries.html)

Use the following code snippet in your notebook to stream event from the Event Hub

```java
import org.apache.spark.eventhubs._

// To connect to an Event Hub, EntityPath is required as part of the connection string.
// Here, we assume that the connection string from the Azure portal does not have the EntityPath part.
val connectionString = ConnectionStringBuilder("{EVENT HUB CONNECTION STRING FROM AZURE PORTAL}")
  .setEventHubName("{EVENT HUB NAME}")
  .build 
val ehConf = EventHubsConf(connectionString)
  .setStartingPosition(EventPosition.fromEndOfStream)

// Create a stream that reads data from the specified Event Hub.
val reader = spark.readStream
  .format("eventhubs")
  .options(ehConf.toMap)
  .load()

// Select the body column and cast it to a string.
val eventhubs = reader.load()
  .select("body")
  .as[String]

```
Use the following code snippet in your application to send events your Event Hub using the Spark's batch API. You can also write streaming query to send messages to the Event Hub.

```java
import org.apache.spark.eventhubs._
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

// To connect to an Event Hub, EntityPath is required as part of the connection string.
// Here, we assume that the connection string from the Azure portal does not have the EntityPath part.
val connectionString = ConnectionStringBuilder("{EVENT HUB CONNECTION STRING FROM AZURE PORTAL}")
  .setEventHubName("{EVENT HUB NAME}")
  .build

val eventHubsConf = EventHubsConf(connectionString)

// Create a column representing the partitionKey.
val partitionKeyColumn = (col("id") % 5).cast("string").as("partitionKey")
// Create random strings as the body of the message.
val bodyColumn = concat(lit("random nunmber: "), rand()).as("body")

// Write 200 rows to the specified Event Hub.
val df = spark.range(200).select(partitionKeyColumn, bodyColumn)
df.write
  .format("eventhubs")
  .options(eventHubsConf.toMap)
  .save() 

```
