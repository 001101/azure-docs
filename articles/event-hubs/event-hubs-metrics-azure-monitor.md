# Azure Event Hubs metrics in Azure Monitor (preview)

Event Hubs metrics gives you the state of Event Hubs resources in your Azure subscription. With a rich set of metrics data, you can assess the overall health of your event hubs not only at the namespace level, but also at the entity level. These statistics can be important as they help you to monitor the state of your event hubs. Metrics can also help troubleshoot root-cause issues without needing to contact Azure support.

Azure Monitor provides unified user interfaces for monitoring across various Azure services. For more information, see [Monitoring in Microsoft Azure](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview.md).

## Access metrics

Azure Monitor provides multiple ways to access metrics. You can either access metrics through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), or use the Azure Monitor APIs (REST and .NET) and analysis solutions such as Operation Management Suite and Event Hubs. For more information, see [Azure Monitor metrics](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metric.md).

Metrics are enabled by default, and you can access the most recent 30 days of data. If you need to retain data for a longer period of time, you can archive metrics data to an Azure Storage account. This is configured in [diagnostic settings](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-of-diagnostic-logs.md#resource-diagnostic-settings) in Azure Monitor.

## Access metrics in the portal

You can monitor metrics over time in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). The following example shows how to view successful requests and incoming requests at the account level:

For metrics supporting dimensions, you must filter with the desired dimension value as shown in the following example:

## Billing

Using metrics in Azure Monitor is currently free while in preview. However, if you use additional solutions that ingest metrics data, you may be billed by these solutions. For example, you are billed by Azure Storage if you archive metrics data to an Azure Storage account. You are also billed by Operation Management Suite (OMS) if you stream metrics data to OMS for advanced analysis.

The following metrics give you an overview of the health of your service. 

> [!NOTE]
> We are deprecating several metrics as they are moved under a different name. This might require you to update your references. Metrics marked with the "deprecated" keyword will not be supported going forward.

All metrics values are sent to Azure Monitor every minute. The time granularity defines the time interval for which metrics values are presented. The supported time interval for all Event Hubs metrics is 1 minute.
