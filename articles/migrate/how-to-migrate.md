# Migrate servers to Azure

This article describes how to migrate servers to Azure using [Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md).

## Before you start

Make sure you've [created an Azure Migrate project](how-to-create-project.md).

## Select a migration tool

1. In Azure Migrate > **Overview**, click **Assess and Migrate Servers**.
2. In **Azure Migrate - Servers**, next to **Add more migration tools**, click **Click here**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you need to navigate to a different project, in **Azure Migrate - Servers**, next to **See details for a different migrate project**, click **Click here**.

3. In **Azure Migrate**, select the migration tool you want to use.
    - If you use Azure Migrate Server Migration, you can set up and run migrations directly in the Azure Migrate project.
    - If you use a third-party assessment tool, you should navigate to the link provided for their site, and run the migration in accordance with the instructions they provide.
