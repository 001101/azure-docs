# Select migration tools

This article describes how to add migration tools in the [Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) hub. 

Azure Migrate provides a hub of tools for assessment and migration to Azure. It includes native tools, tools provided by other Azure services, and third-party independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.

If you want to add a migration tool and you don't yet have an Azure Migrate project, follow this [article](how-to-add-tool-first-time.md).



## Select a  tool

1. In Azure Migrate > **Overview**, click **Assess and Migrate Servers**.
2. In **Azure Migrate - Servers**, next to **Add more migration tools**, click **Click here**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you need to navigate to a different project, in **Azure Migrate - Servers**, next to **See details for a different migrate project**, click **Click here**.

3. In **Azure Migrate**, select the migration tool you want to use.
    - If you use Azure Migrate Server Migration, you can set up and run migrations directly in the Azure Migrate project.
    - If you use a third-party assessment tool, you should navigate to the link provided for their site, and run the migration in accordance with the instructions they provide.

## Next steps

Try out an Azure Migrate Server Migration for [Hyper-V](tutorial-migrate-hyper-v.md) or [VMware](tutorial-migrate-vmware.md) VMs.
