# Create a group for assessment

This article describes how to create a group of machines for assessment by [Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md). Azure Migrate assesses each machine in the group to check whether it's suitable for migration to Azure, and provides sizing and cost estimations for running the machine in Azure.


## Create a group

1. In the **Dashboard** of the Azure Migrate project, click **Groups** > **+Group**, and specify a group name.
2. Add one or more machines to the group, and click **Create**. 
3. After the group is created, you can modify it by adding and removing machines.
4. Select **Create a new assessment**, to run an assessment for the group.
