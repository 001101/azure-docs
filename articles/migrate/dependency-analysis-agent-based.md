# Agent-based dependency analysis

This article describes agent-based dependency analysis in Azure Migrate:Server Assessment. Dependency analysis helps you to identify dependencies between on-premises machines that you want to assess and migrate to Azure. [Learn](concepts-dependency-visualization.md) about dependency analysis, and [compare](concepts-dependency-visualization.md#compare-agentless-and-agent-based) agent-based analysis with agentless.






## Next steps
- [Set up](how-to-create-group-machine-dependencies.md) agent-based dependency analysis.
- Review [common questions](common-questions-discovery-assessment.md#what-is-dependency-visualization) about dependency visualization.
