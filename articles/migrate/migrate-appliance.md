# Azure Migrate appliance

This article describes the Azure Migrate appliance. You deploy the appliance when you use Azure Migrate Assessment and Migration tools to discover, assess and migrate apps, infrastructure, and workloads to Microsoft Azure. 

These tools are available in The [Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) hub. The hub provides native tools for assessment and migration, as well as tools from other Azure services, and from third-party independent software vendors (ISVs).



## Appliance overview

The Azure Migrate appliance types and usage are as follows.

**Deployed as** | **Used for** | **Details**
--- | --- |  ---
VMware VM | VMware VM assessment with the Azure Migrate Assessment tool. | Download OVA template and import to vCenter Server to create the appliance VM.
VMware VM | VMware VM migration when doing agentless migration with the Azure Migrate Migration tool. | Download OVA template and import to vCenter Server to create the appliance VM.
Hyper-V VM | Hyper-V VM assessment with the Azure Migrate Assessment tool. | Download zipped VHD and import to Hyper-V to create the appliance VM.

## Appliance access

After you have configured the appliance, you can remotely access the appliance VM through TCP port 3389. You can also remotely access the web management app for the appliance, on port 44368 with URL: https://<appliance-ip-or-name>:44368.

## Appliance license
The appliance comes with a Windows Server 2016 evaluation license, which is valid for 180 days. If the evaluation period is close to expiry, we recommend that you download and deploy a new appliance, or that you activate the operating system license of the appliance VM.

## Appliance agents
The appliance has these agents installed.

**Agent** | **Details**
--- | ---
Discovery agent | Collects VM configuration metadata
Assessment agent | Collects VM performance data
Migration adapter | Orchestrates VM replication, and coordinates communication between VMs and Azure.
Migration gateway | Sends replicated VM data to Azure.


## Appliance deployment requirements

- [Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md#assessment-appliance-requirements) the deployment requirements for a VMware appliance, and the URLs that the appliance needs to access.
- [Review](migrate-support-matrix-hyper-v.md#assessment-appliance-requirements) the deployment requirements for a Hyper-V appliance, and the URLs that the appliance  needs to access.


## Collected data

Here's what the appliance collects and sends to Azure.

### VMware VM data

**Action** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Collected metadata** | vCenter VM name<br/> vCenter VM path (host/cluster/folder)<br/> IP and MAC addresses<br/> Operating system<br/> Number of cores/disks/NICs<br/> Memory and disk size.
**Collected performance data** | CPU and memory usage<br/> Data for each disk (disk read/write throughput; disk reads/writes per second)<br/> Data for each NIC (network in, network out).<br/><br/> Performance data is collected continually after the appliance connects to vCenter Server. Historical data isn't collected.

### Hyper-V VM data

**Action** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Collected metadata** | VM name<br/> VM path <br/> IP and MAC addresses<br/> Operating system<br/> Number of cores/disks/NICs<br/> Memory and disk size.
**Collected performance data** |  CPU and memory usage<br/> Data for each disk (disk read/write throughput; disk reads/writes per second)<br/> Data for each NIC (network in, network out).<br/><br/> Performance data is collected continually after the appliance connects to the Hyper-V host. Historical data isn't collected.

## Discovery and collection process

The appliance communicates with vCenter Servers and Hyper-V hosts/cluster using the following process.


1. **Start discovery**:
    - When you start the discovery on the Hyper-V appliance, it communicates with the Hyper-V hosts on WinRM ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS).
    - When you start discovery on the VMware appliance, it communicates with the vCenter server on TCP port 443 by default. IF the vCenter server listens on a different port, you can configure it in the appliance web app.
2. **Gather metadata and performance data**:
    - The appliance uses a Common Information Model (CIM) session to gather Hyper-V VM data from the Hyper-V host on ports 5985 and 5986.
    - The appliance communicates with port 443 by default, to gather VMware VM data from the vCenter Server.
3. **Send data**: The appliance sends the collected data to Azure Migrate Server Assessment and Azure Migrate Server Migration over SSL port 443.
    - For performance data, the appliance collects real-time utilization data.
        - Performance data is collected every 20 seconds for VMware, and every 30 seconds for Hyper-V, for each performance metric.
        - The collected data is rolled up to create a single data point for ten minutes.
        - The peak utilization value is selected from all of the 20/30 second data points, and sent to Azure for assessment calculation.
        - Based on the percentile value specified in the assessment properties (50th/90th/95th/99th), the ten-minute points are sorted in ascending order, and the appropriate percentile value is used to compute the assessment
    - For Server Migration, the appliance starts collecting VM data, and replicates it to Azure.
4. **Assess and migrate**: You can now create assessments from the metadata collected by the appliance using Azure Migrate Server Assessment. In addition, you can also start migrating VMware VMs using Azure Migrate Server Migration to orchestrate agentless VM replication.


## Appliance upgrades

The appliance is upgraded as the Azure Migrate agents running on the appliance are updated.

- This happens automatically because the auto-update is enabled on the appliance by default.
- You can change this default setting to update the agents manually. 

### Set agent updates to manual

For manual updates, make sure that you update all the agents on the appliance at the same time, using the **Update** button for each outdated agent on the appliance. You can switch the update setting back to automatic updates at any time.
