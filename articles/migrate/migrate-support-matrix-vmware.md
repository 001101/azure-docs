# Support matrix for VMware assessment and migration

You can use the [Azure Migrate service](migrate-overview.md) to assess and migrate machines to the Microsoft Azure cloud. This article summarizes general support settings and limitations for assessing and migrating on-premises VMware VMs.

## Azure Migrate versions

There are two versions of the Azure Migrate service:

- **Current version**: This version should be used for all new Azure Migrate projects, assessments, and migrations. [Learn more](whats-new.md#azure-migrate-new-version) about the new features in this version.
- **Previous version**: The previous version of Azure Migrate only provided assessment of on-premises VMware VMs for migration to Azure. You can't create new Azure Migrate projects in this version.


The support information in this article refers to the current Azure Migrate version.

## Supported migration scenarios

The table summarizes supported migration scenarios.

**Deployment** | **Details*** 
--- | --- 
**Assess on-premises VMware VMs** | [Set up](tutorial-prepare-vmware.md) your first assessment.<br/><br/> [Run](scale-vmware-assessment.md) a large-scale assessment.
**Migrate VMware VMs** **| You can migrate using agentless migration, with some limitations, or use an agent-based migration. [Learn more](server-migrate-overview.md)
**Assess and migrate on-premises Hyper-V VMs** | [Set up](tutorial-prepare-hyper-v.md) your first assessment.<br/><br/> [Run](scale-hyper-v-assessment.md) a large-scale assessment.<br/> [Try out](tutorial-migrate-hyper-v.md) migration to Azure.

## VMware VM agentless migration

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Supported operating system** | ll [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2721672/microsoft-server-software-support-for-microsoft-azure-virtual-machines) and [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros) operating systems that are supported by Azure can be migrated using agentless migration.
**Required changes for Azure** | Some VMs might require changes so that they can run in Azure. Azure Migrate makes these changes automatically for the following operating systems:<br/> - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5+, 7.0+<br/> - CentOS 6.5+, 7.0+</br> - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1+<br/> - Ubuntu 14.04LTS, 16.04LTS, 18.04LTS<br/> - Debian 7,8<br/><br/> For other operating systems, you need to make adjustments manually before migration. The relevant articles contain instructions about how to do this.
**Linux boot** | If /boot is on a dedicated partition, it should reside on the OS disk, and not be spread across multiple disks.<br/> If /boot is part of the root (/) partition, then the ‘/’ partition should be on the OS disk, and not span other disks.
**UEFI boot** | VMs with UEFI boot aren't supported for migration.
**Encrypted disks/volumes** | VMs with encrypted disks/volumes aren't supported for migration.
**RDM/passthrough disks** | If VMs have RDM or passthrough disks, these disks won't be replicated to Azure.
**NFS** | NFS volumes mounted as volumes on the VMs won't be replicated.
**Target disk** | You can migrate to Azure VMs with managed disks only.

## VMware VM agent-based migration

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Machine workload** | Azure Migrate supports migration of any workload (say Active Directory, SQL server etc) running on a supported machine.
**Operating systems** | For the latest information, review the [operating system support](../site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md#replicated-machines) for Site Recovery. Azure Migrate provides identical VM operating system support.
**Linux file system/guest storage** | For the latest information, review the [Linux file system support](../site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md#linux-file-systemsguest-storage) for Site Recovery. Azure Migrate has identical Linux file system support.
**Network/Storage** | For the latest information, review the [network](../site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md#network) and [storage](../site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md#storage) prerequisites for Site Recovery. Azure Migrate provides identical network/storage requirements.
**Azure requirements** | For the latest information, review the [Azure network](../site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md#azure-vm-network-after-failover), [storage](../site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md#azure-storage), and [compute](../site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md#azure-compute) requirements for Site Recovery. Azure Migrate has identical requirements for VMware migration.
**Mobility service** | The Mobility service agent must be installed on each VM you want to migrate.





## Collected data

The Azure Migrate appliance collects machine metadata and performance data, as summarized in the table.

**Data** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Metadata** | VM display name on vCenter Server; VM inventory path (host/cluster/folder) in vCenter Server; IP address, MAC address, operating system, number of cores/disks/NICs; memory/disk sizes; VM power status
**Performance data** | CPU usage; memory usage; per disk information (Disk read/write throughput/Disk read/write operations per second); per NIC information (network in/out).

- Performance data is collected every 20 seconds for each metric. These 20-second datapoints are rolled up to create a single datapoint every five minutes, and sent to Azure for assessment calculation.
- Based on the percentile specified in the assessment, the appropriate value is selected from the five-minute datapoints for assessment computation.
  
## Disk support

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
Migrated disks | VMs can only be migrated to managed disks (standard HHD, premium SSD) in Azure.
   

## URL access requirements

The Azure Migrate appliance needs internet connectivity to the internet.

- When you deploy the appliance, Azure Migrate does a connectivity check to the URLs summarized in the table below.
- If you're using a URL-based firewall.proxy, allow access to these URLs, making sure that the proxy resolves any CNAME records received while looking up the URLs.

**URL** | **Details**  
--- | --- 
*.portal.azure.com | Navigate to the Azure Migrate in the Azure portal.
*.windows.net | Log into your Azure subscription.
*.microsoftonline.com | Create Active Directory apps for the appliance to communicate with the Azure Migrate service. 
management.azure.com | Create Active Directory apps for the appliance to communicate with the Azure Migrate service.
dc.services.visualstudio.com | Upload app logs used for internal monitoring.
*.vault.azure.net | Manage secrets in the Azure Key Vault.
*.servicebus.windows.net | Communication between the appliance and the Azure Migrate service.
*.discoverysrv.windowsazure.com | 
*.migration.windowsazure.com | *.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com | Connect to Azure Migrate service URLs.
*.blob.core.windows.net | Upload data to storage accounts.

## Required ports

### Assessment ports

**Device** | **Connection**
--- | --- 
Appliance | Inbound connections on TCP port 3389 to allow remote desktop connections to the appliance.<br/> Inbound connections on port 44368 to remotely access the appliance management app using the URL: https://<appliance-ip-or-name>:44368 <br/>Outbound connections on port 443 to send discovery and performance metadata to Azure Migrate.
vCenter server | Inbound connections on TCP port 443 to allow the appliance to collect configuration and performance metadata for assessments. <br/> The appliance connects to vCenter on port 443 by default. If the vCenter server listens on a different port, you can modify the port when you set up discovery.


## Agentless migration

**Device** | **Connection**
--- | --- 
Appliance | Outbound connections on port 443 to upload replicated data to the Azure storage account, and to communicate with Azure Migrate services for replication and migration.
vCenter server | Inbound connections on TCP port 443 to allow the appliance to orchestrate replication, create snapshots, copy data, release snapshots.
vSphere/EXSi hosts | Inbound connections on TCP port 902 for the appliance to replicate data from snapshots.

## Agent-based migration

**Device** | **Connection**
--- | --- 
VMs | VMs communicate with the on-premises configuration server on port HTTPS 443 inbound, for replication management.<br/> VMs send replication data to the process server (running on the configuration server machine) on port HTTPS 9443 inbound. This port can be modified.
Configuration server | The configuration server orchestrates replication with Azure over port HTTPS 443 outbound.
Process server | The process server receives replication data, optimizes and encrypts it, and sends it to Azure storage over port 443 outbound.
