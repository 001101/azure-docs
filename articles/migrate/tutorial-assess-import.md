# Assess servers by importing into Azure Migrate: Server Assessment

This article shows you how to assess on-premises servers by importing server metadata using the Azure Migrate: Server Assessment tool. The import can be done by uploading a .CSV file containing the server information. There is no requirement to set up an appliance. 

Assessing using import is useful in the following scenarios:
 * You are looking for a quick initial assessment before you can deploy the appliance 
 * You are not able to deploy the Azure Migrate appliance or share credentials to on-premise servers.
 * Security constraints disallow deploying an appliance due to the data collected and sent by the appliance to Azure. With import, you can control what data you share. For example, providing IP address is optional.

[Azure Migrate](migrate-services-overview.md) provides a hub of tools that help you to discover, assess, and migrate apps, infrastructure, and workloads to Microsoft Azure. The hub includes Azure Migrate tools, and third-party independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up an Azure Migrate project.
> * Add servers to Azure Migrate by uploading server information in a .CSV file. 
> * Add configuration and performance data for these servers to Azure Migrate.
> * Group discovered servers, and assess the server group.
> * Review the assessment.

> [!NOTE]
> Tutorials show you the simplest deployment path for a scenario so that you can quickly set up a proof-of-concept. Tutorials use default options where possible, and don't show all possible settings and paths. For detailed instructions, review the How-to articles.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) before you begin.


## Prerequisites

Your Azure account needs permissions to create an Azure Migrate project for assessment and migration.

1. In the Azure portal, open the subscription, and select **Access control (IAM)**.
2. In **Check access**, find the relevant account, and click it to view permissions.
3. You should have **Contributor** or **Owner** permissions.
    - If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.
    - If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.


## Set up an Azure Migrate project

Set up a new Azure Migrate project as follows.

1. In the Azure portal > **All services**, search for **Azure Migrate**.

## Upload the server information

Now, import the servers into Azure Migrate: Server Assessment.

1. In the Azure portal, in **Discover machines**, browse to the file populated with the server information.
2. Click **Import**. You can see the status of the import. When completed, you will see an **Import status** of **Completed** or **Failed**.
3. You may see warnings in the **Import status**. It is optional to address warnings. Click **Download warning details .CSV**. Warnings provide remediation guidance to help you improve the accuracy of the assessment by enhancing the server information provided. You can proceed with the assessments without addressing the remediation guidance provided as warnings. 
    - Open the .CSV file downloaded. This is the .CSV file you upload along with an additional column containing warnings.
    - Review the warnings in the **Error details** column.
    - Optionally, modify the server information as per the remediation guidance.
4. You may see errors in the **Import status**. You cannot proceed with the import without fixing these errors.
    - Open the .CSV file downloaded. This is the .CSV file you upload along with an additional column containing error details
    - Review the errors in the **Error details** column.
    - Address the errors as per the remediation guidance provided in the column
    - Upload the modified file again.

The servers have now been imported. 

### Verify servers in the portal

After discovery, you can verify that the servers appear in the Azure portal.

1. Open the Azure Migrate dashboard.
2. In **Azure Migrate - Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** page, click the icon that displays the count for **Discovered servers**.
3. Click on the **Import based** tab.

## Set up an assessment

There are two types of assessments you can create using Azure Migrate: Server Assessment.

**Assessment** | **Details** | **Data**
--- | --- | ---
**Performance-based** | Assessments based on performance data values specified | **Recommended VM size**: Based on CPU and memory utilization data.<br/><br/> **Recommended disk type (standard or premium managed disk)**: Based on the IOPS and throughput of the on-premises disks.
**As on-premises** | Assessments based on on-premises sizing. | **Recommended VM size**: Based on the server size specified<br/><br> **Recommended disk type**: Based on the storage type setting you select for the assessment.


### Run an assessment

Run an assessment as follows:

1. Review the [best practices](best-practices-assessment.md) for creating assessments.
2. In the **Servers** tab, in **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** tile, click **Assess**.

7. Click **Export assessment**, to download it as an Excel file.



## Review an assessment

An assessment describes:

- **Azure readiness**: Whether servers are suitable for migration to Azure.
- **Monthly cost estimation**: The estimated monthly compute and storage costs for running the servers in Azure.
- **Monthly storage cost estimation**: Estimated costs for disk storage after migration.

### View an assessment

1. In **Migration goals** >  **Servers**, click **Assessments** in **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**.
2. In **Assessments**, click on an assessment to open it.

    ![Assessment summary](./media/tutorial-assess-physical/assessment-summary.png)

### Review Azure readiness

1. In **Azure readiness**, verify whether the servers are ready for migration to Azure.
2. Review the status:
    - **Ready for Azure**: Azure Migrate recommends a VM size and cost estimates for VMs in the assessment.
    - **Ready with conditions**: Shows issues and suggested remediation.
    - **Not ready for Azure**: Shows issues and suggested remediation.
    - **Readiness unknown**: Used when Azure Migrate can't assess readiness, due to data availability issues.

2. Click on an **Azure readiness** status. You can view server readiness details, and drill down to see server details, including compute, storage, and network settings.

### Review cost details

This view shows the estimated compute and storage cost of running VMs in Azure.

1. Review the monthly compute and storage costs. Costs are aggregated for all servers in the assessed group.

    - Cost estimates are based on the size recommendations for a machine, and its disks and properties.
    - Estimated monthly costs for compute and storage are shown.
    - The cost estimation is for running the on-premises servers as IaaS VMs. Azure Migrate Server Assessment doesn't consider PaaS or SaaS costs.

2. You can review monthly storage cost estimates. This view shows aggregated storage costs for the assessed group, split over different types of storage disks.
3. You can drill down to see details for specific VMs.
