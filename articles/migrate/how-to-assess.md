# Select assessment tools

This article describes how to add assessment tools in the [Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) hub. 

The [Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) hub provides Azure Migrate tools for assessment and migration, as well as third-party independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.

If you want to add an assessment tool and you don't yet have an Azure Migrate project, follow this [article](how-to-add-tool-first-time.md).


## Select a tool

1. In Azure Migrate > **Overview**, click **Assess and Migrate Servers**.
2. In **Azure Migrate - Servers**, next to **Add more assessment tools**, click **Click here**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you need to navigate to a different project, in **Azure Migrate - Servers**, next to **See details for a different migrate project**, click **Click here**.

3. In **Azure Migrate**, select the assessment tool you want to use.
    - If you use Azure Migrate Server Assessment, you can set up, run, and view assessments directly in the Azure Migrate project.
    - If you use a third-party assessment tool, navigate to the link provided for their site, and run the assessment in accordance with the instructions they provide.
