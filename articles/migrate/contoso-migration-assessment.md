## Overview

As Contoso considers migrating to Azure, the company wants to run a technical and financial assessment to determine whether its on-premises workloads are suitable for migration to the cloud. In particular, the Contoso team wants to assess machine and database compatibility for migration, and estimate capacity and costs for running Contoso's resources in Azure.

To get its feet wet and better understand the technologies involved, Contoso is going to assess two of its on-premises apps, summarized in the following table. The company is assessing for migration scenarios that rehost and refactor apps for migration. Learn more about rehosting and refactoring in the [Contoso migration overview](contoso-migration-overview.md).

App name | Platform | App tiers | Details
--- | --- | --- | ---
SmartHotel<br/><br/> (Manages Contoso travel requirements) | Running on Windows with a SQL Server database | Two-tiered app with the front-end ASP.NET website running on one VM (WEBVM) and the SQL Server running on another VM (SQLVM) | VMs are VMware, running on an ESXi host managed by vCenter Server.<br/><br/> You can download the sample app from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/SmartHotel360).
osTicket<br/><br/> (Contoso service desk app) | Running on Linux/Apache, with MySQL PHP (LAMP) | Two-tiered app with a front-end PHP website on one VM (OSTICKETWEB) and the MySQL database running on another VM (OSTICKETMYSQL) | The app is used by customer service apps to track issues for internal employees and external customers.<br/><br/> You can download the sample from [GitHub](https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket).

## Current architecture

Here's a diagram that shows the current Contoso on-premises infrastructure:

![Contoso architecture](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/contoso-architecture.png)  

- Contoso has one main datacenter. The datacenter is located in the city of New York in the Eastern United States.
- Contoso has three additional local branches across the United States.
- The main datacenter is connected to the internet with a fiber Metro Ethernet connection (500 MBps).
- Each branch is connected locally to the internet by using business-class connections with IPsec VPN tunnels back to the main datacenter. The setup allows Contoso's entire network to be permanently connected. It also optimizes internet connectivity.
- The main datacenter is fully virtualized with VMware. Contoso has two ESXi 6.5 virtualization hosts that are managed by vCenter Server 6.5.
- Contoso uses Active Directory for identity management. It uses DNS servers on the internal network.
- The domain controllers in the datacenter run on VMware VMs. The domain controllers at local branches run on physical servers.

## Business drivers

Contoso's IT leadership team has worked closely with the company's business partners to understand what the business wants to achieve with this migration:

- **Address business growth**: Contoso is growing. As a result, pressure has increased on the company's on-premises systems and infrastructure.
- **Increase efficiency**: Contoso needs to remove unnecessary procedures and streamline processes for its developers and users. The business needs IT to be fast and to not waste time or money, so the company can deliver faster on customer requirements.
- **Increase agility**:  Contoso IT needs to be more responsive to the needs of the business. It must be able to react faster than the changes that occur in the marketplace for the company to be successful in a global economy. IT at Contoso must not get in the way or become a business blocker.
- **Scale**: As the company's business grows successfully, Contoso IT must provide systems that can grow at the same pace.

## Assessment goals

The Contoso cloud team has identified goals for its migration assessments:

- After migration, apps in Azure should have the same performance capabilities that apps have today in Contoso's on-premises VMWare environment. Moving to the cloud doesn't mean that app performance is less critical.
- Contoso needs to understand the compatibility of its applications and databases with Azure requirements. Contoso also needs to understand its hosting options in Azure.
- Contoso's database administration should be minimized after apps move to the cloud.  
- Contoso wants to understand not only its migration options, but also the costs associated with the infrastructure after it moves to the cloud.

## Assessment tools

Contoso uses Microsoft tools for its migration assessment. The tools align with the company's goals, and should provide Contoso with all the information it needs.

Technology | Description | Cost
--- | --- | ---
[Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=ssdt-18vs2017) | Contoso uses Data Migration Assistant to assess and detect compatibility issues that might affect its database functionality in Azure. Data Migration Assistant assesses feature parity between SQL sources and targets, and recommends performance and reliability improvements. | Data Migration Assistant is a free, downloadable tool.
[Azure Migrate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-overview) | Contoso uses this service to assess its VMware VMs. Azure Migrate assesses the migration suitability of the machines, and provides sizing and cost estimates for running in Azure.  | As of May 2018, Azure Migrate is a free service.
[Service Map](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/operations-management-suite/operations-management-suite-service-map) | Azure Migrate uses Service Map to show dependencies between machines that you want to migrate. | Service Map is part of Azure Log Analytics. Currently, Contoso can use Service Map for 180 days without incurring charges.

In this scenario, Contoso downloads and runs Data Migration Assistant to assess the on-premises SQL Server database for its travel app. Contoso uses Azure Migrate with dependency mapping to assess the app VMs before migration to Azure.

## Assessment architecture

![Migration assessment architecture](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/migration-assessment-architecture.png)

- Contoso is a fictitious name that represents a typical enterprise organization.
- Contoso has an on-premises datacenter (**contoso-datacenter**) and on-premises domain controllers (CONTOSODC1, CONTOSODC2).
- VMware VMs are located on VMware ESXi hosts running version 6.5: **contosohost1**, **contosohost2**.
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (**vcenter**, running on a VM).
- The SmartHotel travel app:
    - The app is tiered across two VMware VMs: **WEBVM** and **SQLVM**.
    - The VMs are located on VMware ESXi host **contosohost1.contoso.com**.
    - The VMs are running Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter with SP1.
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server (**vcenter.contoso.com**) running on a VM.
- The osTicket service desk app:
    - The app is tiered across two VMs: **OSTICKETWEB** and **OSTICKETMYSQL**.
    - The VMs are running Ubuntu Linux Server 16.04-LTS.
    - **OSTICKETWEB** is running Apache 2 and PHP 7.0.
    - **OSTICKETMYSQL** is running MySQL 5.7.22.

![Architecture](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/architecture.png)

## Prerequisites

Here's what Contoso needs for the assessment:

- Owner or Contributor rights for the Azure subscription, or for a resource group in the Azure subscription.
- An on-premises vCenter Server instance running version 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5.
- A read-only account in vCenter Server, or user rights to create one.
- User rights to create a VM on the vCenter Server instance by using an .ova template.
- At least one ESXi host running version 5.0 or later.
- At least two on-premises VMware VMs, one running a SQL Server database.
- User rights to install Azure Migrate agents on each VM.
- The VMs should have direct internet connectivity.  
        - You can restrict internet access to the [required URLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/concepts-collector#collector-pre-requisites).  
        - If your VMs don't have internet connectivity, the [OMS gateway](../log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-gateway.md) needs to be installed on them.
- The FQDN of the VM running the SQL Server instance, for database assessment.
- Windows Firewall running on the SQL Server VM should allow external connections on TCP port 1433 (default). The setup allows Data Migration Assistant to connect.

## Assessment overview

Here's how Contoso will perform its assessment:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * **Step 1: Download and install Download Migration Assistant**: Prepare Download Migration Assistant for assessment of the on-premises SQL Server database.
> * **Step 2: Assess the database by using Download Migration Assistant**: Run and analyze the database assessment.
> * **Step 3: Prepare for VM assessment by using Azure Migrate**: Set up on-premises accounts and adjust VMware settings.
> * **Step 4: Discover on-premises VMs by using Azure Migrate**: Create an Azure Migrate collector VM. Then, Contoso runs the collector to discover VMs for assessment.
> * **Step 5: Prepare for dependency analysis by using Azure Migrate**: Install Azure Migrate agents on the VMs, so that the company can see dependency mapping between VMs.
> * **Step 6: Assess the VMs by using Azure Migrate**: Check dependencies, group the VMs, and run the assessment. When the assessment is ready, Contoso analyzes it in preparation for migration.

## Step 1: Download and install Download Migration Assistant

1. Contoso downloads Download Migration Assistant from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53595).
    - Download Migration Assistant can be installed on any machine that can connect to the SQL Server instance. You don't need to run it on the SQL Server machine.
    - Download Migration Assistant shouldn't be run on the SQL Server host machine.
2. Contoso runs the downloaded setup file (DownloadMigrationAssistant.msi), to start the installation.
3. On the **Finish** page, Contoso selects **Launch Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** before finishing the wizard.

## Step 2: Run and analyze the database assessment for SmartHotel

Now, Contoso can run an assessment to analyze its on-premises SQL Server database for the SmartHotel app.

1. In Data Migration Assistant, Contoso clicks **New**, selects **Assessment**, and then gives the assessment a project name: **SmartHotel**.
2. For **Source server type**, Contoso selects **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines**.

    ![Select source](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/dma-assessment-1.png)

    > [!NOTE]
      Currently, Data Migration Assistant doesn't support assessment for migrating to a SQL Database Managed Instance. As a workaround, Contoso uses SQL Server on Azure VM as the supposed target for the assessment.

3. In **Select Target Version**, Consoto selects SQL Server 2017 as the target version. Contoso needs to select this version because it's the version used by the SQL Database Managed Instance.
4. Contoso selects reports to help it discover information about compatibility and new features:
    - **Compatibility Issues** note changes that might break migration or that require a minor adjustment before migration. This report keeps Contoso informed about any features currently in use that are deprecated. Issues are organized by compatibility level.
    - **New features' recommendation** notes new features in the target SQL Server platform that can be used for the database after migration. New feature recommendations are organized under the headings **Performance**, **Security**, and **Storage**.

    ![Select target](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/dma-assessment-2.png)

2. In the **Connect to a server** dialog box, Contoso enters the name of the VM that's running the database and credentials to access it. Contoso needs to enable **Trust server certificate** to make sure it can access SQL Server. Then, Contoso selects **Connect**.

    ![Select target](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/dma-assessment-3.png)

3. In **Add source**, Contoso adds the database it wants to assess, and then selects **Next** to start the assessment.
4. The assessment is created.

    ![Create assessment](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/dma-assessment-4.png)

5. In **Review Results**, Contoso can see the assessment results.

### Analyze the database assessment

Results are displayed as soon as they're available. If Contoso fixes issues, it must select **Restart Assessment** to rerun the assessment.

1. In the **Compatibility Issues** report, Contoso checks for any issues at each compatibility level. Compatibility levels map to SQL Server versions as follows:

    - 100: SQL Server 2008/Azure SQL Database
    - 110: SQL Server 2012/Azure SQL Database
    - 120: SQL Server 2014/Azure SQL Database
    - 130: SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL Database
    - 140: SQL Server 2017/Azure SQL Database

    ![Compatibility issues](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/dma-assessment-5.png)

2. In the **Feature recommendations** report, Contoso can view performance, security, and storage features that the assessment recommends after migration. A variety of features are recommended, including In-Memory OLTP and columnstore indexes, Stretch Database, Always Encrypted, dynamic data masking, and transparent data encryption.

    ![Feature recommendations](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/dma-assessment-6.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > We recommend that Contoso [enables transparent data encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view=sql-server-2017) for all SQL Server databases. This is even more critical when a database is in the cloud. Transparent data encryption should be enabled only after migration. If transparent data encryption is already enabled, you must move the certificate or asymmetric key to the master database of the target server. For more information, see [Move a transparent data encryption-protected database to another SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/move-a-tde-protected-database-to-another-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017).

2. Contoso can export the assessment in JSON or CSV format.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're running a large-scale assessment, you can:
> - Run multiple assessments concurrently and view the state of the assessments on the **All Assessments** page.
> - Consolidate assessments into a [SQL Server database](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-consolidatereports?view=ssdt-18vs2017#import-assessment-results-into-a-sql-server-database).
> - Consolidate assessments into a [PowerBI report](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-powerbiassesreport?view=ssdt-18vs2017).

## Step 3: Prepare for VM assessment by using Azure Migrate

Contoso needs to create a VMware account that Azure Migrate can use to automatically discover VMs for assessment, verify rights to create a VM, note the ports that need to be opened, and set the statistics settings level.

### Set up a VMware account

VM discovery requires a read-only account in vCenter, with the following properties:

- **User type**: At least a read-only user.
- **Permissions**: For the datacenter object, select the **Propagate to Child Objects** checkbox. For **Role**, select **Read-only**.
- **Details**: The user is assigned at the datacenter level, with access to all objects in the datacenter.
- To restrict access, assign the **No access** role with the **Propagate to child** object to the child objects (vSphere hosts, datastores, VMs, and networks).

### Verify permissions to create a VM

Contoso verifies that it has permissions to create a VM by importing a file in .ova format. For more information, see [Create and assign a role with privileges to create and manage virtual machine to a Domain or Local User/Group](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1023189?other.KM_Utility.getArticleLanguage=1&r=2&other.KM_Utility.getArticleData=1&other.KM_Utility.getArticle=1&ui-comm-runtime-components-aura-components-siteforce-qb.Quarterback.validateRoute=1&other.KM_Utility.getGUser=1).

### Verify ports

The Contoso assessment uses dependency mapping. Dependency mapping requires an agent to be installed on VMs that you want to assess. The agent needs to be able to connect to Azure from TCP port 443 on each VM. For more information, see [Collect data from computers in your environment with Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid)  about connection requirements.

### Set statistics settings

Before Contoso begins the deployment, it must set the statistics settings for the vCenter Server to level 3. 

> [!NOTE]
> - After setting the level, you need to wait at least a day before you run the assessment. Otherwise, the assessment might not work as expected.
> - If the level is higher than 3, the assessment works, but:
>    - Performance data for disks and networking isn't collected.
>    - For storage, Azure Migrate recommends a standard disk in Azure, with the same size as the on-premises disk.
>    - For networking, for each on-premises network adapter, a network adapter is  recommended in Azure.
>    - For compute, Azure Migrate looks at the VM cores and memory size and recommends an Azure VM with the same configuration. If there are multiple eligible Azure VM sizes, the one with the lowest cost is recommended.
> - For more information about sizing by using level 3, see [Sizing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/concepts-assessment-calculation#sizing).

To set the level:

1. In the vSphere Web Client, Contoso opens the vCenter Server instance.
2. Contoso selects **Manage** > **Settings** > **General** > **Edit**.
3. In **Statistics**, Contoso sets the statistic level settings to **Level 3**.

    ![vCenter Server statistics level](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/vcenter-statistics-level.png)

## Step 4: Discover VMs

To discover VMs, Contoso creates an Azure Migrate project. Contoso downloads and sets up the collector VM. Then, it runs the collector to discover its on-premises VMs.

### Create a project

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Contoso searches for **Azure Migrate**. Then, it creates a project.
2. Contoso specifies a project name (**ContosoMigration**) and the Azure subscription. It creates a new Azure resource group, **ContosoFailoverRG**. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > - You can create an Azure Migrate project only in the West Central US or East US region.
    > - You can plan a migration for any target location.
    > - The project location is used only to store the metadata that's gathered from on-premises VMs.

    ![Azure Migrate](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/project-1.png)

### Download the collector appliance

Azure Migrate creates an on-premises VM known as the collector appliance. This VM discovers on-premises VMware VMs and sends metadata about the VMs to the Azure Migrate service. To set up the collector appliance, Contoso downloads an OVA template, and then imports it to the on-premises vCenter Server instance to create the VM.

1. In the Azure Migrate project, Contoso selects **Getting Started** > **Discover & Assess** > **Discover Machines**. Contoso downloads the OVA template file.
2. Contoso copies the project ID and key. The project and ID are required for configuring the collector.

    ![Download the OVA file](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/download-ova.png)

### Verify the collector appliance

Before deploying the VM, Contoso checks that the OVA file is secure:

1. On the machine on which the file was downloaded, Contoso opens an administrator Command Prompt window.
2. Contoso runs the following command to generate the hash for the OVA:

    ```C:\>CertUtil -HashFile <file_location> [Hashing Algorithm]```
    
    Example usage: 
    
    ```C:\>CertUtil -HashFile C:\AzureMigrate\AzureMigrate.ova SHA256```
3. The generated hash should match these settings (version 1.0.9.12):

    Algorithm | Hash value
    --- | ---
    MD5 | d0363e5d1b377a8eb08843cf034ac28a
    SHA1 | df4a0ada64bfa59c37acf521d15dcabe7f3f716b
    SHA256 | f677b6c255e3d4d529315a31b5947edfe46f45e4eb4dbc8019d68d1d1b337c2e

### Create the collector appliance

Now Contoso can import the downloaded file to the vCenter Server and provision the configuration server VM.

1. In the vSphere Client console, Contoso selects **File** > **Deploy OVF Template**.

    ![Deploy OVF](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/vcenter-wizard.png)

2. In the Deploy OVF Template Wizard, Contoso selects **Source**, and then specifies the location of the OVA file.
3. In **Name and Location**, Contoso specifies a display name for the collector VM. Then, it selects the inventory location in which to host the VM. Contoso also specifies the host or cluster on which to run the collector appliance.
5. In **Storage**, Contoso specifies the storage location. In **Disk Format**, Contoso selects how it wants to provision the storage.
7. In **Network Mapping**, Contoso specifies the network in which to connect the collector VM. The network needs internet connectivity to send metadata to Azure.
8. Contoso reviews the settings, and then selects **Power on after deployment** > **Finish**. A message that confirms successful completion appears when the appliance is created.

### Run the collector to discover VMs

Now, Contoso runs the collector to discover VMs. Currently, the collector currently supports only **English (United States)** as the operating system language and collector interface language.

1. In the vSphere Client console, Contoso selects **Open Console**. Contoso specifies the language, time zone, and password preferences for the collector VM.
2. On the desktop, Contoso selects the **Run collector** shortcut.

    ![Collector shortcut](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/collector-shortcut.png)

4. In the Azure Migrate Collector, Contoso selects **Set up prerequisites**. Contoso accepts the license terms and reads the third-party information.
5. The collector checks that the VM has internet access, that the time is synchronized, and that the collector service is running. (The collector service is installed by default on the VM.) Contoso also installs VMWare PowerCLI.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It's assumed that the VM has direct access to the internet without using a proxy.

    ![Verify prerequisites](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/collector-verify-prereqs.png)

6. In the **Specify vCenter Server details** dialog box, Contoso specifies the name (FQDN) or IP address of the vCenter Server instance and the read-only credentials used for discovery.
7. Contoso selects a scope for VM discovery. The collector can discover only VMs that are within the specified scope. The scope can be set to a specific folder, datacenter, or cluster. The scope shouldn't contain more than 1,500 VMs.

	![Connect to vCenter Server](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/collector-connect-vcenter.png)

8. In the **Specify migration project** dialog box, Contoso specifies the Azure Migrate project ID and key that were copied from the portal. To get the project ID and key, go to the project **Overview** page > **Discover Machines**.  

    ![Connect to Azure](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/collector-connect-azure.png)

9. In the **View collection progress** window, Contoso can monitor discovery and check that metadata collected from the VMs is in scope. The collector provides an approximate discovery time.

    ![Collection in progress](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/collector-collection-process.png)

### Verify VMs in the portal

When collection is finished, Contoso checks that the VMs appear in the portal:

1. In the Azure Migrate project, Contoso selects **Manage** > **Machines**. Contoso checks that the VMs that it wants to discover are shown.

    ![Discovered machines](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/discovery-complete.png)

2. The machines currently don't have the Azure Migrate agents installed. Contoso needs to install the agents to view dependencies.

    ![Agent installation is required](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/machines-no-agent.png)

## Step 5: Prepare for dependency analysis

To view dependencies between VMs that it wants to access, Contoso downloads and installs agents on the app VMs. Contoso does this on all VMs for their apps, both for Windows and Linux.

### Take a snapshot

To keep a copy of the VMs before modifying them, Contoso takes a snapshot before the agents are installed.

![Machine snapshot](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/snapshot-vm.png)

### Download and install the VM agents

1. In the **Machines** pane, Contoso selects the machine. In the **Dependencies** column, Contoso selects **Requires installation**.
2. In the **Discover Machines** pane, Contoso does the following actions:
	- Downloads the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and Dependency Agent for each Windows VM.
	- Downloads the MMA and Dependency Agent for each Linux VM.
3. Contoso copies the workspace ID and key. Contoso needs the workspace ID and key when it installs the MMA.

    ![Agent download](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/download-agents.png)

### Install the agents on Windows VMs

Contoso runs the installation on each VM.

#### Install the MMA on Windows VMs

1. Contoso double-clicks the downloaded agent.
2. On the **Destination Folder** page, Contoso keeps the default installation folder, and then selects **Next**.
3. On the **Agent Setup Options** page, Contoso selects **Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics** > **Next**.

    ![Microsoft Monitoring Agent Setup - Agent Setup Options page](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/mma-install.png)

4. On the **Azure Log Analytics** page, Contoso pastes the workspace ID and key that it copied from the portal.

	![Microsoft Monitoring Agent Setup - Azure Log Analytics page](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/mma-install2.png)

5. On the **Ready to Install** page, Contoso installs the MMA.

#### Install the Dependency agent on Windows VMs

1. Contoso double-clicks the downloaded Dependency Agent.
2. Contoso accepts the license terms and waits for the installation to finish.

    ![Dependency Agent Setup - Installing page](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/dependency-agent.png)

### Install the agents on Linux VMs

Contoso runs the installation on each VM.

#### Install the MMA on Linux VMs

1. Contoso installs the Python ctypes library on each VM by using the following command:

    `sudo apt-get install python-ctypeslib`
2. Contoso must run the command to install the MMA agent as root. To become root, run the following command and enter the root password:

    `sudo -i`
3. Contoso installs the MMA:
    - Insert your workspace ID and key in the command.
    - Commands are for 64-bit.
    - The workspace ID and primary key are located in the Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS) portal. Select **Settings**, and then select the **Connected Sources** tab.
    - Run the following commands to download the OMS agent, validate the checksum, and install and onboard the agent:

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w 6b7fcaff-7efb-4356-ae06-516cacf5e25d -s k7gAMAw5Bk8pFVUTZKmk2lG4eUciswzWfYLDTxGcD8pcyc4oT8c6ZRgsMy3MmsQSHuSOcmBUsCjoRiG2x9A8Mg==
    ```

#### Install the Dependency Agent on Linux VMs

After the MMA is installed, Contoso installs the Dependency Agent on the Linux VMs:

1. The Dependency Agent is installed on Linux computers by using InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin, a shell script that has a self-extracting binary. Contoso runs the file by using sh, or it adds execute permissions to the file itself.

2. Contoso installs the Linux Dependency Agent as root:

    ```
    wget --content-disposition https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux -O InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin && sudo sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -s
    ```

## Step 6: Run and analyze the VM assessment

Contoso can now verify machine dependencies and create a group. Then, it runs the assessment for the group.

### Verify dependencies and create a group

1. To determine which machines to analyze, Contoso selects **View Dependencies**.

    ![View machine dependencies](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/view-machine-dependencies.png)

2. For the SQLVM, the dependency map shows the following details:

    - Process groups or processes that have active network connections running on SQLVM during the specified time period (an hour, by default).
    - Inbound (client) and outbound (server) TCP connections to and from all dependent machines.
    - Dependent machines that have the Azure Migrate agents installed are shown as separate boxes.
    - Machines that don't have the agents installed show port and IP address information.

3. For machines that have the agent installed (WEBVM), Contoso selects the machine box to view more information. More information includes the FQDN, operating system, and MAC address.

    ![View group dependencies](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/sqlvm-dependencies.png)

4. Contoso selects the VMs to add to the group (SQLVM and WEBVM). Contoso uses Ctrl+Click to select multiple VMs.
5. Contoso selects **Create Group** and enters a name (**smarthotelapp**).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To view more granular dependencies, you can expand the time range. You can select a specific duration or select start and end dates.

### Run an assessment

1. On the **Groups** page, Contoso opens the group (**smarthotelapp**), and then selects **Create assessment**.

    ![Create an assessment](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/run-vm-assessment.png)

2. To view the assessment, Contoso selects **Manage** > **Assessments**.

Contoso uses the default assessment settings, but you can [customize settings](how-to-modify-assessment.md).

### Analyze the VM assessment

An Azure Migrate assessment includes information about the compatibility of on-premises with Azure, suggested right-sizing for Azure VM, and estimated monthly Azure costs.

![Assessment report](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/assessment-overview.png)

#### Review confidence rating

![Assessment display](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/assessment-display.png)

An assessment has a confidence rating of from 1 star to 5 stars (1 star is the lowest and 5 stars is the highest).
- The confidence rating is assigned to an assessment based on the availability of data points that are needed to compute the assessment.
- The rating helps you estimate the reliability of the size recommendations that are provided by Azure Migrate.
- The confidence rating is useful when you are doing *performance-based sizing*. Azure Migrate might not have enough data points for utilization-based sizing. For *as on-premises* sizing, the confidence rating is always 5 stars because Azure Migrate has all the data points it needs to size the VM.
- Depending on the percentage of data points available, the confidence rating for the assessment is provided:

   Availability of data points | Confidence rating
   --- | ---
   0%-20% | 1 star
   21%-40% | 2 stars
   41%-60% | 3 stars
   61%-80% | 4 stars
   81%-100% | 5 stars

#### Verify Azure readiness

![Assessment readiness](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/azure-readiness.png)  

The assessment report shows the information that's summarized in the table. To show performance-based sizing, Azure Migrate needs the following information. If the information can't be collected, sizing assessment might not be accurate.

- Utilization data for CPU and memory.
- Read/write IOPS and throughput for each disk attached to the VM.
- Network in/out information for each network adapter attached to the VM.

Setting | Indication | Details
--- | --- | ---
**Azure VM readiness** | Indicates whether the VM is ready for migration. | Possible states:</br><br/>- Ready for Azure<br/><br/>- Ready with conditions <br/><br/>- Not ready for Azure<br/><br/>- Readiness unknown<br/><br/> If a VM isn't ready, Azure Migrate shows some remediation steps.
**Azure VM size** | For ready VMs, Azure Migrate provides an Azure VM size recommendation. | Sizing recommendation depends on assessment properties:<br/><br/>- If you used performance-based sizing, sizing considers the performance history of the VMs.<br/><br/>- If you used *as on-premises*', sizing is based on the on-premises VM size and utilization data isn't used.
**Suggested tool** | Because Azure machines are running the agents, Azure Migrate looks at the processes that are running inside the machine. It identifies whether the machine is a database machine.
**VM information** | The report shows settings for the on-premises VM, including operating system, boot type, and disk and storage information.

#### Review monthly cost estimates

This view shows the total compute and storage cost of running the VMs in Azure. It also shows details for each machine.

![Assessment readiness](./media/contoso-migration-assessment/azure-costs.png)

- Cost estimates are calculated by using the size recommendations for a machine.
- Estimated monthly costs for compute and storage are aggregated for all VMs in the group.

## Clean up after assessment

- When the assessment finishes, Contoso retains the Azure Migrate appliance to use in future evaluations.
- Contoso turns off the VMware VM. Contoso will use it again when it evaluates additional VMs.
- Contoso keeps the Contoso Migration project in Azure. The project currently is deployed in the ContosoFailoverRG resource group in the East US Azure Region.
-  The collector VM has a 180-day evaluation license. If this limit expires, Contoso will need to download the collector and set it up again.

## Conclusion

In this scenario, Contoso assesses its SmartHotel app database by using the Data Migration Assessment tool. It assesses the on-premises VMs by using the Azure Migrate service. Contoso reviewed the assessments to make sure that on-premises resources are ready for migration to Azure.

## Next steps

In the next article in the series, Contoso rehosts its SmartHotel app in Azure by using a lift-and-shift migration. Contoso migrates the front-end WEBVM for the app by using Azure Site Recovery. It migrates the app database to an Azure SQL Managed Instance by using the Database Migration Service. [Get started](contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance.md) with this deployment.
