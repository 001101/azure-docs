# About Azure Migrate

Azure Migrate discovers, assesses, and migrates machines and workloads to the Microsoft Azure cloud.

There are currently two versions of Azure Migrate:

- **Current version (in public preview)**: Using the current version of Azure Migrate, you can assess on-premises VMware VMs and Hyper-V VMs for migration to Azure, and migrate VMware VMs. [Learn more](migrate-overview.md#azure-migrate-public-preview).
- **Classic version**: Using the classic version of Azure Migrate, you can assess on-premises VMware VMs for migration to Azure.


## Which version of the service should I use?

**Task** | **Recommendation**
--- | ---
**Assess VMware VMs in a production environment** | Use the current public preview version after reviewing the [support matrix](migrate-support-matrix.md).
**Assess Hyper-V VMs in a production environment** | Use the current public preview after reviewing the [support matrix](migrate-support-matrix.md)
**Migrate VMware VMs to Azure** | For small migrations, use the current public preview after reviewing the [support matrix](migrate-support-matrix.md)
**Migrate or automate large-scale VMware VMs** | Use [Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/migrate-tutorial-on-premises-azure) during public preview.



## Azure Migrate services public preview

The public preview provides a number of new features.

**Appliance**: A lightweight, easily-deployed appliance for discovery and assessment of on-premises VMware VMs and Hyper-V VMs.
**Improved user experience**: The deployment flow in the Azure portal is improved and streamlined.
**Continuous discovery of VMs**: There's no longer a need to trigger discovery when something changes on-premises.
**Improved performance-based assessment**: You no longer need to modify the vCenter Server statistics level to run performance-based assessment. The Azure Migrate appliance now measures performance data of the VMs.
**Migrate VMware VMs**:  Use Azure Migrate for the entire discovery, assessment, and migration process for VMware VMs. 
    - **Agentless migration**: You can migrate VMware VMs without installing anything on the VM.
    - **Unified Azure Migrate appliance**: A single appliance running on a VMware VM handles discovery, assessment, and migration. You don't need additional Azure Migrate components.


## VMware architecture 

This section describes the architecture for VMware assessment and migration using the new public preview version of Azure Migrate.

![Assessment architecture VMware](./media/migrate-overview/sas-architecture-vmware.png)

The process is as follows:

1. You create an Azure Migrate appliance running as a VMware VM. To create the VM, you download an OVF template from Azure portal, and import it to vCenter Server.
2. You connect to this VM, and run the Collector app that's installed on it.
3. The Collector app discovers VM information from vCenter Server.
4. The appliance is always connected to the Azure Migrate service, and continually sends metadata and performance-related data from the VMs to Azure.
    - Nothing needs to be installed on the VMs you're discovering.
    - VM metadata includes information about cores, memory, disks, disk sizes, and network adapters.
    - Performance data includes information about CPU and memory usage, disk IOPS, disk throughput (MBps) , and network output (MBps).
5. After discovery finishes, in the Azure portal you gather discovered VMs into groups.and run an assessment on each group. A group typically consists of VMs that you'd like to migrate together.
6. After the assessment finishes, you can view it in the portal, or download it in Excel format.

### VMware ports
Azure Migrate uses the following connection ports for VMware:

**Source** | **Target** | **Port** | **Details**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Azure Migrate appliance | Azure Migrate service | Target-TCP 443 | Send metadata and performance data to Azure Migrate.
Azure Migrate appliance | vCenter Server | Target-TCP 443 | Connect to vCenter Server for metadata and performance data. 443 is default but can be modified with vCenter listens on a different port. 
RDP client | Azure Migrate appliance | Target-TCP3389 | RDP connection to trigger discovery from the appliance.

## Hyper-V architecture

This section describes the architecture for Hyper-V assessment using the new public preview version of Azure Migrate.

![Assessment architecture Hyper-V](./media/migrate-overview/sas-architecture-hyper-v.png)

The process is as follows:


1. You create an Azure Migrate appliance running as a Hyper-V VM. To do this, you download the VM in a compressed format and import it onto a Hyper-V host.
2. You connect to this VM, and run the Collector app that's installed on it.
3. You specify a list of Hyper-V hosts/clusters running the VMs you want to discover.
4. The appliance is always connected to the Azure Migrate service, and continually sends metadata and performance-related data from the VMs to Azure. The appliance uses CIM sessions to connect and collect VM information.
    - Nothing needs to be installed on the VMs you're discovering.
    - VM metadata includes information about cores, memory, disks, disk sizes, and network adapters.
    - Performance data includes information about CPU and memory usage, disk IOPS, disk throughput (MBps) , and network output (MBps).
5. After discovery finishes, in the Azure portal you gather discovered VMs into groups.and run an assessment on each group. A group typically consists of VMs that you'd like to migrate together.
6. After the assessment finishes, you can view it in the portal, or download it in Excel format.

### Hyper-V ports

Azure Migrate service uses the following connection ports for Hyper-V:

**Source** | **Target** | **Port** | **Details**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Azure Migrate appliance | Azure Migrate service | Target-TCP 443 | Send metadata and performance data to Azure Migrate.
Azure Migrate appliance | Hyper-V host/cluster | Target-Default WinRM ports-HTTP:5985; HTTPS:5986 | Connect to host for metadata and performance data. CIM session used for connection
RDP client | Azure Migrate appliance | Target-TCP3389 | RDP connection to trigger discovery from the appliance.

## Azure Migrate classic version

The classic version of Azure Migrate provides the following:

- **VMware VM assessment**: Discover and assess on-premises VMware VMs as follows:
    - **Assess Azure readiness**: Assess whether your on-premises machines are suitable for running in Azure.
    - **Get size recommendations**: Get size recommendations for Azure VMs based on the performance history of on-premises VMs.
    - **Estimate monthly costs**: Get estimated costs for running on-premises machines in Azure.  
    - **Assess with higher confidence**: Visualize dependencies of on-premises machines to create groups of machines that you will assess and migrate together.
- **Migration**: Azure Migrate doesn't perform the migration. After the assessment, you can use services such as [Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview) and [Azure Database Migration Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/dms-overview), to migrate the machines to Azure.

### How does it work? (classic version)

1. You create an Azure Migrate appliance running as a VMware VM. The appliance is created from an OVF template.
2. You connect to this VM, and run the Collector app that's installed on it.
3. You run the Collector app and trigger VM discovery. The appliance sends VM metadata and performance-related data from the VMs to Azure. Nothing needs to be installed on the VMs you're discovering.
    - VM metadata includes information about cores, memory, disks, disk sizes, and network adapters.
    - Performance data includes information about CPU and memory usage, disk IOPS, disk throughput (MBps) , and network output (MBps).
4. After discovery finishes, in the Azure portal you gather discovered VMs into groups and run an assessment on each group. A group typically consists of VMs that you'd like to migrate together. For more precise groups you can use the dependency visualization feature to view dependencies for a specific VM, or for all VMs in a group.
5. After the assessment finishes, you can view it in the portal, or download it in Excel format.

#### Connection ports

The following connection ports are used.


**Source** | **Target** | **Port** | **Details**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Collector  | Azure Migrate service | Target-TCP 443 | Send metadata and performance data to Azure Migrate.
Collector | vCenter Server | Target-TCP 443 | Connect to vCenter Server for metadata and performance data. 443 is default but can be modified with vCenter listens on a different port. 
On-premises VM | Log Analytics Workspace | [TCP 443] | [The Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)](../log-analytics/log-analytics-windows-agent.md) uses TCP port 443 to connect to Log Analytics. You only need this port if you're using dependency visualization, that requires the MMA agent.


## What happens after assessment?

After you've assessed on-premises machines, you can a number of tools for migration:

- **Azure Migrate**: Use to migrate low numbers of VMware VMs to Azure.
- **Azure Site Recovery**: Use to migrate large number of VMware VMs, or Hyper-V VMs to Azure.
- **Database Migration Service**: If on-premises machines are running a database such as SQL Server, MySQL, or Oracle, you can use the [Azure Database Migration Service](../dms/dms-overview.md) to migrate them to Azure.
