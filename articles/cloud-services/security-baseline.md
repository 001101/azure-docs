# Azure security baseline for Cloud Services

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Cloud Services. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Cloud Services. **Controls** not applicable to Cloud Services have been excluded.

 
To see how Cloud Services completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Cloud Services security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32173.).

**Guidance**: Create a classic Azure Virtual Network with separate public and private subnets to enforce isolation based on trusted ports and IP ranges. These virtual network and subnets must be the classic Virtual Network (classic deployment) based resources, and not the current Azure Resource Manager resources.  

Allow or deny traffic using a network security group, which contains access control rules based on traffic direction, protocol, source address and port, and destination address and port. The rules of an network security group can be changed at any time, and changes are applied to all associated instances.

Cloud service (Classic) cannot be placed in Azure Resource Manager virtual networks. However, Resource Manager virtual networks and classic deployment virtual networks can be connected through peering.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32174.).

**Guidance**: Document your Cloud service configuration and monitor it for changes. Use the service's configuration file to specify the number of role instances to deploy for each role in the service, the values of any configuration settings, and the thumbprints for any certificates associated with a role. 

If the service is part of an Virtual Network, configuration information for the network must be provided in the service configuration file, as well as in the virtual networking configuration file. The default extension for the service configuration file is .cscfg.

Note that Azure Policy is not supported for Cloud service (Classic) for configuration enforcement.

Set a Cloud service's (Classic) configuration values in the service configuration file (.cscfg) and the definition in an service definition (.csdef) file. Use the service definition file to define the service model for an application. Define the roles, which are available to a Cloud service (Classic) and also specify the service endpoints. 

Log the configuration for Cloud service (Classic) with service configuration file. Any reconfiguration can be done through the ServiceConfig.cscfg file. 

Monitor the optional NetworkTrafficRules element service definition which restricts which roles can communicate to specified internal endpoints. Configure the NetworkTrafficRules node, an optional element in the service definition file, to specify how roles should communicate with each other. Place limits on which roles can access the internal endpoints of the specific role.  Note that the service definition cannot be altered. 

Enable network security group flow logs and send the logs to an Azure Storage account for auditing. Send the flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic patterns in your Azure tenant. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity, identify hot spots and security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32175.).

**Guidance**: Deploy an Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) with an Application Gateway in front of a Cloud service (Classic) to protect against application layer attacks. 

Microsoft uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol v1.2 to protect data when itâ€™s traveling between the Cloud service (Classic) and customers. Microsoft datacenters negotiate a TLS connection with client systems that connect to Azure services. TLS provides strong authentication, message privacy, and integrity (enabling detection of message tampering, interception, and forgery), interoperability, algorithm flexibility, and ease of deployment and use.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32176.).

**Guidance**: Azure Cloud implements a multilayer network security to protect its platform services against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The Azure DDoS defense system is part of Azure's continuous monitoring process, which is continually improved through penetration testing. This DDoS defense system is designed to withstand not only attacks from the outside but also from other Azure tenants. 

There are a few different ways to block or deny communication besides platform level protection within Cloud service (Classic):. They are: 

-  Create a startup task to selectively block some specific IP addresses
-  Restrict an Azure web role access to a set of specified IP addresses by modifying your IIS web.config file

Prevent incoming traffic to the default URL or name of your Cloud service (Classic), for example, *.cloudapp.net. Set the host header to a custom DNS name (for example, www.MyCloudService.com), under site binding configuration in the Cloud service (Classic) definition (*.csdef) file.

Configure a DENY Apply to classic subscription administrator assignments. By default, after an internal endpoint is defined, communication can flow from any role to the internal endpoint of a role without any restrictions. To restrict communication, you must add a NetworkTrafficRules element to the ServiceDefinition element in the service definition file.

- [How can I block/disable incoming traffic to the default URL of my cloud service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-connectivity-and-networking-faq?view=vs-2019#how-can-i-blockdisable-incoming-traffic-to-the-default-url-of-my-cloud-service)

### 1.5: Record network packets

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32177.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Network Watcher, network performance monitoring, diagnostic, and analytics service, that allows monitoring of Azure networks. The Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension is a requirement for capturing network traffic on demand, and other advanced functionality on Azure virtual machines. Install the Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension, and turn on NSG flow logs.

Configure flow logging on a network security group. Review details on how to deploy the Network Watcher Virtual Machine extension to an existing VM deployed through the classic deployment model.

- [Configure flow logging on a network security group](../virtual-machines/extensions/network-watcher-linux.md)

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32178.).

**Guidance**: Azure has IPS/IDS in datacenters with physical servers to defend against threats. Customers can deploy third-party security solutions, such as web application firewalls, network firewalls, antimalware, intrusion detection, prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and more based on their requirements. 

Microsoft Antimalware for Azure protects Cloud service (Classic) and virtual machines. Azure's multipronged threat-management approach uses intrusion detection, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack prevention, penetration testing, behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, and machine learning to constantly strengthen its defense and reduce risks.

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32179.).

**Guidance**: Service certificates, which are attached to Cloud service (Classic), enable secure communication to and from the service. 
These certificates are defined in the services' definition and are automatically deployed to the virtual machine that is running an instance of a web role. As an example, for a web role, you can use a service certificate that can authenticate an exposed HTTPS endpoint. 
To update the certificate, it's only necessary to upload a new certificate and change the thumbprint value in the service configuration file.
Also use the TLS 1.2 protocol, most commonly used method of securing data to provide confidentiality and integrity protection. 

Generally, to protect web applications and to secure them against attacks such as OWASP Top 10, you can deploy an Azure Application Gateway for web applications.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32181.).

**Guidance**: Harden your Cloud service configuration and monitor it for changes. The service configuration file specifies the number of role instances to deploy for each role in the service, the values of any configuration settings, and the thumbprints for any certificates associated with a role. 

If the service is part of an Virtual Network, configuration information for the network must be provided in the service configuration file, as well as in the virtual networking configuration file. The default extension for the service configuration file is .cscfg.

Note that Azure Policy is not supported for Cloud service (Classic) for configuration enforcement.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32182.).

**Guidance**: Azure network security groups can be used to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

Within Cloud services (Classic), for individual network security group rules, use the "Description" field to document the rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32183.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Traffic Manager's built-in endpoint monitoring and automatic endpoint failover features. They help you deliver high-availability applications, which are resilient to endpoint and Azure region failures. To configure endpoint monitoring, you must specify certain settings on your Traffic Manager profile.

Gather insight from Activity log, a platform log in Azure, into subscription-level events. It includes such information as when a resource is modified or when a virtual machine is started. View the Activity log in the Azure portal or retrieve entries with PowerShell and CLI. 

Create a diagnostic setting to send the Activity log to Azure Monitor Logs, to Azure Event Hubs to forward outside of Azure, or to Azure Storage for archival. Configure Azure Monitor for notification alerts when critical resources in your service are changed.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32185.).

**Guidance**: Consume streaming data programmatically with Azure Event Hubs. Integrate and send all this data to Azure Sentinel to monitor and review your logs, or use  a third-party SIEM. To configure central security log management, you should configure continuous export of your chosen Security Center data to Azure Event Hubs and set up the appropriate connector for your SIEM. Here are some options for Azure Sentinel including third party tools:

- Azure Sentinel - Use the native Security Center alerts data connector

- Splunk - Use the Azure Monitor add-on for Splunk

-  IBM QRadar - Use a manually configured log source

-  ArcSight â€“ Use SmartConnector

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32186.).

**Guidance**: Use Visual Studio to set up Azure Diagnostics for troubleshooting Cloud service (Classic) which captures system and logging data on the virtual machines and virtual machine instances running your Cloud service (Classic). The Diagnostics data is transferred to a storage account of your choice. Turn on diagnostics in Cloud service (Classic) projects before their deployment.

 
View the Change history for some events in the activity log within Azure Monitor. Audit  what changes happened during an event time period. Choose an event from the Activity Log for deeper inspection with Change history (Preview) tab. Send the diagnostic data to Application Insights when you publish a Cloud service (Classic) from Visual Studio. Create the Application Insights Azure resource at that time or send the data to an existing Azure resource. 

The Cloud service (Classic) can be monitored by Application Insights for availability, performance, failures, and usage. Custom charts can be added to Application Insights so that you can see the data that matters the most. Role instance data can be collected by using the Application Insights SDK in your Cloud service (Classic) project.

### 2.5: Configure security log storage retention

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32188.).

**Guidance**: You can use advanced monitoring with Cloud service (Classic) which allows for additional metrics are sampled and collected at intervals of 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 12 hours. The aggregated data is stored in a storage account, in tables, and is purged after 10 days. However, the storage account used is configured by role and you can use different storage accounts for different roles. This is configured with a connection string in the .csdef and .cscfg files.

Note that Advanced monitoring involves using the Azure Diagnostics extension (Application Insights SDK is optional) on the role you want to monitor. The diagnostics extension uses a config file (per role) named diagnostics.wadcfgx to configure the diagnostics metrics monitored. The Azure Diagnostic extension collects and stores data in an Azure Storage account. These settings are configured in the .wadcfgx, .csdef, and .cscfg files.

### 2.6: Monitor and review Logs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32189.).

**Guidance**: Basic or advanced monitoring modes are available for Cloud service (Classic). Cloud service automatically collects basic monitoring data (CPU percentage, network in/out, and disk read/write) from a host virtual machine. View the collected monitoring data on the overview and metrics pages of the cloud service in the Azure portal. 

Enable diagnostics in Cloud services (Classic) to collect diagnostic data like application logs, performance counters, and more, while using the Azure Diagnostics extension. Enable or update diagnostics configuration on a Cloud Service that is already running with Set-AzureServiceDiagnosticsExtension cmdlet or deploy a Cloud service with diagnostics extension automatically. Optionally, install the Application Insights SDK. Send performance counters to Azure Monitor.

The Azure Diagnostic extension collects and stores data in an Azure Storage account. Transfer Diagnostic data to the Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator or to Azure Storage as it is not permanently stored. Once in storage, it can be viewed with one of several available tools, such as Server Explorer in Visual Studio, Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, Azure Management Studio. Configure the diagnostics metrics to be monitored with a config file (per role) named diagnostics.wadcfgx in the diagnostics extension.

## Identity and access control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and access control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32194.).

**Guidance**: Microsoft recommends that you manage access to Azure resources using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). 
However, Cloud service (Classic) doesn't support the role-based access control (RBAC) model, as it's not an Azure Resource Manager based service and you have to use a classic subscription

By default, Account Administrator, Service Administrator, and Co-Administrator are the three classic subscription administrator roles in Azure. 
Classic subscription administrators have full access to the Azure subscription. They can manage resources using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager APIs, and the classic deployment model APIs. The account that is used to sign up for Azure is automatically set as both the Account Administrator and Service Administrator. Additional Co-Administrators can be added later. 

The Service Administrator and the Co-Administrators have equivalent access of users who have been assigned the Owner role (an Azure role) at the subscription scope. Manage Co-Administrators or view the Service Administrator by using the Classic administrators tab at the Azure portal. 

List role assignments for classic service administrator and coadministrators with PowerShell with this command:

Get-AzRoleAssignment -IncludeClassicAdministrators

## Data protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data protection](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-protection.md).*

### 4.1: Maintain an inventory of sensitive Information

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32207.).

**Guidance**: Use the Cloud services REST APIs to inventory your Cloud service (Classic) resources for sensitive information. They could be used to poll the deployed cloud service resources to get the configuration and .pkg resources.

 Some examples APIs are listed below. It is recommended that customers create a process to assist in tracking sensitive information with these API operations. 
- Get Deployment: The Get Deployment operation returns configuration information, status, and system properties for a deployment.

- Get Package: The Get Package operation retrieves a cloud service package for a deployment and stores the package files in Microsoft Azure Blob storage

- Get Cloud Service Properties: The Get Cloud Service Properties operation retrieves properties for the specified cloud service

Review the Cloud Services REST APIs documentation and create a process for data protection of sensitive information, based on your business requirements.

**Guidance**: Implement isolation using separate subscriptions and management groups for individual security domains such as environment type and data sensitivity level for Cloud service (classic)

You can also edit the "permissionLevel" in the Cloud service (Classic)'s Certificate element to specify the access permissions given to the role processes. If you want only elevated processes to be able to access the private key, then specify elevated permission. limitedOrElevated permission allows all role processes to access the private key. Possible values are limitedOrElevated or elevated. The default value is limitedOrElevated.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32210.).

**Guidance**: Configure TLS for Cloud service (Classic) in Azure. Use the Azure portal to add the certificate to your staged Cloud service (Classic) and add the certificate information to your Cloud service (Classic)' CSDEF and CSCFG files, repackage your application, and update your staged deployment to use the new package. 

Use service certificates in Azure which are attached to Cloud service (Classic) to enable secure communication to and from the service.
Provide a certificate that can authenticate an exposed HTTPS endpoint. Define Service certificates in the Cloud service (Classic)'s service definition and automatically deploy them to the virtual machine that is running an instance of your role.

Authenticate with the management API with management certificates). Management certificates allow you to authenticate with the classic deployment model. Many programs and tools (such as Visual Studio or the Azure SDK) use these certificates to automate configuration and deployment of various Azure services. 

For additional reference, the Azure Service Management API provides programmatic access to the Service Management functionality available through the Azure portal. Azure SDK for Python can be used to manage Cloud service (Classic) and storage accounts. The Azure SDK for Python wraps the Service Management API, which is a REST API. All API operations are performed over TLS and mutually authenticated by using X.509 v3 certificates. The management service can be accessed from within a service running in Azure. It also can be accessed directly over the Internet from any application that can send an HTTPS request and receive an HTTPS response.
