summary: |
  Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud identity service that allows developers to build apps that sign in users with a Microsoft work or school account. Azure AD supports building single-tenant line-of-business (LOB) apps as well as multi-tenant apps.

  IMPORTANT: This content is for the older Azure AD v1.0 endpoint, use the Microsoft identity platform for new projects.
