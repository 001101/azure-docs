# Different stages in Mobile Application Development
Microsoft tools and solutions span the multichannel approach and offer solutions that can leverage existing skills, connect to back-end systems on-premises or in the cloud and effectively enable both IT and marketing teams.

Developing mobile apps using Microsoft services, tools, and technologies has the following components:
- **Apps development** - Developers can use client-side technologies to build client apps themselves. With Microsoft technologies, developers can build native native single platform apps using languages like Objective-C and Java, cross-platform apps using Xamarin, React Native, Unity, and hybrid using Cordova.

Developers building client front ends can make use of IDEs and code editors, such as Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio, or Visual Studio Code on PCs and Macs, to construct their client apps.

- **Plan and design with back-end services** - Microsoft provides variery of services for setting up a secure, scalable, and reliable back-end for your mobile application. Developers can create serverless APIs and triggers without having to maintain their own servers. They can leverage services, such as push notification, data sync online/offline,and authentication, and a data platform, which together form a comprehensive and expansive mobile back end as a service that supports a variety of app construction scenarios. Building a backend service has multiple reqirements:
    - Limit on storing data on the device.
    - Synchronize data across multiple devices.
    - Making sure the application runs without network connectivity. 
    - Send notifications to users.
    - Reduce battery consumption.
    - Build scalable, reliable, and secure back-end.
    - Automatic server maintainence.

- **DevOps and continuous monitoring** - Developers creating mobile back ends and client front ends can leverage continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous monitoring services to produce native builds for all platforms, run UI automation tests on thousands of physical devices, automated their releases through beta testing channels or deploy directly to app store. In addition, they can gather usage analytics, crash and exception information for their apps.


6 CHAPTER 1 | MADP overview
Developers can create mobile and cloud-focused DevOps for a fast, iterative process that covers continuous integration (CI) delivery, continuous delivery CD, and release management (RM). Developers can produce native builds for all platforms and can run unit tests and UI automation—including against emulators or real devices in the cloud—using
