# Analyze and understand usage of your mobile application 
How well do you understand how your users use your apps? How many active users does your app have and how is usage changing over time? What features are they using and which ones are used the most? Where are these users based? How many users are using the latest version of the application? All these questions are important to understand to turn your app into a successful business. To answer those kinds of usage analytics questions, you need to collect usage data from your apps.

The more you drill down into the data, the more you could find ways to improve your app and keep your users happy. It's important to use data to find actionable insights and do the right thing for users.

## Importance of leveraging Analytics for mobile apps

- **Track** your usage metrics to make informed decisions on how to market your app and better serve your customer
- **Measure** your app performance
- **Learn** which parts of your app drives value and app performance
- **Data-driven insights** into issues concerning churn and retention
