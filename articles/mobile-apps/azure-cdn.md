# Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)

[Azure CDN](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cdn/) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached and lets you reduce load times, save bandwidth, and speed responsiveness—whether you’re developing or managing websites or mobile apps, or encoding and distributing streaming media, gaming software, firmware updates, or IoT endpoints.

## Azure CDN Features
- Works **seamlessly** with Azure services, including Web Apps, Media Services, Storage, and Cloud Services
- Easily **handle traffic spikes and heavy loads**
- **Integration with Akamai and Verizon** to  build and tailor content delivery strategy
- Dynamic site acceleration
- Control Azure CDN caching behavior with **caching rules**
- HTTPS **custom domain support**
- **Azure diagnostics logs** to view core analytics and export them to Blob Storage, Event Hubs or Azure Monitor
- Improve performance by **compressing files**
- **Geo-filtering** to restrict Azure CDN content by country/region
