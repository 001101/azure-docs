# Cloud Hosted Source Code Management Services
If you have development teams with multiple team members working on the same code base, you need to find a suitable place to host your code. Storing the data in the cloud and having a centralized repository allows everyone to upload, edit and manage the code files, interact with other developers on projects, and provides the ability for the code to be readily accessible no matter where you are, as long as you have an internet connection.

Cloud hosting is much easier than on-premises options as it requires less hardware configuration and allows organizations to complete the implementation process in a more agile manner.

## Benefits of hosting source code in the cloud
- **Centralized cloud storage** to view and manage your data from anywhere.
- Enables **better collaboration and cleaner code** within teams to keep track of code and manage projects to ensure the continuous delivery of excellent software.
- **Get involved** and makes it **easy to contribute** to your projects.
- **Faster release cycle** as your team can work faster and **easily to contribute** to your projects.
- **Reduce the cost** without having to worry about maintaining your own hardware, servers, VPN and so on.
