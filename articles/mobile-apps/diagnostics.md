# Monitoring your mobile application for Crashes and Errors
Once your application is in the wild and in use by thousands of users, it is bound to have bugs and believe it or not, your users might run into unexpected app crashes once in a while. From the user perspective, all they want is a working and reliable app. Applications that are buggy and crashes don't provide a good user experience and as a result, disappointed users will uninstall the app, leave a bad review, or publicly criticize and complain about your app.  

Therefore, understanding real-world crash behavior is essential for mobile applications. Your job as a developer is not complete as soon as you release your application testers or to the App Store. It is just as important to continuously monitor and measure the performance in order to ensure app stability and maintain user satisfaction. What you really need is a way to monitor your application and understand what went wrong so you can spend your time prioritizing and fixing issues that are critical for your business needs.

- Find the root cause and reasons why and where the crash occurred on users device.
- Be proactive to triage issues and resolve crashes to make your application stable.
- Build better apps and iterate faster to provide a great user experience so that users come back to using your app.
