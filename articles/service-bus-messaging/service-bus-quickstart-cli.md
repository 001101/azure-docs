# Send and receive messages using Azure CLI

Microsoft Azure Service Bus is an enterprise integration message broker that provides secure messaging and absolute reliability. A typical Service Bus scenario usually involves decoupling two or more applications, services or processes from each other, and transferring state or data changes. Such scenarios might involve scheduling multiple batch jobs in another application or services, or triggering order fulfillment. For example, a retail company might send their point of sales data to a back office or regional distribution center for replenishment and inventory updates. In this scenario, the workflow sends to and receives messages from a Service Bus queue.

This quickstart describes how to send and receive messages with Service Bus, using Azure CLI to create a messaging namespace and a queue within that namespace, and obtain the authorization credentials on that namespace.

If you do not have an Azure subscription, create a [free account][] before you begin.

## Launch Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly from within the Azure portal. It has the Azure CLI preinstalled and configured to use with your account. Click **Cloud Shell** on the upper right menu in the Azure portal.

This option launches an interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article.

## Install CLI locally

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you run the latest version of Azure CLI (2.0.14 or later). To find the version, run the `cli az –version` command. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0][].

1. Once CLI is installed, open a command prompt and issue the following command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az extension add --source https://prodsbclipackages.blob.core.windows.net/cliextensions/servicebus-0.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
   ```

2. Run the following command to log in to Azure:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az login
   ```
   This command displays the following text:

   ```shell
   To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code ######## to authenticate.
   ```

3. Open the https://aka.ms/devicelogin link in the browser and enter the code to authenticate your Azure login. 

## Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical collection of Azure resources. All resources are deployed and managed in a resource group. Create a new resource group with [az group create][] command.

The following example creates a resource group named **serviceBusResourceGroup** in the **East US** region

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name serviceBusResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## Create a Service Bus namespace

A Service Bus messaging namespace provides a unique scoping container, referenced by its [fully qualified domain name][], in which you create one or more queues, topics, and subscriptions. The following example creates a namespace in your resource group. Replace `<namespace_name>` with a unique name for your namespace:

```azurecli-interactive
az servicebus namespace create --name <namespace_name> -location eastus
```

## Create a queue

To create a Service Bus queue, specify the namespace under which you want it created. The following example shows how to create a queue:

```azurecli-interactive
az servicebus entity create --name <queue_name> -location eastus
```

## Get the connection string

You need the namespace-level connection string in order to perform operations on the messaging entities within that namespace. To obtain the connection string, run the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az servicebus TBD
```

Copy and paste the **PrimaryConnectionString** value to a temporary location, such as Notepad, to use later.

## Send and receive messages

After the namespace and queue are provisioned, and you have the necessary credentials, you are ready to send and receive messages.

1. Navigate to [this GitHub sample folder](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus/tree/master/samples/DotNet/GettingStarted/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus/BasicSendReceiveUsingQueueClient), and load the **BasicSendReceiveUsingQueueClient.csproj** file into Visual Studio.
2. Double-click **Program.cs** to open it in the Visual Studio editor.
3. Replace the value of the `ServiceBusConnectionString` constant with the full connection string you obtained in the [previous section](#get-the-connection-string).
4. Replace the value of `QueueName` with the name of the queue you [created previously](#create-a-queue).
5. Build and run the program, and observe 10 messages being sent to the queue, and received in parallel from the queue.

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, namespace, and all related resources:

```azurecli-interactive
TBD
```
