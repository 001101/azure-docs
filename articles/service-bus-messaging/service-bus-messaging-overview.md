# What is Azure Service Bus?

Microsoft Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise integration message broker. Service Bus is most commonly used to decouple applications and services from each other, and provides a highly reliable and secure platform for asynchronous data and state transfer. Data is transferred between different applications and services, commonly called *endpoints*, via *messages*. A message can contain text (including JSON and XML) as well as binary data. You can think of messages as data packages. 

Some common Service Bus messaging scenarios are:

* Transferring business data, such as sales or purchase orders, journals or inventory movements.
* Improving reliability and scalability of applications and services through decoupling (client and service do not have to be online at the same time).
* Enable 1:*n* relationships between publishers and subscribers.

## Queues

Messages sent to and received from the message broker are stored in *queues*. Queues enable you to store messages until the receiving application is available to receive and process them.

Messages in queues are ordered, and Service Bus applies a timestamp on arrival. Once accepted, the message is held safely in redundant, triple replicated storage, with intra-region disaster recovery backups.

### Delivery modes

Queues have two delivery modes: *pull* and *forward*.

* [Pull](service-bus-quickstart-powershell.md) – delivers messages on request.
* [Forward](service-bus-auto-forwarding.md) – delivers a message to a single forwarding destination.

## Topics

You can also use *topics* to send and receive messages. While a queue is often used for point-to-point communication, topics are useful in publish/subscribe scenarios.

![Topic](./media/service-bus-messaging-overview/about-service-bus-topic.png)

Topics can have multiple, independent subscriptions. A subscriber to a topic is eligible to receive a copy of each message sent to that topic. Subscriptions are named entities, which are durably created but can optionally expire or auto-delete.

In some scenarios you may not want individual subscriptions to receive all messages sent to a topic. If so, you can use [rules and filters](topic-filters.md) to define conditions that trigger optional actions, filter specified messages, and set or modify message properties.

## Advanced features

Service Bus has advanced features, discussed in the next section, that enable you to solve more complex messaging problems. For example, Service Bus supports enforcing first in, first out (FIFO) receiving via [sessions](message-sessions.md), chaining multiple entities with [auto-forwarding](service-bus-auto-forwarding.md), or [dead-letter queues](service-bus-dead-letter-queues.md) if messages cannot be processed for any reason. 

## Key Service Bus features

The following list summarizes some advanced features supported by Azure Service Bus:

### Scheduled delivery

If [absolute order of messages](message-sequencing.md) is significant, or a consumer needs a trustworthy unique identifier for messages, the message broker stamps messages with a gap-free, increasing sequence number relative to the queue or topic. For partitioned entities, the sequence number is issued relative to the partition.

### Dead-lettering

Service Bus supports a [dead-letter queue](service-bus-dead-letter-queues.md) (DLQ) to hold messages that cannot be delivered to any receiver, or messages that cannot be processed. Messages can then be removed from the DLQ and inspected. An application might, with the help of an operator, correct issues and resubmit the message, log the fact that there was an error, and take corrective action.

### Auto-forwarding

The [auto-forwarding](service-bus-auto-forwarding.md) feature enables you to chain a queue or subscription to another queue or topic that is part of the same namespace. When auto-forwarding is enabled, Service Bus automatically removes messages that are placed in the first queue or subscription (source) and puts them in the second queue or topic (destination).

### Message deferral

When a queue or subscription client receives a message that it is willing to process, but for which processing is not currently possible due to special circumstances within the application, the entity has the option to [defer retrieval of the message](message-deferral.md) to a later point. The message remains in the queue or subscription, but it is set aside.

### Message sessions

To realize a FIFO guarantee in Service Bus, use sessions. [Message sessions](message-sessions.md) enable joint and ordered handling of unbounded sequences of related messages. 

### Batching

[Client-side batching](service-bus-performance-improvements.md#client-side-batching) enables a queue or topic client to delay sending a message for a certain period of time. If the client sends additional messages during this time period, it transmits the messages in a single batch. Batching does not affect the number of billable messaging operations, and is available only for the Service Bus client protocol. The HTTP protocol does not support batching.

### Transactions

A [transaction](service-bus-transactions.md) groups two or more operations together into an execution scope. Service Bus supports grouping operations against a single messaging entity (queue, topic, subscription) within the scope of a transaction. For example, you can send several messages to one queue from within a transaction scope, and the messages will only be committed to the queue's log when the transaction successfully completes.

## Integration

Service Bus also supports the following integration features:

* [Filtering and Actions](topic-filters.md)
* [Auto-delete on idle](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.subscriptiondescription.autodeleteonidle?view=azure-dotnet#Microsoft_ServiceBus_Messaging_SubscriptionDescription_AutoDeleteOnIdle)
* [Duplicate detection](duplicate-detection.md)
* [SAS](service-bus-sas.md), [RBAC](service-bus-role-based-access-control.md) and [MSI](service-bus-managed-service-identity.md) support.
* [Geo-Recovery](service-bus-geo-dr.md)
* Secure, standard [AMQP 1.0](service-bus-amqp-overview.md) and [HTTP/REST](/rest/api/servicebus/) protocols
* Client libraries for [.NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-dotnet/tree/master), [Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-java/tree/master), [JMS](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus/tree/master/samples/Java/qpid-jms-client) support
