# Tutorial: update inventory assortment using topics and subscriptions

Microsoft Azure Service Bus is a multi-tenant cloud messaging service that sends information between applications and services. Asynchronous operations give you flexible, brokered messaging, along with structured first-in, first-out (FIFO) messaging, and publish/subscribe capabilities.

This tutorial describes how to use Service Bus topics, subscriptions, and publish/subscribe channels to enable a retail scenario that updates an inventory assortment and sends a set of messages from the back office to the stores. The workflow is pictured in the following figure:
