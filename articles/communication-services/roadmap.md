# Roadmap

## Features under development

This feature list is a peek into our roadmap. It identifies some of the significant features we are currently working on and a rough timeframe for when you can expect to see them. It is not comprehensive but is intended to provide some visibility into key investments.

These features and dates are the current plans at this time and are subject to change. The "Area" column reflects the area of the product the feature aligns with most, and "State"  indicates if the feature will be in public preview or generally available.
