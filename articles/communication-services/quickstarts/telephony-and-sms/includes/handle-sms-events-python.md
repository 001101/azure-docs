## Send a SMS message and enable Delivery Reports

To enable Delivery Report on an SMS we will add send options, specifically `enableDeliveryReport` to it. For more information sending SMS, see [here](../send-sms.md)

1. Adding `send options` to our send method with `enableDeliveryReport` set to `true`
2. On success, the send method will return a `MessageId` which we can use to correlate with the `DeliveryReport` sent to `Event Grid`.

```python
// todo
```
