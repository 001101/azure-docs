# Quickstart: Buy a phone number using the Azure portal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Communication Services is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).


Before proceeding, please review the [Plan your telephony and SMS solution](./plan-your-telephony-and-sms-solution.md) quickstart.

The wizard on the "Phone number" portal will walk you through a series of questions to define the right choice of numbers for your scenario.
When you start selecting the number, you define the ["Number Type"](./plan-your-telephony-and-sms-solution.md#phone-number-types-in-microsoft-direct-offer/) and select ["Plans"](./plan-your-telephony-and-sms-solution.md#plans/) appropriately for your project.

You can pick a toll-free number, enable one way inbound calling on it and two way SMS, or select the same toll-free number as the caller ID (what users see when you call them from your ACS application) for outbound calling.
On the next step, the wizard will ask you for the purpose of using the number. We collect the purpose of using the phone numbers to apply the right taxes and emergency calling regulations.

And, lastly, you need to provide the address where the number will be used. We collect this information per regulatory requirements

The next screen will present the list of available numbers and prices for renting the number.

To make or receive calls or send/receive SMS messages you need to consider two prices:
- Monthly recurring charge for the selected phone number. This is a fee for the number renting
- Cost to make or receive calls, based on pay as you go model. The price lists available here [LINK] Calling prices depend on number type and destination called. For example, price per minute for a call from a Seattle regional number to a regional number in New York and a call from the same number to a UK mobile number may be different.

On the last screen, you will see the price, tax information and can complete your order
