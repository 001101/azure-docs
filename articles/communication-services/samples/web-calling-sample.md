# Get started with the web calling sample

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../includes/public-preview-include.md)]

[!IMPORTANT]
[The Web Calling sample can be found here in Github](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-web-calling-tutorial/). Follow the README in the repo to set up and run the Web Calling Tutorial locally on your machine.

# Overview
The Web Calling Tutorial project is a front end application client which is a step-by-step walkthrough of the different major calling functionalities provided by the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK for JavaScript. Each section has a "Show code" button which shows the code for the different functionalities.

Upon successfully setting up and running the [Web Calling Tutorial project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-web-calling-tutorial), the main landing web page of the tutorial will look like this:
