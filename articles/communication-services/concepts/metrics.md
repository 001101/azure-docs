## Where to find Metrics

Chat and SMS services in Azure Communication Services emit metrics for API requests. These metrics can be found in the Metrics blade under your ACS resource. You can also create permanent dashboards using the workbooks blade under your ACS resource.

## Metric definitions
Chat API Requests - Count of all API requests to ACS chat gateway endpoint.

SMS API Requests - Count of all API requests to ACS SMS gateway endpoint.

### ChatAPIRequests

The Chat API request metric contains three dimension to filter on. The dimensions can be aggregated together using count and supports all standard Azure Aggregation time series.

Operation - All operations or routes that can be called on the ACS Chat gateway.
Status Code - The status code response sent after the request.
StatusSubClass - The status code series sent after the response. 

The list below are the possible operations or route values that can be returned by the Chat API request metric. If a request is made to a route that is not recognized, you will receive a "Bad Route" value for Operation.

Operation – (All routes) - GetChatMessage, ListChatMessages, SendChatMessage, UpdateChatMessage, DeleteChatMessage, GetChatThread, ListChatThreads, UpdateChatThread,  CreateChatThread, DeleteChatThread, GetReadReceipts, SendTypingIndicator, ListChatThreadParticipants, AddChatThreadParticipants and RemoveChatThreadParticipant.
