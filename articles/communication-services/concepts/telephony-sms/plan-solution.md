# Plan your telephony and SMS solution

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]


In this document, we'll review the decision flows that you can use to select phone number types, plans, and capabilities made available through Azure Communication Services.

## About phone numbers in Azure Communications Services

Azure Communication Services allows you to use phone numbers to place and receive telephony calls and SMS messages. These phone numbers can be used to configure caller ID for outbound calls placed by your service.
  
The simplest way to begin is to get a new phone number from Azure Communication Services in a matter of minutes.

The following diagram can be used to determine the type of phone number that you'll select:

Now, let's review the phone number types and capabilities available through Communication Services. 

## Microsoft direct offer of phone numbers and capabilities

Azure Communication Services provides excellent flexibility for developers. On most phone numbers, we allow you to configure an "a la carte" set of plans. Some developers only need an inbound calling plan; some might opt for inbound calling and outbound SMS plans. These plans can be selected as you lease and/or port your telephone numbers within Communication Services.

The plans that are available to you depend on the country that you're operating within, your use case, and the phone number type that you've selected:

Before you can select a phone number type, let’s review the international phone numbering plan.

### Optional reading. International public telecommunication numbering plan (E.164)

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend reviewing this information even if you are familiar with the E.164 phone numbering plan to better understand the number types and capabilities offered by Azure Communication Services direct offer.

The international public telecommunication numbering plan is defined in The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendation E.164. Conforming numbers are limited to a maximum of 15 digits.

The phone number consists of

-	A prefix “+”
-	An international dialing prefix or country/region code (one, two or three digits) 
-	*(Optional)* A national destination code or numbering plan, commonly referred to as an area code. The length of this code depends on the country. In the United States, it's three digits. In Australia and New Zealand, it's one digit. Germany, Japan, Mexico, and some other countries have variable lengths of the area codes. For example, in Germany, the area code can be anywhere from two to five digits, while in Japan it can be anywhere from one to five digits.
-	A subscriber number

> [!NOTE]
> The classification above does not fully conform to the ITU E.164 standard and intended to provide a simplified description. For example, the subscriber number is subdivided within the standard. If you're interested in learning about the international numbering plan more deeply, the [ITU E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164) is an excellent place to start.  

Here are some examples that will help you better understand the numbering plan:

Next, let's review specific phone number types available in Azure Communication Services.

## Phone number types in Azure Communication Services

Microsoft offers regional and toll-free plans for numbers in US.

The table below summarizes these phone number types: 

| Phone number type | Example                              | Country availability    | Phone Number Capability |Common use case                                                                                                     |
