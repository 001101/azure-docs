# SMS concepts

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]


Azure Communication Services enables you to send and receive SMS text messages using the Communication Services SMS client libraries. These client libraries can be used to support customer service scenarios, appointment reminders, two-factor authentication, and other real-time communication needs. Communication Services SMS allows you to reliably send messages while exposing deliverability and response rate insights surrounding your campaigns.

## SMS client library capabilities

Key features of Azure Communication Services SMS client libraries include:

| |
| ------------ |
| **Simple** setup experience for adding SMS capability to your applications.  |
| **High Velocity** message support over toll free numbers for A2P (Application to Person) use cases in the United States. |
| **Two-way** conversations to support scenarios like customer support, alerts, and appointment reminders.|
| **Reliable Delivery** with real-time delivery reports for messages sent from your application. |
| **Analytics** to track your usage patterns and customer engagement. |
| **Opt-Out** handling support to automatically detect and respect opt-outs for toll-free numbers. Communication Services detects STOP and START messages and sends the following default responses to end-users: <br><br>- STOP - *"You have successfully been unsubscribed to messages from this number. Reply START to resubscribe."*<br>- START- *“You have successfully been re-subscribed to messages from this number. Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”*<br>- The STOP and START messages will be relayed back to you. Azure Communication Services requires you to monitor and implement these opt-outs and ensure that no further messages are sent to recipients who have opted out of your communications.|
| **Verified Toll-Free numbers** Communication Services can get your SMS content verified by carriers to avoid clean traffic from getting blocked. *Please email us your Communication Services configured toll-free number along with sample SMS use cases at SMSRequest@microsoft.com to get your content verified.*|
