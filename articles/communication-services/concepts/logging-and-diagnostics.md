## Enable diagnostic logs in your resource

Logging is turned off by default when a a resource is created, and you'll need to go into the resource to enable it. 

Navigate to the **Diagnostic settings** blade in the resource menu under the **Monitoring** section. Then click on **Add diagnostic setting**. 

Next, select the archive target you want. Currently, we support Archive to a storage account and Send to Log Analytics. Now choose the type of logs you wish to enable, and save the diagnostic settings.
 
New settings take effect in about 10 minutes. After that, logs appear in the configured archival target, in the Logs pane.

For more information about configuring diagnostics, see the overview of [Azure resource logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/platform-logs-overview).

## Resource Log categories

Communication Services has three types of logs you can enable:
* **Usage logs** - shows the usage for each service offering
* **Chat operational logs** - shows basic information related to the chat service
* **SMS operational logs** - shows basic information related to the SMS service

### Usage logs schema

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ---------------|
| Timestamp | The timestamp (UTC) of when the log was generated. |
| Operation Name | The operation associated with log record. |
| Operation Version | The api-version associated with the operation, if the operationName was performed using an API. If there is no API that corresponds to this operation, the version represents the version of that operation in case the properties associated with the operation change in the future. |
| Category | The log category of the event. Category is the granularity at which you can enable or disable logs on a particular resource. The properties that appear within the properties blob of an event are the same within a particular log category and resource type. |
| Correlation ID | The ID for correlated events. Can be used to identify correlated events between multiple tables. |
| Properties | Other data applicable to various modes of Communication Services. |
| Record ID | The unique id for a given usage record. |
| Usage Type | The mode of usage. (e.g. Chat, PSTN, NAT, etc.) |
| Unit Type | The type of unit that usage is based off for a given mode of usage. (e.g. minutes, MegaBytes, messages, etc.). |
| Quantity | The number of units used or consumed for this record. |

### Chat operational logs

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ---------------|
| TimeGenerated | The timestamp (UTC) of when the log was generated. |
| OperationName | The operation associated with log record. |
| CorrelationID | The ID for correlated events. Can be used to identify correlated events between multiple tables. |
| OperationVersion | The api-version associated with the operation, if the operationName was performed using an API. If there is no API that corresponds to this operation, the version represents the version of that operation in case the properties associated with the operation change in the future. |
| Category | The log category of the event. Category is the granularity at which you can enable or disable logs on a particular resource. The properties that appear within the properties blob of an event are the same within a particular log category and resource type. |
| ResultType | The status of the operation. |
| ResultSignature | The sub status of the operation. If this operation corresponds to a REST API call, this field is the HTTP status code of the corresponding REST call. |
| ResultDescription | The static text description of this operation. |
| DurationMs | The duration of the operation in milliseconds. |
| CallerIpAddress | The caller IP address, if the operation corresponds to an API call that would come from an entity with a publicly available IP address. |
| Level | The severity level of the event. |
| URI | The URI of the request. |
| UserId | The request sender's user id. |
| ChatThreadId | The chat thread id associated with the request. |
| ChatMessageId | The chat message id associated with the request. |
| SdkType | The Sdk type used in the request. |
| PlatformType | The platform type used in the request. |

### SMS operational logs

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ---------------|
| TimeGenerated | The timestamp (UTC) of when the log was generated. |
| OperationName | The operation associated with log record. |
| CorrelationID | The ID for correlated events. Can be used to identify correlated events between multiple tables. |
| OperationVersion | The api-version associated with the operation, if the operationName was performed using an API. If there is no API that corresponds to this operation, the version represents the version of that operation in case the properties associated with the operation change in the future. |
| Category | The log category of the event. Category is the granularity at which you can enable or disable logs on a particular resource. The properties that appear within the properties blob of an event are the same within a particular log category and resource type. |
| ResultType | The status of the operation. |
| ResultSignature | The sub status of the operation. If this operation corresponds to a REST API call, this field is the HTTP status code of the corresponding REST call. |
| ResultDescription | The static text description of this operation. |
| DurationMs | The duration of the operation in milliseconds. |
| CallerIpAddress | The caller IP address, if the operation corresponds to an API call that would come from an entity with a publicly available IP address. |
| Level | The severity level of the event. |
| URI | The URI of the request. |
| OutgoingMessageLength | The number of characters in the outgoing message. |
| IncomingMessageLength | The number of characters in the incoming message. |
| DeliveryAttempts | "The number of attempts made to deliver this message. |
| PhoneNumber | The phone number the SMS message is being sent to. |
| SdkType | The Sdk type used in the request. |
| PlatformType | The platform type used in the request. |
| Method | The method used in the request. |
