# Compare Azure Communication Services

There are two other Microsoft communication products you may consider leveraging that are not directly interoperable with ACS at this time:

 - [Microsoft Graph Cloud Communication APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/cloud-communications-concept-overview) allow organizations to build communication experiences tied to Azure Active Directory users with M365 licenses. This is ideal for applications tied to AAD or where you want to extend productivity experiences in Microsoft Teams. There are also APIs to build applications and customization within the [Teams experience.](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/?view=msteams-client-js-latest)

 - [Azure PlayFab Party](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/networking/) simplifies adding low-latency chat and data communication to games. While you can power gaming chat and networking systems with ACS, PlayFab is a tailored option and free on Xbox.
