# Secure an Azure API Management API with Azure AD B2C

In this article, you learn how to secure an API in Azure API Management by using Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C). By creating an inbound policy in Azure API Management (APIM) that verifies the audience and issuer claims in an Azure AD B2C-issued access token, you can ensure that only API calls with a valid token are accepted.

## Prerequisites

You need the following resources in place before continuing with the steps in this article:

* [Azure AD B2C tenant](tutorial-create-tenant.md)
* [Application registered](tutorial-register-applications.md) in your tenant
* [User flows created](tutorial-create-user-flows.md) in your tenant
* [Published API](../api-management/import-and-publish.md) in Azure API Management

## Get Azure AD B2C application ID

When you secure an API in Azure API Management with Azure AD B2C, you need several values for the inbound policy that you create in APIM. First, record the application ID of an application you've previously created in your Azure AD B2C tenant. If you're using the application you created in the prerequisites, use the application ID for *webbapp1*.

1. Browse to your Azure AD B2C tenant in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Under **Manage**, select **Applications**
1. Record the value in the **APPLICATION ID** for *webapp1* or another application you've previously created.

## Get token issuer endpoint

Next, get the well-known config URL for one of your Azure AD B2C user flows. You also need the token issuer endpoint URI for the issuer you want to support in Azure API Management.

1. Browse to your Azure AD B2C tenant in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Under **Policies**, select **User flows (policies)**
1. Select an existing policy, for example *B2C_1_signupsignin1*, then select **Run user flow**
1. Record the URL in hyperlink displayed under the **Run user flow** heading near the top of the page. This URL is the OpenID Connect well-known discovery endpoint for the user flow, and you use it in the next section when you configure the inbound policy in Azure API Management.

    ![Well-known URI hyperlink in the Run now page of the Azure portal](media/secure-apim-with-b2c-token/portal-01-policy-link.png)

1. Select the hyperlink to browse to the OpenID Connect well-known configuration page.
1. In the page that opens in your browser, record the `issuer` value, for example:

    `https://your-b2c-tenant.b2clogin.com/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/v2.0/`

    You use this value in the next section when you configure your API in Azure API Management.

You should now have two URLs recorded for use in the next section: the OpenID Connect well-known configuration endpoint URL and the issuer URI. For example:

```
https://yourb2ctenant.b2clogin.com/yourb2ctenant.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?p=B2C_1_signupsignin1
https://yourb2ctenant.b2clogin.com/99999999-0000-0000-0000-999999999999/v2.0/
```

## Configure validation in Azure API Management

You're now ready to add the inbound policy in Azure API Management that validates API calls. By adding an inbound policy that verifies the audience and issuer in an access token, you can ensure that only API calls with a valid token are accepted.

1. Browse to your Azure API Management instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Select **APIs**
1. Select the API that you want to secure with Azure AD B2C
1. Select the **Design** tab
1. Under **Inbound processing**, select **\</\>** to open the policy code editor
1. Place the following `<validate-jwt>` tag inside the `<inbound>` policy.

    1. Update the `url` value in the `<openid-config>` tag with your policy's well-known configuration URL.
    1. Update the `aud` value with Application ID of the application you created previously in your B2C tenant (for example, *webapp1*).
    1. Update the `iss` value with the token issuer endpoint you recorded earlier.

    ```xml
    <policies>
        <inbound>
            <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized. Access token is missing or invalid.">
                <openid-config url="https://yourb2ctenant.b2clogin.com/yourb2ctenant.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?p=B2C_1_signupsignin1" />
                <required-claims>
                    <claim name="aud">
                        <value>44444444-0000-0000-0000-444444444444</value>
                    </claim>
                    <claim name="iss">
                        <value>https://yourb2ctenant.b2clogin.com/99999999-0000-0000-0000-999999999999/v2.0/</value>
                    </claim>
                </required-claims>
            </validate-jwt>
            <base />
        </inbound>
        <backend> <base /> </backend>
        <outbound> <base /> </outbound>
        <on-error> <base /> </on-error>
    </policies>
    ```

## Validate Azure API Management configuration

You can validate the API using a tool like Postman. Get the B2C-generated token, then add it to Authorization header when calling the Azure API.

For example, in Postman:

## Enable multiple JWT validation in Azure API Management

You can add multiple JWT validations in Azure API Management. This is useful when you generate tokens using multiple issuer URLs for B2C (for example, `logn.microsoftonline.com` and `b2clogin.com`) to validate against a single API in Azure API Management.

## Migrate an existing API to b2clogin.com

**[TODO: This might go in its own doc that talks about migrating APIM-fronted APIs protected by B2C to b2clogin.com]**

If you previously protected an API in Azure API Management with Azure AD B2C using the `login.microsoftonline.com` issuer endpoint, you should migrate the API to support tokens issued by [b2clogin.com](b2clogin.md). During the migration, you might wish to support both endpoints to continue supporting clients with tokens issued by the legacy `login.microsoftonline.com` endpoint.

To enable support for multiple token issuer domains, use the `<choose>` in your API Management policy tag to enable a branching flow within the policy. To inform the API which condition to validate, modify the `Authorization` header.

For example, this policy enables support for

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <choose>
            <when condition="@(context.Request.Headers.GetValueOrDefault("Domain", "") == "b2clogin.com")">
                <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized. Access token is missing or invalid.">
                    <openid-config url="https://testapimanagement.b2clogin.com/testapimanagement.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?p=B2C_1A_signup_signin" />
                    <required-claims>
                        <claim name="aud">

                        </claim>
                        <claim name="iss">
