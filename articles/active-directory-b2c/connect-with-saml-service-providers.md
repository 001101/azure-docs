# Register a SAML application in Azure AD B2C

In this article, you learn how to configure Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) to act as a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity provider (IdP) to your applications.

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-public-preview](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-public-preview.md)]

## Scenario overview

Organizations that use Azure AD B2C as their customer identity and access management solution might require interaction with identity providers or applications that are configured to authenticate using the SAML protocol.

Azure AD B2C achieves SAML interoperability in one of two ways:

* By acting as an identity provider (IdP) and achieving single-sign-on (SSO) with SAML-based service providers (your applications)
* By acting as a service provider and interacting with SAML-based identity providers like Salesforce and ADFS

![Diagram with B2C as identity provider on left and B2C as service provider on right](media/saml-identity-provider/saml-idp-diagram-01.jpg)

Summarizing the two non-exclusive core scenarios with SAML:

| Scenario | Azure AD B2C role | How-to |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| My application expects a SAML assertion to complete an authentication. | **B2C acts as Identity Provider (IdP)**<br />Azure AD B2C acts as a SAML IdP to the applications. | This article. |
| My users need single-sign-on with a SAML-compliant identity provider like ADFS, Salesforce, or Shibboleth.  | **B2C acts as Service Provider (SP)**<br />Azure AD B2C acts as a service provider when connecting to the SAML identity provider. It's a federation proxy between your application and the SAML identity provider.  | <ul><li>[Set up sign-in with ADFS as a SAML IdP using custom policies](active-directory-b2c-custom-setup-adfs2016-idp.md)</li><li>[Set up sign-in with a Salesforce SAML provider using custom policies](active-directory-b2c-setup-sf-app-custom.md)</li></ul> |

## Prerequisites

* Complete the steps in [Get started with custom policies in Azure AD B2C](active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom.md). You need the *SocialAndLocalAccounts* custom policy from the custom policy starter pack discussed in the article.
* Basic understanding of the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol.
* An application configured as a SAML service provider (SP). For this tutorial, you can use a [SAML test application][samltest] that we provide.

## Components of the solution

There are three main components required for this scenario:

* SAML **application** with the ability to receive, decode, and respond to SAML assertions from Azure AD B2C. This is the relying party.
* Publicly available SAML **metadata endpoint** for your application.
* [Azure AD B2C tenant](tutorial-create-tenant.md)

If you don't yet have a SAML application and an associated metadata endpoint, you can use this sample SAML application that we've made available for testing:

[SAML Test Application][samltest]

## 1. Set up certificates

To build a trust relationship between your relying party application and Azure AD B2C, you need to provide X509 certificates and their private keys:

* Certificate with private key stored in your the Web App. This cert is used to sign the SAML request sent to Azure AD B2C.
* Certificate with private key in Azure AD B2C. This is used to sign and/or encrypt the SAML response that Azure AD B2C returns to the SAML relying party.

You can use a certificate issued by a public certificate authority or, for this tutorial, a self-signed certificate.

### 1.1 Prepare a self-signed certificate

If you don't already have a certificate, you can use a self-signed certificate for this tutorial. On Windows, you can use PowerShell's [New-SelfSignedCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate) cmdlet to generate a certificate.

1. Execute this PowerShell command to generate a self-signed certificate. Modify the `-Subject` argument as appropriate for your application and Azure AD B2C tenant name. You can also adjust the `-NotAfter` date to specify a different expiration for the certificate.

    ```PowerShell
    New-SelfSignedCertificate `
        -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
        -Subject "CN=yourappname.yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com" `
        -KeyAlgorithm RSA `
        -KeyLength 2048 `
        -KeyUsage DigitalSignature `
        -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddMonths(12) `
        -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My"
    ```

1. Open **Manage user certificates** > **Current User** > **Personal** > **Certificates** > *yourappname.yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com*
1. Select the certificate > **Action** > **All Tasks** > **Export**
1. Select **Yes** > **Next** > **Yes, export the private key** > **Next**
1. Accept the defaults for **Export File Format**
1. Provide a password for the certificate

### 1.2 Upload the certificate

Next, upload the certificate to Azure AD B2C.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and browse to your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. Select **Settings** > **Identity Experience Framework** > **Policy Keys**.
1. Select **Add**, and then select **Options** > **Upload**.
1. Enter a **Name**, for example *YourAppNameSamlCert*. The prefix *B2C_1A_* is automatically added to the name of your key.
1. Upload your certificate using the upload file control.
1. Enter the certificate's password.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Verify that the key appears as expected. For example, *B2C_1A_YourAppNameSamlCert*.

## 2. Prepare your policy

### 2.1 Create the SAML token issuer

Now, add the capability for your tenant to issue SAML tokens.

Open `SocialAndLocalAccounts/`**`TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`** in the custom policy starter pack.

Locate the `<ClaimsProviders>` section and add the following XML snippet. Update the `IssuerUri` value with your Azure AD B2C tenant name. This is the issuer URI that is returned in the SAML response from Azure AD B2C. Your relying party application should be configured to accept an issuer URI during SAML assertion validation.

```XML
<ClaimsProvider>
  <DisplayName>Token Issuer</DisplayName>
  <TechnicalProfiles>

    <!-- SAML Token Issuer technical profile -->
    <TechnicalProfile Id="Saml2AssertionIssuer">
      <DisplayName>Token Issuer</DisplayName>
      <Protocol Name="None"/>
      <OutputTokenFormat>SAML2</OutputTokenFormat>
      <Metadata>
        <!-- The issuer contains the policy name, should the same one as configured in the relying party application we will use B2C_1A_signup_wignin_SAML below-->
        <Item Key="IssuerUri">https://tenant-name.b2clogin.com/tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1A_signup_signin_SAML</Item>
      </Metadata>
      <CryptographicKeys>
        <Key Id="MetadataSigning" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_YourAppNameSamlCert"/>
        <Key Id="SamlAssertionSigning" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_YourAppNameSamlCert"/>
        <Key Id="SamlMessageSigning" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_YourAppNameSamlCert"/>
      </CryptographicKeys>
      <InputClaims/>
      <OutputClaims/>
      <UseTechnicalProfileForSessionManagement ReferenceId="SM-Saml"/>
    </TechnicalProfile>

    <!-- Session management technical profile for SAML based tokens -->
    <TechnicalProfile Id="SM-Saml">
      <DisplayName>Session Management Provider</DisplayName>
      <Protocol Name="Proprietary" Handler="Web.TPEngine.SSO.SamlSSOSessionProvider, Web.TPEngine, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"/>
    </TechnicalProfile>

  </TechnicalProfiles>
</ClaimsProvider>
```

### 2.2 Setup the user journey

At this point, you've set up the SAML issuer, but it's not yet available in any of the user journeys. To make it available, create a duplicate of an existing user journey, and then modify it so that it issues a SAML token instead of JWT.

1. Open the *TrustFrameworkBase.xml* file in the *SocialAndLocalAccounts* the starter pack.
1. Copy the entire contents of the `UserJourney` element that includes `Id="SignUpOrSignIn"`.
1. Open the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml* and find the `UserJourneys` element. If the element doesn't exist, add one by adding open and closing element nodes:

    ```XML
    <UserJourneys>

    </UserJourneys>
    ```

1. Paste the contents of the `UserJourney` element that you copied earlier as a child of the `UserJourneys` element.
1. Rename the ID of the `SignUpOrSignIn` user journey to `SignUpSignInSAML`.

    ```XML
    <UserJourneyId="SignUpOrSignInSAML">
    ```

1. In the last orchestration step, change the value of the `CpimIssuerTechnicalProfileReferenceId` property from `JwtIssuer` to `Saml2AssertionIssuer`.

    ```XML
    <OrchestrationStepOrder="4" Type="SendClaims" CpimIssuerTechnicalProfileReferenceId="Saml2AssertionIssuer"/>
    ```

Save your policy and upload it to confirm there are no errors in the policy. You may need to select **Overwrite the custom policy if it already exists**.

## 3. Add the SAML Relying Party policy

Now that your tenant can issue SAML tokens, you need to create the SAML relying party policy.

### 3.1 Create sign-up or sign-in policy

1. Make a copy of the *SignUpOrSignin.xml* file in your starter pack working directory, and name the copy with the ID of the new journey you created. For example,*SignUpOrSigninSAML.xml*. This is your relying party policy file.
1. Open the *SignUpOrSigninSAML.xml* file in your preferred editor.
1. Replace the policy name `B2C_1A_signup_signin` with `B2C_1A_signup_signin_SAML`.
1. Replace the entire `<TechnicalProfile>` element in the `<RelyingParty>` element with the following technical profile XML. Update `tenant-name` with the name of your Azure AD B2C tenant.

    ```XML
    <TechnicalProfile Id="PolicyProfile">
      <DisplayName>PolicyProfile</DisplayName>
      <Protocol Name="SAML2"/>
      <Metadata>
        <Item Key="IssuerUri">https://tenant-name.b2clogin/tenant-name.b2clogin.com/saml_client_d</Item>
      </Metadata>
      <OutputClaims>
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="displayName" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="givenName" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="surname" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="email" DefaultValue="" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="identityProvider" DefaultValue="" />
        <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="objectId" PartnerClaimType="objectId"/>
      </OutputClaims>
      <SubjectNamingInfo ClaimType="objectId" ExcludeAsClaim="true"/>
    </TechnicalProfile>
    ```

### 3.2 Update the metadata

You can configure the metadata in both parties' "Static Metadata" or "Dynamic Metadata." In static mode, you copy the entire metadata from one party and set it in the other party. In dynamic mode, you set the URL to the metadata and other party reads the configuration dynamically. The principle is the same: you provide the Azure B2C policy's metadata in your service provider (relying party), and provide your service provider's metadata to Azure AD B2C.

Each SAML relying party application has different steps to set and read the identity provider metadata, and Azure AD B2C can read the service provider's metadata. Check your relying party application's documentation for guidance on how to set and read the identity provider metadata. You need your relying party applications' metadata URL or XML document to set in the Azure AD B2C relying party policy file.

This example uses dynamic metadata. Update the `<Item>` element with `Key="PartnerEntity"` by adding the URL of the SAML relying party's metadata, if it exists:

```XML
<Item Key="PartnerEntity">https://app.com/metadata</Item>
```

The Service Provider metadata must be available at a publicly accessible endpoint.

> [!TIP]
> If your app is running at https://localhost, you can serve the metadata file from a publicly accessible web server that allows anonymous requests.

### 3.3 Upload and test your policy metadata

Save your changes and upload the new policy file. After you've uploaded both policies (the extension and the relying party), open a web browser and navigate to the policy metadata. The Azure AD B2C policy metadata is available at following URL. Replace `tenant-name` with the name of your Azure AD B2C tenant, and `policy-name` with the name (ID) of the policy:

`https://tenant-name.b2clogin.com/tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/policy-name/Samlp/metadata`

Your custom policy and Azure AD B2C tenant are now ready. Next, create an application registration in Azure AD B2C.

## 4. Setup application in the Azure AD B2C Directory

### 4.1 Register your application in Azure Active Directory

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select the **Directory + subscription** filter in the top menu, and then select the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. In the left menu, select **Azure AD B2C**. Or, select **All services** and search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **App registrations (Preview)**, and then select **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for the application. For example, *SAMLApp1*.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory or any identity provider.**
1. Under **Redirect URI**, select **Web**, and then enter `https://localhost`. You modify this value later in the application registration's manifest.
1. Select **Grant admin consent to openid and offline_access permissions**.
1. Select **Register**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Manifest** to open the manifest editor. You modify several properties in the next section.

### 4.2 Update the app manifest

For SAML apps, there are several properties you need to configure in the application registration's manifest.

#### ReplyUrlWithType (only with type 'Web')

This property represents `AssertionConsumerServiceUrl` (`SingleSignOnService` URL in the R metadata) and the `BindingType` is assumed to be `HTTP POST`.

For this tutorial, in which you use the SAML test application, set the `url` property of `replyUrlsWithType` to the value shown in the following JSON snippet.

```JSON
"replyUrlsWithType":[
  {
    "url":"https://samltestapp2.azurewebsites.net/SP/AssertionConsumer",
    "type":"Web"
  }
],
```

#### LogoutUrl

This property represents the `Logout` URL (`SingleLogoutService` URL in the RP metadata), and the `BindingType` for this is assumed to be `HttpDirect`.

For this tutorial which uses the SAML test application, leave `logoutUrl` set to `null`:

```JSON
"logoutUrl":null,
```

#### SamlMetadataUrl

This property represents RP's publicly available metadata URL. The metadata URL can point to a a metadata file uploaded to any anonymously accessible endpoint, for example blob storage.

For this tutorial which uses the SAML test application, use the following value for `samlMetadataUrl`:

```JSON
"samlMetadataUrl":"https://samltestapp2.azurewebsites.net/Metadata",
```

For more information about the contents of the metadata, see [Metadata for the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf) (PDF), available on the OASIS website.

#### IdentifierUri

This field is used to uniquely identify the application in your Azure AD B2C tenant.

This value corresponds to `Identifier` (`EntityId`).

For this tutorial which using the SAML test application, the application lookup uses the `IdentifierUri` of `https://cpim3.ccsctp.net/samlAPPUITest`.

When an authentication is made with `AssertionConsumerServiceIndex`, only values from `metadataUrl` are considered.

> [!NOTE]
> If there are properties specified in both the SAML metadata URL and in the application object (the app registration's manifest), they are merged. The properties specified in the metadata URL are processed first and take precedence.

## 5. Update your application code

The last step is to enable Azure AD B2C as a SAML IdP in your SAML relying party application. Each application is different and the steps to do so vary. Consult your app's documentation for details.

Some or all the following are typically required:

* **Metadata**: `https://tenant-name.b2clogin.com/tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/policy-name/Samlp/metadata`
* **Issuer**: `https://tenant-name.b2clogin.com/tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/policy-name`
* **Login URL/SAML endpoint/SAML URL**: Check the value in the metadata file
* **Certificate**: This is *B2C_1A_YourAppNameSamlCert*, but without the private key. To get the public key of the certificate:

    1. Go to the metadata URL specified above.
    1. Copy the value in the `<X509Certificate>` element.
    1. Paste it into a text file.
    1. Save the text file as a *.cer* file.

### 5.1 Test with the SAML Test App (optional)

To complete this tutorial using our [SAML Test Application][samltest]:

* Update the tenant name
* Update policy name, for example *B2C_1A_signup_signin_SAML*
* Specify this issuer URI: `https://cpim3.ccsctp.net/samlAPPUITest`

Select **LOGIN** and you should be presented with an end user sign-in screen. Upon sign-in, a SAML assertion is issued back to the sample application.

## Sample policy

We provide a complete sample policy that you can use for testing with the SAML Test App.

1. Download the [SAML-SP-initiated login sample policy](https://github.com/azure-ad-b2c/saml-sp/tree/master/policy/SAML-SP-Initiated)
1. Update `TenantId` to match your tenant name, for example *contoso.b2clogin.com*
1. Keep the policy name of *B2C_1A_SAML2_signup_signin*

## Supported and unsupported SAML modalities

The following SAML relying party (RP) scenarios are supported via your own metadata endpoint:

* Multiple logout URLs or POST binding for logout URL in application/service principal object.
* Specify signing key to verify RP requests in application/service principal object.
* Specify token encryption key in application/service principal object.

Identity provider-initiated logins are not currently supported in the preview release.

## Next steps

The code for the SAML Test Application is here: TBD
