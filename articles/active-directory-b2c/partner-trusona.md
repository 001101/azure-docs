8. Provide a **Name** of your choice and use the domain information previously provided (for example, Contoso) in the **Client Redirect Host field**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Active Directory’s initial domain name is used as the Client Redirect host.

9. Follow the instructions mentioned in the [Trusona integration guide](https://docs.trusona.com/integrations/aad-b2c-integration/). Use the initial domain name (for example, Contoso) referred in the previous section when prompted.  

## Integrating Trusona with Azure AD B2C

### Creating an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a B2C tenant set-up, skip these steps.  

1. Select **Dashboard** from the sidebar.

2. In the search bar, enter **Azure Active Directory B2C**.  

3. Select **Create a new Azure AD B2C Tenant** from the dropdown.  

4. Enter **Organization name** and **Initial Domain Name**.

5. Select the **Create** button.

> [!NOTE]
> It may take a few minutes for the tenant to be created.

### Adding a new Identity provider

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** > **Azure AD B2C** > **Identity providers**

2. Select **Identity providers**

3. Select **Add**

### Configuring an Identity provider  

1. Select **Identity provider type** > **OpenID Connect (Preview)**

2. Fill-out the form below to set up the identity provider  

| Property | Value  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Metadata URL | `https://gateway.trusona.net/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration`|
| Client ID | Will be emailed to you from Trusona |
| Scope | OpenID profile email |
| Response type | Id_token |
| Response mode  | Form_post |

3. Select **Ok**.  

4. Select **Map this identity provider’s claims**.  

5. Fill-out the form below to map the identity provider  

| Property | Value  |
| :--- | :--- |
| UserID | Sub  |
| Display name | nickname |
| Given name | given_name |
| Surname | Family_name |
| Response mode | email |

6. Select **Ok** to complete the setup for your new OIDC Identity Provider.

### Creating a user flow policy

1. You should now see Trusona as a **new OpenID Connect Identity Provider** listed within your B2C Identity Providers.

2. Select **User flows (policies)** from the left navigation panel.

3. Select **Add** > **New user flow** > **Sign up and sign in**

### Configuring the Policy

1. Name your policy

2. Select your newly created **Trusona Identity Provider**.

3. As Trusona is inherently multi-factor, it's best to leave multi-factor authentication disabled.

4. Select **Create**.

5. Under **User Attributes and Claims**, choose **Show more**. In the form, select at least one attribute that you specified during the setup of your Identity Provider in earlier section.

6. Select **OK**.  

### Testing the Policy

1. Select your newly created policy

2. Select **Run user flow**

3. In the form, enter the Replying URL

4. Then select **Run user flow** button and you should be redirected to the Trusona OIDC gateway. On the Trusona gateway, scan the displayed Secure QR code with the Trusona app or with a custom app using the Trusona mobile SDK.

5. After scanning the Secure QR code, you should be redirected to the Reply URL you defined in step 3.
