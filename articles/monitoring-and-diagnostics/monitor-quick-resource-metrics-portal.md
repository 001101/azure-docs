# How do I browse metrics for my resources in Azure Portal

Metrics for many resources can be visualized through the Azure portal. This method provides a browser-based user interface to discover and plot metrics for Azure resources. This Quickstart steps through creating a Logic App, creating a job, and visualizing the metrics for the logic app.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Create a Logic App

1. Click the **New** button found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

2. Search for and select **Logic App**. Click the **Create** button.

3. Enter the logic app information and check the **Pin to Dashboard** option. When complete, click **Create**.

4. The logic app should be pinned to your dashboard. Navigate to the logic app by clicking on it.

5. In the Logic App blade, select the **Logic App Designer**

6. In the designer select the **Recurrence** trigger.

7. Set an **Interval** of 20 and a **Frequency** of second to ensure your logic app is triggered every 20 seconds

8. Click the **New Step** button, select **Add an action**, choose the **HTTP** option, and select **HTTP-HTTP**

10. Set the **Method** as post and the **Uri** to a web address of your choice

## View metrics for your logic app

1. Click the **Monitor** option in the left-hand navigation pane

2. Select the **Metrics** tab, fill in the **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, **Resource Type** and **Resource** information for your logic app

3. From the list of metrics, choose **Runs Started**

4. Modify the **Time range** of the chart to display data for the past hour

5. You should now see a chart plotting the total number of runs your logic app has started over the past hour
