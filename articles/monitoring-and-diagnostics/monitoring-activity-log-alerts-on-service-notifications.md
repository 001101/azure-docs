# Create activity log alerts on service notifications
## Overview
This article shows you how to set up activity log alerts for service health notifications by using the Azure portal.  

You can receive an alert when Azure sends service health notifications to your Azure subscription. You can configure the alert based on:

- The class of service health notification (incident, maintenance, information, etc.).
- The service(s) affected.
- The region(s) affected.
- The status of the notification (active vs. resolved).
- The level of the notifications (informational, warning, error).

You also can configure who the alert should be sent to:

- Select an existing action group.
- Create a new action group (that can be used for future alerts).

To learn more about action groups, see [Create and manage action groups](monitoring-action-groups.md).

For information on how to configure service health notification alerts by using Azure Resource Manager templates, see [Resource Manager templates](monitoring-create-activity-log-alerts-with-resource-manager-template.md).

## Create an alert on a service health notification for a new action group with the Azure portal
1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Monitor**.

2. In the **Activity log** section, select **Alerts**.

    ![The "Alerts" tab](./media/monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications/alerts-blades.png)

3. Select **Add activity log alert**, and fill in the fields.

    ![The "Add activity log alert" command](./media/monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications/add-activity-log-alert.png)

4. Enter a name in the **Activity log alert name** box, and provide a **Description**.

    ![The "Add activity log alert" dialog box](./media/monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications/activity-log-alert-service-notification-new-action-group.png)

5. The **Subscription** box autofills with your current subscription. This subscription is used to save the activity log alert. The alert resource is deployed to this subscription and monitors it.

6. Select the **Resource group** this alert is associated with.

7. In the **Event category** box, select **Service Health**. Select the **Service**, **Region**, **Type**, **Status**, and **Level** of service health notifications that you want to receive.

8. Under **Alert via**, select the **New** action group button. Enter a name in the **Action group name** box, and enter a name in the **Short name** box. The short name is referenced in the notifications that are sent when this alert fires.

9. Define a list of receivers by providing the receiver's:

    a. **Name**: Enter the receiverâ€™s name, alias, or identifier.

    b. **Action Type**: Select SMS, email, or webhook.

    c. **Details**: Based on the action type chosen, enter a phone number, email address, or webhook URI.

10.	Select **OK** to create the alert.

Within a few minutes, the alert is active and triggers.

For information on the webhook schema for activity log alerts, see [Webhooks for Azure activity log alerts](monitoring-activity-log-alerts-webhook.md).

>[!NOTE]
>The action group defined in these steps is reusable as an existing action group, for all future alert definitions.

## Create an alert on a service health notification by using an existing action group with the Azure portal

    ![The "Add activity log alert" dialog box](./media/monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications/activity-log-alert-service-notification-existing-action-group.png)
5. The **Subscription** box autofills with your current subscription. This subscription is used to save the activity log alert. The alert resource is deployed to this subscription and monitors it.

6. Select the **Resource group** this alert is associated with.

7. In the **Event category** box, select **Service Health**. Select the **Service**, **Region**, **Type**, **Status**, and **Level** of service health notifications you want to receive.

8. Under **Alert via**, select the **Existing** action group button. Select the appropriate action group.

9. Select **OK** to create the alert.

Within a few minutes, the alert is active and triggers as previously described.

## Manage your alerts

After you create an alert, it's visible in the **Alerts** section of the **Monitor** service. Select the alert you want to manage to:

* Edit it.
* Delete it.
* Disable or enable it, if you want to temporarily stop or resume receiving notifications for the alert.
