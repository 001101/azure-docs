# Azure Alerts user interface (Public Preview))

## Overview 
 
> [!NOTE] 
> This article describes the new alert experience in Azure Monitor. Classic alerts are described in [classic alerts Overview](monitoring-overview-alerts.md). 
 
A new alerts experience was released for Azure Monitor on June 1, 2018. This experience builds on the benefits of the [unified alerts experience](monitoring-overview-unified-alerts.md) released March 2018 and provides the ability to manage and aggregate individual alerts in addition to modifying alert state.

## Features in the new alert experience

The new experience provides the following features that aren't available in the classic experience:

- View and manage individual alerts across multiple subscriptions.
- Aggregate all alerts into single view organized by alert severity. 
- Change the state of alerts to reflect where it current is in the resolution process. 
- Organize alerts by smart groups which are automatically generated with machine learning algorithms.


## Accessing the new alert experience
Access the new alert experience by clicking on the banner at the top of the Alerts page. You can switch back and forth between the new and old experience by clicking on the banner.

## Alert States 
The state of an alert specifies where it is in the resolution process.  When an alert is created, it has a status of *New*. You can change the status when you've acknowledged an alert and when you've closed it.  The following alert states are supported.

| State | Description |
|:---|:---|
| New | The issue has just been detected and not yet reviewed. |
| Acknowledged | An administrator has reviewed the alert and started working on it. |
| Closed | The issue has been resolved. |

Note that once an alert has been closed, you can reopen it my changing it to another state.


### Changing the state of an alert or smart group
You can change the state of an alert by clicking on **Change alert state** in the detail view for the alert or **Change smart group state** in the detail view for the smart group. You can change the state of multiple items at one time by selecting them in a list view and clicking **Change State** at the top of the page. In both cases, select a new state from the dropdown and optionally provide a comment. If you're changing a single item, then you also have an option to apply the same changes to all the alerts in the smart group.

It displays the total alerts for each severity with columns identifying the total number of alerts in each state for each severity. Click any of the severities to open the **All Alerts** view filtered by that severity.
