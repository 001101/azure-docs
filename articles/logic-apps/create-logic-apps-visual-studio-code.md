# Create and edit automated logic app workflows - Visual Studio Code

With [Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) 
and Visual Studio Code, you can create and edit logic apps that help 
you automate tasks, workflows, and processes for integrating apps, 
data, systems, and services across organizations and enterprises. 
This article shows how you can build and edit logic app workflow 
definitions by working in a code-based experience. You can also 
view and edit existing logic apps already deployed to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/guides/developer/azure-developer-guide" target="_blank">Azure</a> 
in the cloud. 

Although you can perform these same tasks in the 
<a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> 
and in Visual Studio, you can get started faster in Visual Studio 
Code when you want to work directly in code. 

For this article, you can create the same logic app as in the 
[quickstart for creating a logic app in the Azure portal](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md), 
which focuses more on the basic concepts. In Visual Studio Code, 
the logic app looks like this example:

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these items:

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Azure account</a>.

* Basic knowledge about logic app 
[workflow definitions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-definition-language.md) 
and their structure, which uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

* Download and install these tools, if you don't have them already: 

  * <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code version 1.25.1 or later</a>, which is free. 

  * <a href="" target="_blank">Visual Code extension for Azure Logic Apps</a> 
  
    To learn how to download and install extensions 
    directly inside Visual Studio Code, see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery" target="_blank">Extension Marketplace</a>. 
    Make sure you reload Visual Studio Code after installing. 
    To check that the extension installed correctly, 
    the Azure icon appears in your Visual Studio Code toolbar.

* Access to the web for signing in to Azure and your Azure subscription

## Sign in to Azure

1. Open Visual Studio Code. On the Visual Studio Code toolbar, 
select the Azure icon. 

   ![Select Azure icon](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/open-extension.png)

1. In the Azure window, under **Logic Apps**, 
select **Sign in to Azure**. 

   ![Select "Sign in to Azure"](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/sign-in-azure.png)

   You're now prompted to sign in by using 
   the provided authentication code. 

1. Copy the authentication code, and then choose **Copy & Open**, 
which opens a new browser window.

   ![Sign-in prompt](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/sign-in-prompt.png)

1. Enter your authentication code. When prompted, choose **Continue**.

   ![Enter code](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/authentication-code.png)

1. Select your Azure account. After you've signed in, 
you can close your browser, and return to Visual Studio Code.

   In the Azure window, the Logic Apps pane and 
   Integration Accounts pane now shows the Azure 
   subscriptions in your account. 

   ![Select subscription](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/select-azure-subscription.png)

   If you don't see the subscriptions you expect, 
   next to **Logic Apps** label, choose **Select Subscriptions** 
   (filter icon). Find and select the subscriptions you want.

1. To view any existing logic apps or integration accounts in 
your Azure subscription, expand your subscription.

   ![View logic apps and integration accounts](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/existing-logic-apps.png)

## Create logic app

1. If you haven't signed in to your Azure subscription 
from inside Visual Studio Code, [sign in now](#sign-in-azure). 

1. From your subscription's context menu, select **Create**.

   ![Select "Create"](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/create-logic-app.png)

1. From the list that shows Azure resource groups in your subscription, 
select an existing resource group or **Create a new resource group**. 

   This example creates a new resource group:

   ![Create new resource group](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/select-or-create-azure-resource-group.png)

1. Provide a name for your Azure resource group, 
and then press ENTER.

   ![Name your resource group](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/enter-name-resource-group.png)

1. Select the location for where to save your logic app's metdata.

1. In the empty file, start creating your logic app's workflow definition. 
For reference, see the [Workflow Definition Language schema for logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-definition-language.md).

   For example, here's a sample logic definition. Usually, 
   JSON elements appear alphabetically within each section, 
   but this sample roughly shows these elements in the order 
   that the workflow steps appear on the designer.

   ```json
   {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {
         "$connections": {
            "defaultValue": {},
            "type": "Object"
         }
      },
      "triggers": {
         "When_a_feed_item_is_published": {
            "recurrence": {
               "frequency": "Minute",
               "interval": 1
            },
            "splitOn": "@triggerBody()?['value']",
            "type": "ApiConnection",
            "inputs": {
               "host": {
                  "connection": {
                     "name": "@parameters('$connections')['rss']['connectionId']"
                  }
               },
               "method": "get",
               "path": "/OnNewFeed",
               "queries": {
                  "feedUrl": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews"
               }
            }
         }
      },
      "actions": {
         "Send_an_email": {
            "runAfter": {},
            "type": "ApiConnection",
            "inputs": {
               "body": {
                  "Body": "Title: @{triggerBody()?['title']}\n\nDate published: @{triggerBody()?['publishDate']}\n\nLink: @{triggerBody()?['primaryLink']}",
                  "Subject": "New RSS item: @{triggerBody()?['title']}",
                  "To": "Sophie.Owen@contoso.com"
               },
               "host": {
                  "connection": {
                     "name": "@parameters('$connections')['outlook']['connectionId']"
                  }
               },
               "method": "post",
               "path": "/Mail"
            }
         }
      },
      "outputs": {}
   }   
   ```

1. When you're done, save your file as a **JSON** (.json) file. 

   Visual Studio Code prompts you to confirm uploading your 
   logic app definition to your Azure subscription in Azure. 

1. When Visual Studio Code prompts you, choose **Upload**.

## Edit logic app

To work on an existing logic app that's already deployed in Azure, 
you can open the workflow definition file for that app in Visual Studio Code.

1. Open Visual Studio Code, and [sign in to Azure](#sign-in). 

1. In the Azure window, under **Logic Apps**, 
expand your Azure subscription, and select the logic app you want. 

1. Next to your logic app's name, choose the edit icon.

   Visual Studio Code opens the .logicapp.json file 
   for your logic app's workflow definition.

   ![Opened logic app workflow definition](./media/create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code/edit-logic-app-workflow-definition-file.png)

1. Make your changes in your logic app's definition.

1. When you're done, save your changes.

1. When Visual Studio Code prompts you to update your 
logic app definition in your Azure subscription, 
choose **Upload**.
