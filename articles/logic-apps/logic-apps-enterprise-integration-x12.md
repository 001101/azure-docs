# Exchange X12 messages for B2B enterprise integration in Azure Logic Apps with Enterprise Integration Pack

To work with X12 messages in Azure Logic Apps, you can use the X12 connector, which provides triggers and actions for managing X12 communication. For information about EDIFACT messages instead, see [Exchange EDIFACT messsages](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-edifact.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* The logic app from where you want to use the X12 connector and a trigger that starts your logic app's workflow. The X12 connector provides only actions, not triggers. If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) and [Quickstart: Create your first logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

* An [integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) that's associated with your Azure subscription and linked to the logic app where you plan to use the X12 connector. Both your logic app and integration account must exist in the same location or Azure region.

* At least two [trading partners](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) that you've already defined in your integration account by using the X12 identity qualifier.

* A [schema](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) to use for XML validation that you've already added to your integration account. If you're working with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) schemas, see [Settings for HIPAA schemas](#hipaa-schemas).

* Before you can use the X12 connector, you must create an X12 [agreement](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements.md) between your trading partners and store that agreement in your integration account.

* If you use [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md) for certificate management, check that your vault keys permit the **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** operations. Otherwise, the encoding and decoding actions fail.

  In the Azure portal, go to the key in your key vault, review your key's **Permitted operations**, and confirm that the **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** operations are selected, for example:
