# Add and run custom code snippets in Azure Logic Apps with Azure Functions

When you want to create and run only enough code 
that addresses a specific problem in your logic apps, 
you can create your own functions by using 
[Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md). 
This service provides the capability for creating and running 
custom code snippets written with Node.js or C# in your logic 
apps without worrying about creating an entire app or the 
infrastructure for running your code. Azure Functions provides 
serverless computing in the cloud and is useful for 
performing tasks such as these examples:

* Extend your logic app's behavior with functions supported by Node.js or C#.
* Perform calculations in your logic app workflow.
* Apply advanced formatting or compute fields in your logic apps.

You can also [call logic apps from inside an Azure function](#call-logic-app).

If you don't have an Azure subscription yet, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Azure account</a>. 

## Prerequisites

To follow this article, here are the items you need:

* The logic app where you want to add the function

  If you're new to logic apps, review 
  [What is Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) 
  and [Quickstart: Create your first logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

* A [trigger](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts) 
as the first step in your logic app 

  Before you can add actions for running functions, 
  your logic app must start with a trigger.

* An Azure function app, which is a container for Azure functions, 
and your Azure function. Your function app must belong to the same 
Azure subscription as your logic app. 

  If you don't have a function app, you must 
  [create your function app first](../azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function.md). 
  You can then create your function either 
  [separately outside your logic app](#create-function-external), 
  or [from inside your logic app](#create-function-designer) 
  in the Logic App Designer. 

<a name="create-function-external"></a>

## Create functions outside logic apps

In the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a>, 
create your Azure function app, and then create your Azure function. 
If you're new to Azure Functions, see 
[Create your first function in the Azure portal](../azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function.md), 
but note these requirements for creating Azure functions 
that you can add and call from logic apps.

* Make sure you use one of these function templates, 
which can accept content that has `application/json` 
type from your logic app:

  * **Generic webhook - JavaScript** 
  * **Generic webhook - C#**

  These templates also help the Logic App Designer find 
  and show the custom functions that you create with these 
  templates when you add those functions to your logic apps.

  ![Generic webhook - JavaScript or C#](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/generic-webhook.png)

* After you create your function, check that the **Mode** 
and **Webhook type** properties are set correctly.

  1. In the **Function Apps** list, expand your function, 
  and select **Integrate**. 

  2. Check that your template's **Mode** property 
  is set to **Webhook** and that the **Webhook type** 
  property is set to **Generic JSON**. 

     ![Your function's "Integrate" properties](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/function-integrate-properties.png)

  Webhook functions can accept HTTP requests as input payloads and pass 
  the requests' content to other functions through a `data` variable. 
  To access the input properties, you can use dot (.) notation: 

  `data.<some-function>`

  For example, this basic JavaScript function converts a 
  DateTime value from the request body to a DateString 
  value by calling the ToDateString() function:
 
  ```javascript
  function convertToDateString(request, response){
     var data = request.body;
     response = {
        body: data.date.ToDateString();
     }
  }
  ```

After you create your Azure function, 
follow the steps for how to [add functions to logic apps](#add-function-logic-app).

## Create functions inside logic apps

Before you can create an Azure function starting 
from inside your logic app in the Logic App Designer, 
you must first have an Azure function app, 
which is a container for your functions. 
If you don't have a function app, 
create that function app first. See 
[Create your first function in the Azure portal](../azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function.md). 

1. In the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a>, 
open your logic app in the Logic App Designer. 

2. Under the step where you want to create and add the function, 
choose **New step** > **Add an action**. 

3. In the search box, enter "azure functions" as your filter.
From the actions list, select this action: 
**Azure Functions - Choose an Azure function** 

   ![Find "Azure functions"](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/find-azure-functions-action.png)

4. From the function apps list, select your function app. 
After the functions list opens, select this action: 
**Azure Functions - Create New Function**

   ![Select your function app](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/select-function-app-create-function.png)

5. Define your function:

   1. In the **Function name** box, 
   provide a name for your function. 

   2. In the **Code** box, enter your function's code, 
   including the response and payload you want returned 
   to your logic app after your function finishes running. 
   
   3. When you're done, choose **Create**. 

      ![Define your function](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/function-definition.png)

6. In the **Request Body** box, specify the context object 
that you'll pass as the input payload to your function. 
When you click inside the **Request Body** box, 
the dynamic content list opens so you can select data 
that's available from previous steps. 

   The context object describes the message and content 
   that your logic app sends to your function and must be 
   formatted as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object. 
   Based on this content, the Logic App Designer generates 
   a function template that you can create inline. 
   Also, Logic Apps creates variables based on the context 
   object you pass to the function.

   Here is a sample that passes in the body content 
   from the previous email trigger as the input payload:

   !["Request Body" example - context object payload](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/function-request-body-example.png)

   In this example, the context object isn't cast as a string, 
   so the content gets directly added to the JSON payload. 
   If the object isn't a JSON token, that is, 
   a string, a JSON object, or a JSON array, you get an error. 
   To cast the object as a string, add double-quotation marks, 
   for example:

   ![Cast object as string](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/function-request-body-string-cast-example.png)

7. To specify other details such as the method to use, 
request headers, or query parameters, choose **Show advanced options**.

## Add existing functions to logic apps

To call existing Azure functions from your logic apps, 
you can add Azure functions like any other action 
in the Logic App Designer.

1. In the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a>, 
open your logic app in the Logic App Designer. 

2. Under the step where you want to add the function, 
choose **New step** > **Add an action**. 

3. In the search box, enter "azure functions" as your filter.
From the actions list, select this action: 
**Azure Functions - Choose an Azure function** 

   ![Find "Azure functions"](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/find-azure-functions-action.png)

4. From the function apps list, select your function app. 
After the functions list appears, select your function: 

   ![Select your function app and Azure function](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/select-function-app-existing-function.png)

5. In the **Request Body** box, specify the context object 
that you'll pass as the input payload to your function. 
When you click inside the **Request Body** box, 
the dynamic content list opens so you can select data 
that's available from previous steps. 

   The context object describes the message and content 
   that your logic app sends to your function and must be 
   formatted as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object. 
   Based on this content, the Logic App Designer generates 
   a function template that you can create inline. 
   Also, Logic Apps creates variables based on the context 
   object you pass to the function.

   Here is a sample that passes in the body content 
   from the previous email trigger as the input payload:

   !["Request Body" example - context object payload](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/function-request-body-example.png)

   In this example, the context object isn't cast as a string, 
   so the content gets directly added to the JSON payload. 
   If the object isn't a JSON token, that is, 
   a string, a JSON object, or a JSON array, you get an error. 
   To cast the object as a string, add double-quotation marks, 
   for example:

   ![Cast object as string](./media/logic-apps-azure-functions/function-request-body-string-cast-example.png)

7. To specify other details such as the method to use, 
request headers, or query parameters, choose **Show advanced options**.

## Call logic apps from functions

To trigger a logic app from inside an Azure function, 
that logic app must have a callable endpoint, 
or more specifically, a **Request** trigger. 
Then, from inside your function, send an HTTP POST 
request to the URL for that **Request** trigger and 
include the payload you want that logic app to process. 
For more information, see [Call, trigger, or nest logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint.md).
