# Migrate to the latest SAP connector in Azure Logic Apps

This topic applies to the previous SAP connector, which is scheduled for deprecation. 
Instead, please use or migrate to the [newer and more advanced SAP connector](./logic-apps-using-sap-connector.md), 
which consolidates both the Application Server and Message Server connectors 
and helps you avoid having to change the connection type. The newer connector 
continues to use the SAP .Net connector library (SAP NCo) and is fully compatible with 
the previous connector.
