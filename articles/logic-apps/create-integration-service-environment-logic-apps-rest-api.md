# Create an integration service environment (ISE) by using the Logic Apps REST API

This article shows how to create an [*integration service environment* (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md) through the Logic Apps REST API for scenarios where your logic apps and integration accounts need access to an [Azure virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). An ISE is an isolated environment that uses dedicated storage and other resources that are kept separate from the "global" multi-tenant Logic Apps service. This separation also reduces any impact that other Azure tenants might have on your apps' performance. An ISE also provides you with your own static IP addresses. These IP addresses are separate from the static IP addresses that are shared by the logic apps in the public, multi-tenant service.

To create an ISE by using the Azure portal instead, see [Connect to Azure virtual networks from Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* A tool that you can use to create your ISE by calling the Logic Apps REST API with an HTTPS PUT request. For example, you can use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/), or you can build a logic app that performs this task.

## Send the request

To create your ISE by calling the Logic Apps REST API, make this HTTPS PUT request:

`PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironments/{integrationServiceEnvironmentName}?api-version=2019-05-01`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Logic Apps REST API 2019-05-01 version requires that you make your own HTTP PUT request for ISE connectors.

## Request header

In the request header, include these properties:

* `Content-type`: Set this property value to `application/json`.

* `Authorization`: Set this property value to the bearer token for the customer who has access to the Azure subscription or resource group that you want to use.

### Request body syntax

Here is the request body syntax, which describes the properties to use when you create your ISE:

```json
{
   "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID/resourceGroups/{Azure-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironments/{ISE-name}",
   "name": "{ISE-name}",
   "type": "Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironments",
   "location": "{Azure-region}",
   "sku": {
      "name": "Premium",
      "capacity": 1
   },
   "properties": {
      "networkConfiguration": {
         "accessEndpoint": {
            // Your ISE can use the "External" or "Internal" endpoint. This example uses "External".
            "type": "External"
         },
         "subnets": [
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{Azure-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{virtual-network-name}/subnets/{subnet-1}",
            },
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{Azure-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{virtual-network-name}/subnets/{subnet-2}",
            },
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{Azure-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{virtual-network-name}/subnets/{subnet-3}",
            },
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{Azure-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{virtual-network-name}/subnets/{subnet-4}",
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

### Request body example

This example request body shows the sample values:

```json
{
   "id": "/subscriptions/********************/resourceGroups/Fabrikam-RG/providers/Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironments/Fabrikam-ISE",
   "name": "Fabrikam-ISE",
   "type": "Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironments",
   "location": "WestUS2",
   "sku": {
      "name": "Premium",
      "capacity": 1
   },
   "properties": {
      "networkConfiguration": {
         "accessEndpoint": {
            // Your ISE can use the "External" or "Internal" endpoint. This example uses "External".
            "type": "External"
         },
         "subnets": [
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/********************/resourceGroups/Fabrikam-RG/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/Fabrikam-VNET/subnets/subnet-1",
            },
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/********************/resourceGroups/Fabrikam-RG/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/Fabrikam-VNET/subnets/subnet-2",
            },
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/********************/resourceGroups/Fabrikam-RG/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/Fabrikam-VNET/subnets/subnet-3",
            },
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/********************/resourceGroups/Fabrikam-RG/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/Fabrikam-VNET/subnets/subnet-4",
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}
```
