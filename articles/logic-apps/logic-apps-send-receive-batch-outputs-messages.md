# Batch processing: Group, send, and receive messages or outputs in batches for logic apps

To reduce the number of messages exchanged between logic apps, 
you can group messages and outputs from actions into batches. 
With Azure Logic Apps, you can create logic apps that can receive 
items as a batch by using the Batch trigger and send items 
to a batch by using the **Batch** action.

This topic shows how to create logic apps that can 
perform these batching tasks:

* Receive items that are sent to a batch.
* Send output from an action to a batch.
* Partition batches.

## Requirements

* An Azure subscription.

* Basic knowledge about logic apps. 
See Create your first logic app if you are new to Logic Apps for how to get started.

* An email account from any provider supported by Azure Logic Apps.

## Create logic apps that receives data as a batch

Before you can send items to a batch, you must first create a "batch receiver" 
logic app by using the **Batch** trigger. So when you later create logic apps 
that can send items to batch, you can select this "batch receiver" logic app.

The batch receiver logic app specifies the batch name, 
release criteria, and other settings, so that the 
batch sender logic apps know where to send the batched messages. 
The batch receiver doesn't need to know anything about the batch senders.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), 
create a logic app named "BatchReceiver". 
Choose the blank logic app template.

2. In Logic Apps Designer, add the **Batch** trigger, 
which starts your logic app workflow. 
In the search box, enter "batch" as your filter. 
Select this trigger: **Batch – Batch messages**

   ![Add Batch trigger](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/add-batch-receiver-trigger.png)

3. Provide a name for the batch, 
and specify criteria for releasing the batch, for example:

   * For **Batch Name**, enter "TestBatch".
   * For **Message Count**, enter "5".

   ![Provide Batch trigger details](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/receive-batch-trigger-details.png)

4. Add another action that sends an email when the batch trigger fires. 
So, each time the batch has five items, the logic app sends an email.

   1. Under the batch trigger, choose **+ New Step** > **Add an action**.
   2. In the search box, enter "email" as your filter.
   3. Based on your email provider, select an email connector. 
   
      For example, if you have a work or school account, 
      select the Office 365 Outlook connector. 
      If you have a Gmail account, select the Gmail connector.

   4. Select this action for your connector: **{*email provider*} - Send an email**

      ![Select "Send an email" action for your email provider](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/add-send-email-action.png)

5. If you didn't already set up a connection for your email provider, 
provide your email credentials for authentication when prompted. 
Learn more about [authenticating your email credentials](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md).

6. Set the properties for the action you just added.

   1. For the **To** box, enter the recipient's email address. 
   For testing purposes, you can use your own email address.

   2. In the **Subject** box, select **Partition Name** when 
   the **Dynamic content** list appears.

      ![From the "Dynamic content" list, select "Partition Name"](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/send-email-action-details.png)

      In a later section, you can specify how to partition, or divide, 
      the target batch into logical sets where you can send messages. 
      Each set has a unique number that's generated by the sender logic app. 
      This capability lets you use a single batch with multiple subsets and 
      define each subset by the name that you provide.

   3. For the **Body** box, select **Message Id**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Because the input for the send email action is an array, 
      > the designer automatically adds a **For each** loop 
      > around the **Send an email** action. 
      > This loop performs the inner action on each item in the batch. 
      > With the batch trigger set to five items, you get five emails 
      > each time the trigger fires.

      ![For "Body", select "Message Id"](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/send-email-action-details-for-each.png)

8.  Now that you created a logic app that can receive messages as a batch, 
save your logic app.

    ![Save your logic app](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/save-batch-receiver-logic-app.png)

## Create logic apps that send data to a batch

Now create one or more logic apps that can send data to the batch. 
The sender logic apps need to know where to send batches, 
but the batch receiver doesn't need to know anything about the senders.

1. Create another logic app with this name: "BatchSender"

   1. In the search box, enter "recurrence" as your filter. 
   Select this trigger: **Schedule - Recurrence**

      ![Add the "Schedule-Recurrence" trigger](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/add-schedule-trigger-batch-receiver.png)

   2. Set the frequency and interval to run the sender logic app every minute.

      ![Set frequency and interval for recurrence trigger](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/recurrence-trigger-batch-receiver-details.png)

2. Add a new step for sending messages to a batch.

   1. Under the recurrence trigger, choose **+ New Step** > **Add an action**.
   2. In the search box, enter "batch" as your filter.
   3. Select this action: 
   **Send messages to batch – Choose a Logic Apps workflow with batch trigger**

      ![Select "Send messages to batch"](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/send-messages-batch-action.png)

   4. Now select your "BatchReceiver" logic app that you previously created, 
   which now appears as an action.

      ![Select "batch receiver" logic app](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/send-batch-select-batch-receiver.png)

      > [!NOTE]
      > The list also shows any other logic apps that have batch triggers.

   5. Set the batch properties.

      1. For **Batch Name**, enter "TestBatch".
      2. In the **Message Content** box, 
      when the dynamic content list appears, choose **Expression**.
      Enter the expression **utcnow()**, and choose **OK**. 

         This expression sets the current date and time for the 
         message content that you send to the batch.

         ![In "Message Content", choose "Expression". Enter "utcnow()".](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/send-batch-receiver-details.png)

   6. Now set up a partition for the batch. Choose **Show advanced options**.

      1. In the **Partition Name** box, 
      when the dynamic content list appears, choose **Expression**.
      2. Enter this expression: **rand(1,6)**

         > ![NOTE] 
         > This **rand** function expression generates a number between one and five. 
         > So you are dividing this batch into five numbered partitions, 
         > which this expression dynamically sets.

         ![Set up partition for your destination batch](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/send-batch-receiver-partition-advanced-options.png)

3. Save your logic app. Your sender logic app should look like this example:

   ![Save your sender logic app](./media/logic-apps-send-receive-batch-outputs-messages/send-batch-receiver-details-finished.png)

## Test your logic app batching solution

To test your batching solution, 
leave your logic apps running for a few minutes. 
You should start getting groups of five emails, all with the same partition key.

Your BatchSender logic app runs every minute, 
generates a random number between one and five, 
and uses this generated number as the partition key 
for the target batch where messages are sent. 
Each time the batch has five items with the same partition key, 
your BatchReceiver logic app fires and sends mail for each message.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you're done testing, make sure that you disable the 
> BatchSender logic app to stop sending messages 
> to the batch and overloading your inbox.
