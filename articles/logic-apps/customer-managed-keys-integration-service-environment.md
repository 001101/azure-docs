# Set up customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest for integration service environments (ISEs) in Azure Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps relies on Azure Storage to store data at rest and automatically [encrypt that data](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md) by using Azure Storage Service Encryption (Azure SSE). This encryption protects your data and helps you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. By default, Azure Storage uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt your data.

When you create an [integration service environment (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md) for hosting your logic apps, and you want more control over the encryption keys used by Azure Storage, you can set up, use, and manage your own key by using [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/key-vault-overview.md). This capability is also known as "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK), and your key is called a "customer-managed key".

This topic shows how to set up and specify your own encryption key to use when you create your ISE. 

## Considerations

* You have to specify the customer-managed key to use when you create your ISE, not afterwards. You can't disable this key after you create your ISE. Currently, no support exists for rotating a customer-managed key for an ISE.

* To support customer-managed keys, your ISE requires an [external access endpoint](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-endpoint-access) and the [system-assigned managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md#how-does-the-managed-identities-for-azure-resources-work) to access resources in other Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants. The managed identity authenticates access to those resources for your ISE so that you don't have to sign in with your own credentials.

* Within 30 minutes after you create your ISE, go to your Azure key vault and grant the system-assigned managed identity access to that key vault. Otherwise, your ISE deployment fails.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* An Azure key vault, which has the **Soft Delete** and **Do Not Purge** properties enabled along with a key that you created with these property values:

  | Property | Value |
  |----------|-------|
  | **Key Type** | RSA |
  | **RSA Key Size** | 2048 |
  | **Enabled** | Yes |
  |||

  If you're new to Azure Key Vault, learn [how to create a key vault](../key-vault/quick-create-portal.md#create-a-vault) and [how to configure customer-managed keys](../storage/common/storage-encryption-keys-portal.md) by using the Azure portal. Or, use the Azure PowerShell commands, [New-AzKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/new-azkeyvault) and [Add-AzKeyVaultKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/Add-AzKeyVaultKey).

* A tool that can create your ISE by sending a PUT request, for example, Postman or even a logic app

## Create ISE that uses your key

When you create your ISE, enable support for these items:

* External access endpoint
* The customer-managed key in your key vault
* The system-assigned managed identity that your ISE uses to access that key in your key vault

Here's the syntax for the properties and values to use in the JSON definition for your ISE:

```json

   <other-ISE-definition-properties>,

      "name": "Premium",
      "capacity": 1
   },
   "properties": {
      "networkConfiguration": {
         "accessEndpoint": {
            "type": "External"
         },
         "subnets": [
            {

            },
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<Azureresource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<virtual-network-name>/subnets/<subnet-2>",
               "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets"

               "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets"
            },
            {
               "id": "/subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<Azure-resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<virtual-network-name>/subnets/<subnet-4>",
               "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets"
            }
         ]
      },
      "encryptionConfiguration": {
         "encryptionKeyReference": {
            "keyVault": {
               "name": "<key-vault-name>",
               "id": "subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<Azure-resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<key-vault-name>",
               "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults"
            },
            "keyName": "<customer-managed-key-name>",
            "keyVersion": "<key-version-number>"
         }
      }

   "type": "Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironments",
   "location": "<Azure-region>",
   "identity": {

## Give identity access to your key vault

Within *30 minutes* after you create your ISE, you must grant the ISE's system-assigned identity access to your key vault . Otherwise, creation and deployment for your ISE fails, and you get a permissions error. You can use either Azure PowerShell ([Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/set-azkeyvaultaccesspolicy) command) or follow these steps for the Azure portal:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Azure key vault. From your key vault's menu, select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. On the toolbar, select **Add** > **Add role assignment**. 

1. On the **Add role assignment** pane, select these values:

   * **Role**: Contributor
   * **Assign access to**: Azure AD user, group, or service principal
   * **Select**: The name for your ISE

1. When you're done, select **Save**.

For more information, see [Add or remove role assignments using Azure RBAC and the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
