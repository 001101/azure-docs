# Set up customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest for integration service environments (ISEs) in Azure Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps relies on Azure Storage to store data at rest and automatically [encrypt that data](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md) by using Azure Storage Service Encryption (Azure SSE). This encryption protects your data and helps you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. By default, Azure Storage uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt your data.

When you create an [integration service environment (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md) for hosting your logic apps, and you want more control over the encryption keys used by Azure Storage, you can set up, use, and manage your own key by using [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/key-vault-overview.md). This capability is also known as "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK), and your key is called a "customer-managed key".

This topic shows how to set up and specify your own encryption key to use when you create your ISE. 

## Considerations

* You can specify a customer-managed key *only when you create your ISE*, not afterwards. You also can't disable this key after your ISE is created. Currently, no support exists for rotating a customer-managed key for an ISE.

* To support customer-managed keys, create an ISE that has an [external access endpoint](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md#ise-endpoint-access) and uses the [system-assigned managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md#how-does-the-managed-identities-for-azure-resources-work) to access resources in other Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants. The managed identity authenticates access for your ISE so that you don't have to sign in with your own credentials.

* Currently, the only way to create an ISE that uses a customer-managed key and the system-assigned identity is by calling the Logic Apps REST API with an HTTPS PUT request. To perform this task, you can use a tool such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/), or you can create a logic app.

* Within *30 minutes* after you send the HTTPS PUT request that creates your ISE, open your Azure key vault in the Azure portal, and [add an access policy to your key vault for the system-assigned identity](#identity-access-to-key-vault). Otherwise, ISE creation fails and throws a permissions error.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* An Azure key vault, which has the **Soft Delete** and **Do Not Purge** properties enabled along with a key that you created with these property values:

  | Property | Value |
  |----------|-------|
  | **Key Type** | RSA |
  | **RSA Key Size** | 2048 |
  | **Enabled** | Yes |

  If you're new to Azure Key Vault, learn [how to create a key vault](../key-vault/quick-create-portal.md#create-a-vault) and [how to configure customer-managed keys](../storage/common/storage-encryption-keys-portal.md) by using the Azure portal. Or, use the Azure PowerShell commands, [New-AzKeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/new-azkeyvault) and [Add-AzKeyVaultKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/Add-AzKeyVaultKey).

* A tool that you can use to create your ISE by calling the Logic Apps REST API with an HTTPS PUT request. For example, you can use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/), or you can build a logic app that performs this task.

## Create ISE with key vault and managed identity support

To create your ISE by calling the Logic Apps REST API, make this HTTPS PUT request:

`PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Logic/integrationServiceEnvironments/{integrationServiceEnvironmentName}?api-version=2018-07-01-preview`

### Request header

In the request header, include the `Authorization` property and set the property value to the bearer token for the customer who has access to the Azure subscription or resource group that you want to use.

### Request body

In the request body, enable support for these additional items in your ISE:

* External access endpoint
* Your key vault and the customer-managed key that you want to use
* The system-assigned managed identity that your ISE uses to access your key vault

Here's the request body syntax for the properties and values that you need to create your ISE:

## Grant access to your key vault

Within *30 minutes* after you send the HTTP PUT request to create your ISE, you must grant access to your key vault for your ISE's system-assigned identity. Otherwise, creation for your ISE fails, and you get a permissions error. You can use either the Azure PowerShell [Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/set-azkeyvaultaccesspolicy) command, or you can follow these steps for the Azure portal:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Azure key vault.

1. On your key vault menu, select **Access policies** > **Add Access Policy**, for example:

   ![Add access policy for system-assigned managed identity](./media/customer-managed-keys-integration-service-environment/add-ise-access-policy-key-vault.png)

1. After the **Add access policy** pane opens, follow these steps:

   1. Select these options:

      | Setting | Values |
      |---------|--------|
      | **Configure from template (optional) list** | Key Management |
      | **Key permissions** | - **Key Management Operations**: Get, List, Backup, Restore <p><p>- **Cryptographic Operations**: Decrypt, Encrypt, Unwrap Key, Wrap Key, Verify, Sign |
      |||

      ![Select "Key Management" > "Key permissions"](./media/customer-managed-keys-integration-service-environment/select-key-permissions.png)

   1. For **Select principal**, select **None selected**. After the **Principal** pane opens, in the search box, find and select your ISE. When you're done, choose **Select** > **Add**.

      ![Select your ISE to use as the principal](./media/customer-managed-keys-integration-service-environment/select-service-principal-ise.png)

   1. When you're finished with the **Access policies** pane, select **Save**.
