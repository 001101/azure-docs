# Handle throttling problems ("Too many requests (429)") in Azure Logic Apps

When you use Azure Logic Apps, you might experience these kinds of throttling:

* [Logic app](#logic-app-throttling)
* [Connector](#connector-throttling)
* [Destination service or system](#destination-throttling)

## Logic app throttling

The Azure Logic Apps service has its own [throughput limits](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#throughput-limits). If your logic app exceeds these limits, throttling happens at the logic app's level, not the logic app's run level, Azure subscription level, or Azure resource group level.

To find throttling errors at this level, check your logic app's **Metrics** pane in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app in the Logic App Designer.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Monitoring**, select **Metrics**. 

To handle throttling at this level, you have these options:

* Enable high throughput mode

  Your logic app has a default limit on the number of actions that can run in a 5-minute rolling interval. To raise this limit to the maximum number of actions, turn on [high throughput mode](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#run-high-throughput-mode) on your logic app.

* Refactor actions into multiple logic apps

  Consider whether you can break down your logic app's actions into smaller logic apps so that each logic app runs a number of actions below the limit.

## Connector throttling

Each connector has its own throttling limits, which you can find on the connector's technical reference page. For example, the [Azure Service Bus connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/servicebus/) has a throttling limit that permits up to 6,000 calls per minute.

To find throttling errors at this level, check the connector's "retry" history. You might have trouble differentiating between connector throttling and [destination throttling](#destination-throttling). In this case, you might have to review the response details or perform some calculations to identify the source. 

For logic apps that run in the public, multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps service, versus an [integration service environment (ISE)](../logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md), throttling happens at the *connection* level, not connector level.

To handle throttling at this level, you have these options:

* Distribute the work

  Consider whether you can spread the workload across different connections, even if those connections communicate with same service or system, but still use the same credentials.

  For example, suppose your logic app gets a row from a SQL Server database, processes the data from that row, and then updates that row with the results. You can use separate connections so that one connection gets the row, while the other connection updates the row.

* Set up multiple connections per action

  You can create more than one connection for a single action and then choose the connection to actually use at run time.

## Destination service or system throttling

While a connector has its own throttling limits, the destination service or system that's called by the connector might also have throttling limits. For example, some APIs in Microsoft Exchange Server have stricter throttling limits than the Office 365 Outlook connector.

By default, a logic app's instances and any loops or branches inside those instances, run *in parallel*. This behavior means that multiple instances can call the same endpoint at the same time. Each instance don't know about the other's existence, so attempts to retry failed actions can create [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) where multiple calls try to run at same time, but to succeed, the destination service or system requires that those calls happen in a specific order.

For example, suppose you have an array that has 100 items. You use a "for each" loop to iterate through the array and set that loop's [concurrency](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#concurrency-looping-and-debatching-limits) to 20 iterations in parallel. Inside that loop, an action inserts an item from the array into a SQL Server database, which permits only 15 calls per second.

This table shows the timeline for what happens in the loop when the action's retry interval is 1 second:

| Point in time | Number of actions that run | Number of actions that fail | Number of retries waiting |
|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| T + 0 seconds | 20 inserts | 5 fail, due to SQL limit | 5 retries |
| T + 0.5 seconds | 15 inserts, due to previous 5 retries waiting | All 15 fail, due to previous SQL limit still in effect for 0.5 more seconds | 20 retries <br>(previous 5 + 15 new) |
| T + 1 second | 20 inserts | 5 fail plus previous 20 retries, due to SQL limit | 25 retries (previous 20 + 5 new)

To handle throttling at this level, you have these options:

* Queue up array items
