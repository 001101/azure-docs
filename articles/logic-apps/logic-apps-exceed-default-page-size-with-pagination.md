# Get bulk data, records, and items with pagination in Azure Logic Apps

When you get data, records, or items by using a connector action in Azure Logic Apps, 
your results might exceed the connector's default page size. For example, the default 
page size limit for the SQL Server connector's **Get rows** action is 2048. This limit 
might also vary based on other settings. In this scenario, the action returns only the 
first page of results. In other scenarios, you might be working with results so large 
that you want better control over the size and structure for your result sets.

Specific actions, such as the SQL Server **Get rows** action, support *pagination* so that 
the action can get the remaining results, but returns all those results in a single message 
when the action finishes. When you use pagination, you also specify a limit that sets the *minimum* number of results that the action returns. The action continues retrieving results until the action gets *at least* the specified minimum or the default limit, whichever number 
is smaller. If your final set of results exceeds your specified minimum, the action returns 
those results. For example, suppose you set the limit to at least 5000 items. If the final 
set returns 5100 items, you get that number of items.

This list shows just some connectors where you 
can turn on pagination for specific actions:

## Turn on pagination

To determine whether an action supports pagination in the Logic App Designer, 
check the action's settings for the **Pagination** setting. This example shows 
how to turn on pagination in the SQL Server's **Get rows** action.

1. In the action's upper-right corner, choose the 
ellipses (**...**) button, and select **Settings**.

   ![Open the action's settings](./media/logic-apps-exceed-default-page-size-with-pagination/sql-action-settings.png)

   If the action supports pagination, 
   the action shows the **Pagination** setting.

1. Change the **Pagination** setting from **Off** to **On**. 
In the **Limit** property, specify the *minimum number* of 
results that you want the action to return.

1. When you're ready, choose **Done**.

## Workflow definition - pagination

When you turn on pagination for an action that supports this capability, 
your logic app's workflow definition includes the `"paginationPolicy"` 
property along with the `"minimumItemCount"` property in that action's 
`"runtimeConfiguration"` property, for example:

```json
"actions": {
   "HTTP": {
      "inputs": {
         "method": "GET",
         "uri": "https://www.testuri.com"
      },
      "runAfter": {},
      "runtimeConfiguration": {
         "paginationPolicy": {
            "minimumItemCount": 1000
         }
      },
      "type": "Http"
   }
},
```
