# Get bulk data, records, and items by setting up pagination in Azure Logic Apps

When you get data, records, or items by using a connector action in Azure Logic Apps, 
your results might exceed the connector's default page size. In this scenario, 
the action returns only the first page of results. For example, the default page size 
for the SQL Server connector's **Get rows** action is 2048. This limit might also vary 
based on other settings. In another scenario, you might be working with resuls so large 
that you want better control over the size and structure for your result sets.

Some actions, such as the SQL Server **Get rows** action, support the pagination capability, 
which makes an action get the remaining results, but returns all those results in 
a single message when the action finishes. You can also specify a minimum number 
of results that the action returns. The action continues getting results until the 
action has at least the specified minimum or the default maximum number of results, 
whichever number is smaller. If the initial response or a subsequent response doesn't 
link to the next page of items, your logic app doesn't make the call for the next page of results.

This list shows just some of the connectors where you 
can turn on pagination for specific actions:

## Set up pagination

To determine whether an action supports pagination, 
check the action's settings for the **Pagination** setting.
This example shows how to turn on pagination in the SQL 
Server's **Get rows** action.

1. In the action's upper-right corner, choose the 
ellipses (**...***) button, and select **Settings**.

   ![On the action, open "Settings"](./media/logic-apps-exceed-default-page-size-with-pagination/sql-action-settings.png)

   If the action supports pagination, 
   the action displays the **Pagination** setting.

1. Change the **Pagination** setting from **Off** to **On**. 
In the **Limit** property, specify the minimum number of results 
that you want the action to return.

1. When you're ready, choose **Done**.
