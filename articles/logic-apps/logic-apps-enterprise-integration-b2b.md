# Receive and send B2B messages by using Azure Logic Apps and Enterprise Integration Pack

When you have an integration account that defines trading partners and agreements, you can create an automated business to business (B2B) workflow that exchanges messages between trading partners by using [Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-overview) with the [Enterprise Integration Pack](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview.md). Azure Logic Apps works with connectors that support AS2, X12, EDIFACT, and RosettaNet industry-standard protocols. You can also combine these connectors with other [connectors available in Logic Apps](../connectors/apis-list.md), for example, Salesforce and Office 365 Outlook.

This article shows how to create a logic app that receives an HTTP request by using a Request trigger, decodes the message content by using the AS2 and X12 actions, and then returns a response by using the Response action.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* A blank logic app so that you can create the B2B workflow by using the [Request](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md) trigger, which is followed by the [AS2 Decode](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-as2.md) action, [Decode X12 message](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12.md) action, and [Response](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md) action in this example. If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) and [Quickstart: Create your first logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

* An [integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) that's associated with your Azure subscription and linked to your logic app. Both your logic app and integration account must exist in the same location or Azure region.

* At least two [trading partners](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) that you've already defined in your integration account along with [AS2 and X12 agreements](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreement.md) for those partners.

## Add Request trigger

This example uses the Logic App Designer in the Azure portal, but you can follow similar steps for the Logic App Designer in Visual Studio.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your blank logic app in the Logic App Designer.

1. In the search box, enter `when a http request`, and select **When an HTTP request is received** to use as the trigger.

   ![Select Request trigger to start your logic app workflow](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/select-http-request-trigger.png)

1. In the **Request body JSON Schema** box, enter the JSON schema that describes the body content that you expect from the incoming request. For more information, see [Receive and respond to incoming HTTPS calls](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md).

   ![Provide JSON schema for expected request body input](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/receive-trigger-message-body-json-schema.png)

1. When you're done, on the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   This step generates the **HTTP POST URL** to use for sending the request that triggers the logic app. To copy this URL, select the copy icon next to the URL.

## Add B2B actions

Now add the B2B actions that you want to use. This example uses AS2 and X12 actions.

1. Under the trigger, select **New step**. To hide the trigger details, click on the trigger's title bar.

   ![Add another step to your logic app workflow](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/add-new-action-under-trigger.png)

1. Under **Choose an action**, in the search box, enter `as2 decode`, and select **AS2 Decode (v2)**.

   ![Find and select "AS2 Decode (v2)"](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/add-as2-decode-action.png)

1. For the **Body** property, enter the input that you want the AS2 action to decode, which is the `body` content that's received by the HTTP request trigger. You have these options:

   * To select from the available trigger outputs, click inside the **Body** box. After the dynamic content list appears, under **When a HTTP request is received**, select **Body**, for example:

     ![Select "Body" value from trigger](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/select-body-content-from-trigger.png)

   * To enter an expression that references the trigger's `body` output, click inside the **Body** box. After the dynamic content list appears, select **Expression**. In the expression editor, enter this expression, and select **OK**:

     `@triggerOutputs()['body']`

      The expression resolves to the **Body** token. You can also use just `triggerBody()`.

1. For the **Headers** property, enter any headers required for the AS2 action, which is the `headers` content that's received by the HTTP request trigger. You have these options:

   * To select from the available trigger outputs, click inside the **Headers** box. After the dynamic content list appears, under **When a HTTP request is received**, select **Headers**, for example:

     ![Select "Headers" value from trigger](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/select-headers-content-from-trigger.png)

   * To enter an expression that references the trigger's `headers` output, click inside the **Body** box. After the dynamic content list appears, select **Expression**. In the expression editor, enter this expression, and select **OK**:

   * In the **Headers** box, enter an expression that references the trigger's `headers` output, for example:

     `@triggerOutputs()['headers']`

      The expression resolves to the **Headers** token.

1. Now add the **Decode X12 message** action. Under the **AS2 Decode** action, select **New step**.

1. Under **Choose an action**, in the search box, enter `x12 decode`, and select **Decode X12 message**.

   ![Find and select "Decode X12 message" action](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/add-x12-decode-action.png)

1. Now specify the input for the X12 action. This example uses the output from the AS2 action, which is the message content but note that this content is in JSON object format and is base64 encoded. So, you have to convert this content to a string.

   1. If the X12 action prompts you for connection information, provide the name for the connection, select the integration account you want to use, and then select **Create**.

      ![Create X12 connection to integration account](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/create-x12-integration-account-connection.png)

   1. In the **X12 Flat file message to decode** box, enter this expression to convert the AS2 output:

      `@base64ToString(body('AS2_Decode')?['AS2Message']?['Content'])`

      The expression resolves to the **base64ToString(...)** token:

      ![Convert base64-encoded content to a string](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/x12-decode-message-content.png)

1. Save your logic app.

   Continue building your logic app, if you need additional steps to decode the message content and output that content in JSON object format.

## Add Response action

To notify the trading partner that the message was received, you can return a response that contains an AS2 Message Disposition Notification (MDN) by using the Response action.

1. Under the **Decode X12 message** action, select **New step**.

1. Under **Choose an action**, in the search box, enter `response`, and select **Response**.

   ![Find and select the "Response" action](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/select-http-response-action.png)

1. To access the AS2 MDN from the **Decode X12 message** action's output, in the **Response** action's **Body** property, enter this expression:

   `@base64ToString(body('AS2_Decode')?['OutgoingMdn']?['Content'])`

   The expression resolves to the **base64ToString(...)** token:

   ![Resolved expression to access AS MDN](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-b2b/response-action-resolved-expression.png)

1. Save your logic app.

You're now done setting up your B2B logic app. In a real world app, you might want to store the decoded X12 data in a line-of-business (LOB) app or data store. To connect your own LOB apps and use these APIs in your logic app, you can add further actions or write custom APIs.
