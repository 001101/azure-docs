# Secure access in Azure Logic Apps

Here are the areas where you can secure access to your logic apps:

* [HTTP request triggers](#secure-triggers)
* [Operations that view, manage, or edit logic apps](#secure-operations)
* [Run history inputs and outputs](#secure-run-history)
* [Action parameters and inputs](#secure-action-parameters)
* [Services that get requests](#secure-requests) from your logic app

<a name="secure-triggers"></a>

## Access to HTTP request triggers

When your logic app uses an HTTP request-based trigger, such as the [Request](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md) or [Webhook](../connectors/connectors-native-webhook.md) trigger, you can restrict access so that only authorized clients can start your logic app. All requests received by a logic app are encrypted and secured with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Here are the different ways that you can secure access to this trigger type:

* [Generate shared access signatures](#sas)
* [Restrict incoming IP addresses](#restrict-incoming-ip-addresses)
* [Add Azure Active Directory, OAuth, or other security](#add-authentication)

<a name="sas"></a>

### Generate shared access signatures

Every request endpoint on a logic app includes a [Shared Access Signature (SAS)](../storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1.md) in the endpoint's URL. Each URL contains an `sp`, `sv`, and `sig` query parameter:

| Query parameter | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `sp` | Specifies permissions for the permitted HTTP methods to use. |
| `sv` | Specifies the version to use for generating the signature. |
| `sig` | For authenticating access to the trigger |
|||

The signature is generated by using the SHA256 algorithm with a secret access key on all the URL paths and properties. The secret key is never exposed or published, and is kept encrypted and stored with the logic app. Your logic app authorizes only those triggers that contain a valid signature created with the secret key.

For more information about securing access with Shared Access Signature, see these sections in this topic:

* [Regenerate access keys](#access-keys)
* [Create expiring callback URLs](#expiring-urls)
* [Create URLs with primary or secondary key](#primary-secondary-key)

<a name="access-keys"></a>

#### Regenerate access keys

To regenerate a new secure access key at any time, use the Azure REST API or Azure portal. All previously generated URLs that use the old key are invalidated and no longer have authorization to trigger the logic app. The URLs that you retrieve after regeneration are signed with the new access key.

1. In the Azure portal, open the logic app that has the key you want to regenerate.

1. On the logic app's menu, under **Settings**, select **Access Keys**.

1. Select the key you want to regenerate and complete the process.

<a name="expiring-urls"></a>

#### Create callback URLs with expiration dates

If you share the endpoint URL for an HTTP request-based trigger with other parties, you can generate callback URLs that use specific keys and have expiration dates. That way, you can seamlessly roll keys or restrict access to triggering your logic app based on a specific timespan. To specify an expiration date for a URL, use the [Logic Apps REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/logic/workflowtriggers), for example:

``` http
POST /subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<Azure-resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/<workflow-name>/triggers/<trigger-name>/listCallbackUrl?api-version=2016-06-01
```

In the body, include the `NotAfter`property by using a JSON date string. This property returns a callback URL that's valid only until the `NotAfter` date and time.

<a name="primary-secondary-key"></a>

#### Create URLs with primary or secondary secret key

When you generate or list callback URLs for HTTP request-based triggers, you can specify the key to use for signing the URL. To generate a URL that's signed by a specific key, use the [Logic Apps REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/logic/workflowtriggers), for example:

``` http
POST /subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<Azure-resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/<workflow-name>/triggers/<trigger-name>/listCallbackUrl?api-version=2016-06-01
```

In the body, include the `KeyType` property as either `Primary` or `Secondary`. This property returns a URL that's signed by the specified secure key.

<a name="restrict-incoming-ip"></a>

### Restrict incoming IP addresses

Along with Shared Access Signature, you might want to limit the specific clients that can call your logic app.  
For example, if you manage your request endpoint by using Azure API Management, you can restrict your logic app to accept requests only from the IP address for the API Management instance.

#### Set IP ranges - Azure portal

To set up this restriction in the Azure portal, go to your logic app's settings.

1. In the Azure portal, open your logic app in the Logic App Designer.

1. On your logic app's menu, under **Settings**, select **Workflow settings**.

1. Under **Access control configuration** > **Allowed inbound IP addresses**, select **Specific IP ranges**.

1. Under **IP ranges for triggers**, specify the IP address ranges that the trigger accepts. A valid IP range uses these formats: *x.x.x.x/x* or *x.x.x.x-x.x.x.x*

If you want your logic app to fire only as a nested logic app, from the **Allowed inbound IP addresses** list, select **Only other Logic Apps**. This option writes an empty array to your logic app resource. That way, only only calls from the Logic Apps service (parent logic apps) can trigger the nested logic app.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of IP address, you can still run a logic app that has an HTTP request-based trigger 
> by using `/triggers/<trigger-name>/run` through the Azure REST API or through API Management. 
> However, > this scenario still requires authentication against the Azure REST API. 
> All events appear in the Azure Audit Log. Make sure you set access control policies accordingly.

#### Set IP ranges - logic app deployment template

If you're automating logic app deployments by using an [Azure Resource Manager deployment template](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-deploy-template.md), you can set the IP ranges in that template, for example:

``` json
{
   "properties": {
      "definition": {},
      "parameters": {},
      "accessControl": {
         "triggers": {
            "allowedCallerIpAddresses": [
               {
                  "addressRange": "192.168.12.0/23"
               },
               {
                  "addressRange": "2001:0db8::/64"
               }
            ]
         }
      }
   },
   "type": "Microsoft.Logic/workflows",
}
```

<a name="add-authentication"></a>

### Add Azure Active Directory, OAuth, or other security

To add more authorization protocols to your logic app, consider using [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/). This service gives you the capability to expose your logic app as an API and offers rich monitoring, security, policy, and documentation for any endpoint. API Management can expose a public or private endpoint for your logic app, which can then use Azure Active Directory, OAuth, certificate, or other security standards. When API Management receives a request, the service sends the request to your logic app, also making any necessary transformations or restrictions along the way. To let only API Management trigger your logic app, you can use your logic app's incoming IP range settings.

<a name="secure-operations"></a>

## Secure access to logic app operations

To permit only specific users or groups that can run operations, such as managing, editing, and viewing logic apps, you can restrict by using [Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md). You can assign customized or built-in roles to members in your Azure subscription, for example:

* [Logic App Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#logic-app-contributor): Lets you manage logic apps, but you can't change access to them.

* [Logic App Operator](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#logic-app-operator): Lets you read, enable, and disable logic apps, but you can't edit or update them.

To prevent others from changing or deleting your logic app, you can use [Azure Resource Lock](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources.md), which prevents others from changing or deleting production resources.

<a name="secure-run-history"></a>

## Secure access to run history

All data during a logic app's run is encrypted during transit and at rest. When your logic app finishes running, you can view the history for that run, including the steps that ran along with the status, duration, inputs, and outputs for each action. This rich detail provides insight into how your logic app ran and where you might start troubleshooting any problems that arise.

When you access your logic app's run history, Logic Apps authenticates your access and provides links to the inputs and outputs from the requests and responses in your logic app's run. However, for actions that handle any secrets or sensitive information, you want to prevent others from viewing and accessing that data. For example, if your logic app gets a secret from Azure Key Vault to use when authenticate an HTTP action, you want to hide that secret from view.

To control access to the inputs and outputs in your logic app's run history, you have these options:

* [Restrict access to specific IP address ranges](#restrict-ip).

  This option lets you secure access based on requests from a specific address range.

* [Hide inputs and outputs by using obfuscation](#obfuscation).

  This option lets you secure access based on the individual trigger or action. Here are some considerations when using obfuscation:

  * When you secure the outputs on an action, Logic Apps also blocks the action's input history for any action that explicitly references that output. Also, the [Logic Apps API for handling workflow history](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/logic/) doesn't return secured outputs.

  * If an action uses secured output as input, that input is treated as secure only if that action emits the same data as the input used. So, make sure that you also turn on secure outputs on that action.

  * When you secure the inputs or outputs on an action, you prevent that action from sending the secured data to Azure Log Analytics. You also can't add [tracked properties](logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps.md#azure-diagnostics-event-settings-and-details) that action for monitoring.

<a name="restrict-ip"></a>

### Restrict access by IP range

You can limit access to the inputs and outputs in your logic app's run history so that only requests from specific IP address ranges can view that data. For example, to block anyone from accessing inputs and outputs, you can specify an IP address range such as
`0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0` . Only a person with administrator permissions can remove this restriction, which provides the possibility for "just-in-time" access to your logic app's data.

You can limit access to IP ranges either by using the Azure portal or by using an Azure Resource Manager template that you use for logic app deployment.

### Restrict IP ranges in the Azure portal

1. In the Azure portal, open your logic app in the Logic App Designer.

1. On your logic app's menu, under **Settings**, select **Workflow settings**.

1. Under **Access control configuration** > **Allowed inbound IP addresses**, select **Specific IP ranges**.

1. Under **IP ranges for contents**, specify the IP address ranges that can access content from inputs and outputs. A valid IP range uses these formats: *x.x.x.x/x* or *x.x.x.x-x.x.x.x*

### Restrict IP ranges in logic app template

If you automate logic app deployment by using a [Azure Resource Manager template](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-deploy-template.md), you can specific the IP ranges in that template by using the `accessControl` object, for example:

``` json
{
   "properties": {
      "definition": {},
      "parameters": {},
      "accessControl": {
         "contents": {
            "allowedCallerIpAddresses": [
               {
                  "addressRange": "192.168.12.0/23"
               },
               {
                  "addressRange": "2001:0db8::/64"
               }
            ]
         }
      }
   },
   "type": "Microsoft.Logic/workflows",
}
```

<a name="obfuscate"></a>

### Secure access by obfuscation


1. If your logic app isn't already open in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app in the Logic App Designer.

   ![Open sample logic app](media/logic-apps-obfuscate-inputs-outputs/sample-logic-app.png)

1. On the trigger or action where you want to secure data, select the ellipses (**...**) button, and then select **Settings**.

   ![Open "Settings"](media/logic-apps-obfuscate-inputs-outputs/open-settings.png)

1. Turn on either **Secure inputs**, **Secure outputs**, or both. When you're finished, select **Done**.

   ![Turn on secure inputs or outputs](media/logic-apps-obfuscate-inputs-outputs/turn-on-secure-inputs-outputs.png)

   The action or trigger now shows a lock icon in the title bar.

   ![Lock icon on title bar](media/logic-apps-obfuscate-inputs-outputs/title-bar-lock-icon.png)

   Tokens that represent secured outputs from previous actions also show lock icons. For example, when you select such an output from the dynamic content list to use in an action, that token shows a lock icon.

   ![Select output](media/logic-apps-obfuscate-inputs-outputs/select-secured-token.png)

   When you view your logic app's run history, the secured inputs and outputs appear hidden.

<a name="secure-action-parameters"></a>

## Secure action parameters and inputs

When deploying across various environments, you might want 
to parameterize specific elements in your logic app's workflow 
definition. That way, you can provide inputs based on the 
environments you use and protect sensitive information. 
For example, if you're authenticating HTTP actions with 
[Azure Active Directory](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#connector-authentication), 
define and secure the parameters that accept the client 
ID and client secret used for authentication. For these 
parameters, your logic app definition has its own `parameters` section.
To access parameter values during runtime, you can use the 
`@parameters('parameterName')` expression, which is provided 
by the [Workflow Definition Language](https://aka.ms/logicappsdocs). 

To protect parameters and values you don't want shown when 
editing your logic app or viewing run history, you can define 
parameters with the `securestring` type and use encoding as necessary. 
Parameters that have this type aren't returned with the resource definition, 
and aren't accessible when viewing the resource after deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a parameter in a request's headers or body, 
> that parameter might be visible when accessing your 
> logic app's run history and outgoing HTTP request. 
> Make sure you also set your content access policies accordingly.
> Authorization headers are never visible through inputs or outputs. 
> So if a secret is used there, that secret isn't retrievable.

For more information about securing parameters in logic app definitions, see 
[Secure parameters in logic app definitions](#secure-parameters-workflow) 
later on this page.

If you're automating deployments with 
[Azure Resource Manager deployment templates](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates.md#parameters), 
you can also use secured parameters in those templates. 
For example, you can use parameters for getting KeyVault 
secrets when creating your logic app. Your deployment 
template definition has its own `parameters` section, 
separate from your logic app's `parameters` section. 
For more information about securing parameters in deployment templates, see 
[Secure parameters in deployment templates](#secure-parameters-deployment-template) 
later on this page.

<a name="secure-parameters-workflow"></a>

### Secure parameters in logic app definitions

To protect sensitive information in your logic app 
workflow definition, use secured parameters so this 
information isn't visible after you save your logic app. 
For example, suppose you're using `Basic` authentication 
in an HTTP action definition. This example includes a 
`parameters` section that defines the parameters for the 
action definition plus an `authentication` section that 
accepts `username` and `password` parameter values. 
To provide values for these parameters, you can use 
a separate parameters file, for example:

```json
"definition": {
   "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#",
   "actions": {
      "HTTP": {
         "type": "Http",
         "inputs": {
            "method": "GET",
            "uri": "https://www.microsoft.com",
            "authentication": {
               "type": "Basic",
               "username": "@parameters('usernameParam')",
               "password": "@parameters('passwordParam')"
            }
         },
         "runAfter": {}
      }
   },
   "parameters": {
      "passwordParam": {
         "type": "securestring"
      },
      "userNameParam": {
         "type": "securestring"
      }
   },
   "triggers": {
      "manual": {
         "type": "Request",
         "kind": "Http",
         "inputs": {
            "schema": {}
         }
      }
   },
   "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
   "outputs": {}
}
```

If you use secrets, you can get those secrets at deployment time by using 
[Azure Resource Manager KeyVault](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-keyvault-parameter.md).

<a name="secure-parameters-deployment-template"></a>

### Secure parameters in Azure Resource Manager deployment templates

This example shows a Resource Manager deployment template that 
uses more than one runtime parameter with the `securestring` type:

* `armTemplatePasswordParam`, which is input for the 
   logic app definition's `logicAppWfParam` parameter

* `logicAppWfParam`, which is input for the HTTP action 
  using basic authentication

This example includes an inner `parameters` section, 
which belongs to your logic app's workflow definition, 
and an outer `parameters` section, which belongs to 
your deployment template. To specify the environment 
values for parameters, you can use a separate parameters file. 

```json
{
   "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",

         "type": "securestring"
      },

            }
         }
      }
   ],
   "outputs": {}
}
```

If you use secrets, you can get those secrets at deployment time by using 
[Azure Resource Manager KeyVault](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-keyvault-parameter.md).

## Secure access to services receiving requests

Here are some ways you can secure any endpoint where your logic app needs access and sends requests.

### Add authentication on outbound requests

When working with an HTTP, HTTP + Swagger (Open API), or Webhook action, 
you can add authentication to the request sent by your logic app. 
For example, you can use basic authentication, certificate authentication, 
or Azure Active Directory authentication. For more information, 
see [Authenticate triggers or actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#connector-authentication).

### Restrict access to logic app IP addresses

All calls from logic apps come from specific designated 
IP addresses based on region. You can add filtering 
that accepts requests only from those IP addresses. 
For those IP addresses, see 
[Limits and configuration for Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#configuration).

### Secure on-premises connectivity

Azure Logic Apps provides integration with these services 
for secure and reliable on-premises communication.

#### On-premises data gateway

Many managed connectors for Azure Logic Apps provide 
secure connections to on-premises systems, 
such as File System, SQL, SharePoint, DB2, and others. 
The gateway sends data from on-premises sources 
on encrypted channels through the Azure Service Bus. 
All traffic originates as secure outbound traffic 
from the gateway agent. Learn [how the on-premises data gateway works](logic-apps-gateway-install.md#gateway-cloud-service).

#### Azure API Management

[Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/) 
provides on-premises connection options, such as 
site-to-site virtual private network and ExpressRoute 
integration for secured proxy and communication to on-premises systems. 
In the Logic App Designer, you can select an API exposed by 
API Management from your logic app's workflow, providing quick 
access to on-premises systems.
