# Azure security baseline for Azure Logic Apps

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Logic Apps contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see the [Azure security baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23180).

**Guidance**: Connectors that run in the "global," multi-tenant Logic Apps service are deployed and managed by Microsoft. These connectors provide triggers and actions for accessing cloud services, on-premises systems, or both, including Office 365, Azure Blob Storage, SQL Server, Dynamics, Salesforce, SharePoint, and more.

For logic apps that need direct access to resources in an Azure virtual network, you can create an isolated integration service environment (ISE) where you can build, deploy, and run your logic apps on dedicated resources. Some Azure virtual networks use private endpoints (Azure Private Link) for providing access to Azure PaaS services, such as Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, or Azure SQL Database, partner services, or customer services that are hosted on Azure. If your logic apps need access to virtual networks that use private endpoints, you must create, deploy, and run those logic apps inside an ISE.

When you create your ISE, you can choose to use either internal or external access endpoints. Your selection determines whether request or webhook triggers on logic apps in your ISE can receive calls from outside your virtual network.

Ensure that all virtual network subnet deployments related to your ISE have a network security group applied with network access controls specific to your application's trusted ports and sources. When available, use Private Endpoints with Private Link to secure your Azure service resources to your virtual network by extending virtual network identity to the service. When Private Endpoints and Private Link not available, use Service Endpoints. Alternatively, if you have a specific use case, requirement may be met by implementing Azure Firewall. For service specific requirements, please refer to the security recommendation for that specific service.

### 1.2: Monitor and log theconfiguration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23181).

**Guidance**: If you are running logic apps in an integration service environment (ISE) and choose to use external access points, you can use a network security group (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into a Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23187).

**Guidance**: For resources that need access to your Azure Logic Apps instances, use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., LogicApps, LogicAppsManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23188).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources related to your Azure Logic Apps instances with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Logic" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Logic apps instances. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions such as:

Diagnostic logs in Logic Apps should be enabled

DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, role-based access control (RBAC), and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

**Guidance**: Use an Azure app registration (service principal) to retrieve a token that can be used to interact with your Recovery Services vaults via API calls.

[Many connectors also require that you first create a connection to the target service or system and provide authentication credentials or other configuration details before you can use a trigger or action in your logic app. For example, you must authorize a connection to a Twitter account for accessing data or to post on your behalf.

For connectors that use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) OAuth, creating a connection means signing into the service, such as Office 365, Salesforce, or GitHub, where your access token is encrypted and securely stored in an Azure secret store. Other connectors, such as FTP and SQL, require a connection that has configuration details, such as the server address, username, and password. These connection configuration details are also encrypted and securely stored.]

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23215).

**Guidance**: Connectors that run in the "global," multi-tenant Logic Apps service are deployed and managed by Microsoft. These connectors provide triggers and actions for accessing cloud services, on-premises systems, or both, including Office 365, Azure Blob Storage, SQL Server, Dynamics, Salesforce, SharePoint, and more.

For logic apps that need direct access to resources in an Azure virtual network, you can create an isolated integration service environment (ISE) where you can build, deploy, and run your logic apps on dedicated resources. Some Azure virtual networks use private endpoints (Azure Private Link) for providing access to Azure PaaS services, such as Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, or Azure SQL Database, partner services, or customer services that are hosted on Azure. If your logic apps need access to virtual networks that use private endpoints, you must create, deploy, and run those logic apps inside an ISE.

When you create your ISE, you can choose to use either internal or external access endpoints. Your selection determines whether request or webhook triggers on logic apps in your ISE can receive calls from outside your virtual network.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23217).

**Guidance**: In order to accomplish tasks, Logic Apps uses connectors to interface with customer data. During a logic app run, all the data is encrypted during transit by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and at rest.

Each connector's triggers and actions provide their own properties for you to configure. Many connectors also require that you first create a connection to the target service or system and provide authentication credentials or other configuration details before you can use a trigger or action in your logic app.

For actions that handle any passwords, secrets, keys, or other sensitive information, you want to prevent others from viewing and accessing that data. you can restrict access by IP address range and secure data in run history by using obfuscation.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23219).

**Guidance**: You can permit only specific users or groups to run specific tasks, such as managing, editing, and viewing logic apps. To control their permissions, use Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) so that you can assign customized or built-in roles to the members in your Azure subscription:
- Logic App Contributor: Lets you manage logic apps, but you can't change access to them.
- Logic App Operator: Lets you read, enable, and disable logic apps, but you can't edit or update them.

To prevent others from changing or deleting your logic app, you can use Azure Resource Lock. This capability prevents others from changing or deleting production resources.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23221).

**Guidance**: Azure Logic Apps relies on Azure Storage to store and automatically encrypt data at rest. This encryption protects your data and helps you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. By default, Azure Storage uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt your data.

When you create an integration service environment (ISE) for hosting your logic apps, and you want more control over the encryption keys used by Azure Storage, you can set up, use, and manage your own key by using Azure Key Vault. This capability is also known as "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK), and your key is called a "customer-managed key".

**Guidance**: To easily access other resources that are protected by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and authenticate your identity without signing in, your logic app can use a managed identity (formerly Managed Service Identity or MSI), rather than credentials or secrets. Azure manages this identity for you and helps secure your credentials because you don't have to provide or rotate secrets.

Currently, only specific built-in triggers and actions support managed identities, not managed connectors or connections, for example:
- HTTP
- Azure Functions
- Azure API Management

> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23260).

**Guidance**: Your disaster recovery strategy should focus on setting up your primary logic app to failover onto a standby or backup logic app in an alternate location where Azure Logic Apps is also available. That way, if the primary suffers losses, disruptions, or failures, the secondary can take on the work. This strategy requires that your secondary logic app and dependent resources are already deployed and ready in the alternate location.

Enable Soft-Delete and purge protection in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion.

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23261).

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/23262).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
