# FAQ: Custom API connectors for Azure Logic Apps

## Requirements

**Q:** I'm not an ISV, so can I still build a connector? </br>
**A:** To publicly release a connector,
you must either own the underlying service or present explicit rights to use the API.

**Q:** Can I build a connector without REST APIs? </br>
**A:** No, to build an API connector, you must support stable HTTP REST APIs for your service. 

**Q:** What tools can I use to create a connector? </br>
**A:** Azure has capabilities and services that you can use for exposing any service as an API, 
such as Azure App Service for hosting, API Management, and more.

**Q:** What authentication types are supported? </br>
**A:** You can use these supported authentication standards:

* OAuth2.0, which includes Azure Active Directory
* API Key
* Basic Authentication

## Triggers

**Q:** Can I build triggers without webhooks? </br>
**A:** API connectors for Azure Logic Apps and Flow let you build webhook-based triggers only. 
If you want to request other patterns for implementation, 
contact [condevhelp@microsoft.com](mailto:condevhelp@microsoft.com) 
with more details about your API.

## Other

**Q:** My APIs use a dynamic host. How do I implement them with OpenAPI? </br>
**A:** The API connector feature doesn't support dynamic hosts. 
Please use a static host for development and testing purposes. 
During submission, talk to your Microsoft contact regarding the dynamic implementation.

**Q:** Do you support Postman Collection V2? </br>
**A:** No, only Postman Collection V1 is currently supported.

**Q:** Do you support OpenAPI 3.0? </br>
**A:** No, only OpenAPI 2.0 is currently supported.
