# Troubleshoot usage analytics in Application Insights
Have questions about the [usage analytics tools in Application Insights](app-insights-usage-overview.md): [Users, Sessions, Events](app-insights-usage-segmentation.md), [Funnels](usage-funnels.md), [User Flows](app-insights-usage-flows.md), [Retention](app-insights-usage-retention.md), or Cohorts? Here are some answers.

## Counting Users
**The usage analytics tools show that my app has one user, but I know my app has many users. How can I fix this?**

* TBD answer.

## Naming Events
**My app has thousands of different page view, custom event, and request names. It's hard to distinguish between them, and the usage analytics tools often become unresponsive. How can I fix this?**

* TBD answer.
