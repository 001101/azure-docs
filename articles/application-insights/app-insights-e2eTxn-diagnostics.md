# Unified Cross Component Transaction Diagnostics
*This experience is currently in preview and replaces the existing server side diagnostics blades*

This preview introduces a new unified diagnostics experience with correlated server side telemetry across all components into a single full screen Gantt chart and detailes pane. You can diagnose the application component, external dependency or exception that caused the transaction to be slow or fail with all related telemetry. You do not need to navigate to other Application Insights resources (for the other components), or load more UI to get to the details. All of the diagnostic detail from all components is readily available on the right pane with a single click.

## A note on Components
Components are independently deployable units of your distributed/microservices application. You have code-level visibility or access to telemetry generated by these application components. 

* These are different from "observed" external dependencies such as SQL, EventHub etc. which your team/organization would typically not have access to (code or telemetry).
* Components run on any number of server/role/container instances.
* Components can be separate Application Insights instrumentation keys (in different subscriptions for that matter) or different roles reporting to a single Application Insights instrumentation key. This experience will show the detail across all components regardless of how they have been set up, so long as you have the right permissions.

> [!Tip]
> For best results, ensure all components are instrumented with the latest Application Insights stable SDKs. Also, if they are different Application Insights resources, ensure you have appropriate rights to view their telemetry.

## Enable and Access
Enable "Unified details: E2E Transaction Diagnostics" from the [preview experiences list](app-insights-previews.md)

![Enable preview](media/app-insights-e2eTxn-diagnostics/previews.png)

You can access the new experience from Search results, or request, dependency or exception details from the Performance or Failure triage experiences. The preview replaces the corresponding classic details blades.

## Transaction Diagnostics Experience 
This view has 3 key parts: a cross component transaction chart of requests, dependencies and exceptions, a time-sequence list of all telemetry from a specific component-operation, and the details pane for any selected telemetry item on the left.

![Key parts](media/app-insights-e2eTxn-diagnostics/3partsCrossComponent.png)

**1. End-to-end Transaction Chart**
 
 This provides a timeline with horizontal bars (like a Gantt chart) for the duration of requests and dependencies across the components that were invoked in this transaction. Any exceptions collected are also marked on the timeline. 
 
 * The top row on this chart represents the entrypoint., the incoming request to the 1st component called in this transaction. The duration is the total time taken for the transaction to complete.
 * Any calls to external dependencies are simple non-collapsible rows, with icons representing the dependency type.
 * Calls to other components are collapsible rows. Each row corresponds to a specific operation invoked at the component.
 * By default, the request, dependency or exception that you had clicked on to arrive here, will be selected on the chart.
 * Select any row to see its details on the right. Clicking on the profiler icon on a request row, or debug snapshot icon on an exception row will open respective detail.

> [!NOTE] 
Calls to other components have 2 rows: one representing the outbound call (dependency) from the caller component., and the other is the inbound request at the called component. The latter is called localhost to help differentiate between them. Use the top-right corner feedback channel to let us know if you find this useful or otherwise.

**2. Time sequenced Telemetry of the selected Component-Operation**

Any row selected in the End-to-end Transaction Chart is related to an operation invoked at a particular component. This selected Component-Operation is reflected in the title of the bottom section. Open this section to see a flat time-sequence of all the telemetry related to that particular operation. You can select any telemetry item in this list to see corresponding details on the right.

**3. Details Pane**

This pane shows the detail of selected item from either of the 2 sections on the left. "Show all" lists all of the standard attributes collected. Any custom attributes are separately listed below the standard set.

## Profiler and Snapshot debugger
[Application Insights profiler](app-insights-profiler.md) or [Snapshot debugger](app-insights-snapshot-debugger.md) help with code level diagnostics of performance and failure issues. If they are configured for any of the components in the transaction, you can open the respective traces by clicking on the icons on the left chart or the links at the top of the right pane.

## FAQ
1. *I see a single component on the chart, the others are only showing as external dependencies without any detail of what happened within those components.*

Potential reasons why this may be happening:
* Are the other components instrumented with Application Insights?
* Are they using the latest stable Application Insights SDK? 
* If these components are separate Application Insights resources, do you have required access to them?
If you do have access and the components are instrumented with the latest Application Insights SDKs, please reach out to us via the top right feedback channel and we will investigate.

2. *I only have external dependencies. Should I care for this preview?*

Yes. The new experience unifies all related server side telemetry into a single view. The older detail blades will be replaced by this experience in the future, so try it out and give us your feedback. Here's what it looks like for a single component transaction:

3. *I see duplicate rows for the dependencies..*

At this time, we are showing the outbound dependency call from the caller and the inbound request at the called component separately. Typically, the 2 look identical with only a duration difference from the network round trip. To help distinguish between the 2, we are calling the component receiving the request "localhost" with a server icon. This row will immediately follow the dependency row. Is this confusing? Give us your feedback!

4. *What about clock skews across different component instances..?*

We are automatically adjusting timelines for the clock skews in the transaction chart. You can see the exact timestamps in the details pane or using Analytics. 

5. *This new experience is missing most of the related items queries?*

By design. All of the related items, indeed across all components are already available on the left side (top and bottom sections). The new experience has 2 related items which the left side doesn't cover: all telemetry from 5 minutes before and after this event & the user timeline.

6. *This new experience does not have X that I loved in the older blades..*

Give us feedback, let us know! We want to address your concerns before this experience is generally available at which time the older blades will be deprecated. For now, you can disable the preview to go back to the older blades.

## Known Issues
* The failures samples from Application Map link to the older detail blades.
* The autocluster based insights in the search results link to the older detail blades.
* Work item integration is not available from the new experience.
