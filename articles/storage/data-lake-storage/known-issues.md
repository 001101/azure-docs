# Known issues with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

This article contains known issues and temporary limitations with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## APIs for Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 are not interoperable

Blob Storage APIs and Azure Data Lake Gen2 APIs are not interoperable with each other. This means that content you upload by using Blob storage APIs (or by using features that call Blob storage APIs) won't be accessible to any code or features that call Azure Data Lake Gen2 APIs and vice versa.

If you need a single tool set or API to work with all content that you upload to your Blob storage account, then don't enable hierarchical namespaces on your Blob storage account until these APIs become interoperable. Using a storage account without the hierarchical namespace means you then do not have access to Data Lake Storage Gen2 specific features, such as directory and filesystem ACLs.

## Blob storage APIs aren't yet available to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 accounts

An Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 account is a Blob Storage account that uses hierarchical namespaces. If you enable hierarchical namespaces, then all Blob API operations for that storage account are disabled. These APIs have been disabled to prevent inadvertent data access issues that could arise because Blob Storage APIs are not yet interoperable with Azure Data Lake Gen2 APIs.

Unmanaged Virtual Machine (VM) disks depend upon these API operations, so if you want to enable hierarchical namespaces on a storage account, consider placing unmanaged VM disks into a storage account that does not have hierarchical namespaces enabled. 

To restore Blob API operations, just disable hierarchical namespace on the storage account. 

## Azure Storage Explorer has only limited support for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Some features in Storage Explorer don't yet with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 file systems. These limitations apply to both the [stand-alone version](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) of Azure Storage Explorer as well as the version that appears in the Azure Portal.

## Blob viewing tool on Azure Portal has only limited support for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Need something here.

## Third-party applications might not support Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Support for Azure Data Lake Gen2 is at the discretion of each third-party application provider. Currently, Blob storage APIs and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 APIs can't be used to manage the same content. This might be the cause of some issues with third-party tools. As we work to enable that interoperability, it's possible that many third party tools will automatically support Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## AzCopy version 8 doesnâ€™t support Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Instead, use the latest preview version of AzCopy ( [AzCopy v10](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ftables%2ftoc.json) ). AzCopy V10 supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 endpoints.

## OAuth authentication has limited support

Integration for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) OAuth bearer token authentication isn't yet available in services such as Azure Databricks, HDInsight and Azure Data Factory.

## Directory and file-level access control lists (ACL) are difficult to manage

There is no UI-based tool that helps you to get and set access control lists for directories and files of an Azure Data Lake Gen2 file system.

## Azure Event Grid does not receive events from Azure Data Lake Gen2 accounts

Azure Data Lake Gen 2 accounts don't yet generate events so you can't use the [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/) to handle them.

## Role Based Access Control can't be applied to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

You can't apply Role Based Access Control to file system objects in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.

## SQL Data Warehouse PolyBase can't access Storage accounts that have Storage firewalls enabled

When Storage Firewalls are enabled on an Azure Storage account, SQL Data Warehouse [Polybase](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/polybase/polybase-guide?view=sql-server-2017) can't access those accounts.

## Soft delete and snapshots aren't available for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts

All versioning features including [snapshots](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/creating-a-snapshot-of-a-blob) and [soft delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete) aren't yet available for Storage accounts that have hierarchical namespaces enabled.

## Object level storage tiers aren't yet available for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 accounts

Object level tiers (Hot, Cold, and Archive) are available to Storage accounts don't have hierarchical spaces enabled.

## Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management (Preview) policies aren't yet available for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts

These policies are available to Storage accounts don't have hierarchical spaces enabled.

## Diagnostic logs aren't available for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts

To request diagnostic logs, contact Azure Support. Provide them with your account name and the period of time for which you require logs.
