# Evaluating Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 offers rich support for the Hadoop Compatible File System and a full hierarchical namespace, just as Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 does. Additionally, Data Lake Storage Gen2 includes all of the powerful features of Azure Blobs, such as data tiering and lifecycle management, durability options for high availability and DR, event grid support, enhanced network security, and compatibility with all Blob APIs.

You can evaluate Data Lake Storage Gen2 without affecting your existing Data Lake Storage Gen1 applications or workloads. Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Gen1 can be used side by side, so your existing resources will remain fully functional. Any new resources can be deployed using either Gen1 or Gen2. Existing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 customers will be fully supported indefinitely on the existing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 platform, allowing customers to plan their migration to Data Lake Storage Gen2 at their convenience.

Data Lake Storage Gen2 is available as a limited public preview. If you're interested, we [invite you to participate](https://aka.ms/adlsgen2signup) so you can begin evaluating Data Lake Storage Gen2 and provide feedback.
