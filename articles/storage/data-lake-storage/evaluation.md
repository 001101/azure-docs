# Guidance for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 customers

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Preview represents the next step for Data Lake Storage Gen1. Data Lake Storage Gen2 takes the same rich support for the Hadoop Compatible File System that Data Lake Storage Gen1 has and incorporates additional functionality like data tiering, lifecycle management, event grid support, enhanced network security, and If you are either an existing Data Lake Storage Gen1 customer or a prospective customer, we ask that you please evaluate Data Lake Gen2 by creating a POC and testing it out.

Existing Data Lake Storage Gen1 users will continue to be supported indefinitely

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 offers the same rich support for the Hadoop Compatible File System and a full hierarchical namespace just like Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 does. Additionally, it brings all of Azure Blobs offerings to the table so functionality like data tiering and lifecycle management, durability options for HA and DR, event grid support, enhanced network security, and compatibility with all of Blob APIs.

Should you decide to evaluate Data Lake Storage Gen2, nothing will interfere with your existing applications or workloads. Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Gen1 are not mutually exclusive so your existing resources will remain fully functional and any new resources can be deployed using either Gen1 or Gen2. Existing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 customers will be fully supported indefinitely on the existing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 platform, allowing customers to plan their migration to ADLSv2 at their convenience.

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is available as a limited public preview. If you're interested, we [invite you to participate](https://aka.ms/adlsgen2signup) so you can begin evaluating Data Lake Storage Gen2 and provide feedback.
