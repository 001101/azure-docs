# Guidance for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 customers

Data Lake Storage Gen2 Preview provides you Blob Storage native functionality such as: data tiering, lifecycle management, event grid support, and enhanced network security in addition to the Hadoop Compatible file system provided in Data Lake Storage Gen1.

If you are an existing Data Lake Storage Gen1 customer, we encourage you to evaluate all the new and enhanced capabilites of Data Lake Storage Gen2, and provide feedback by [participating in the preview](https://aka.ms/adlsgen2signup). Also, Data Lake Storage Gen1 will continue to be supported. Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Gen2 can coexist, so your existing resources and applications that leverage Gen1 will remain functional. This will allow you to develop a migration plan to Data Lake Storage Gen2 at your convenience.

If you are currently evaluating Data Lake Storage Gen1, we encourage you to participate in the Gen2 preview and evaluate the new and enhanced capabilities offered by Data Lake Storage Gen2. Similarly, if you are an existing Blob customer, we encourage you to evaluate if a Hadoop Compatible file system is appropriate for your analytic needs.
