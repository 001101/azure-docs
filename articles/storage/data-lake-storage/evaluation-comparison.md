# Evaluating Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

The table in this article summarizes the differences between Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. It documents what is currently available and will be updated as features are integrated over the course of its preview.

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 offers the same rich support for the Hadoop Compatible File System and a full hierarchical namespace just like Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 does. Additionally, it brings all of Azure Blobs offerings to the table so functionality like data tiering and lifecycle management, durability options for HA and DR, event grid support, enhanced network security, and compatibility with all of Blob APIs.

Should you decide to evaluate Data Lake Storage Gen2, nothing will interfere with your existing applications or workloads. Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Gen1 are not mutually exclusive so your existing resources will remain fully functional and any new resources can be deployed using either Gen1 or Gen2. Existing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 customers will be fully supported indefinitely on the existing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 platform, allowing customers to plan their migration to ADLSv2 at their convenience.

**Next steps**

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is available as a limited public preview, with general availability in CY2018Q4. If you're interested, we [invite you to participate](https://aka.ms/adlsgen2signup) so you can begin evaluating Data Lake Storage Gen2 and provide feedback through the private yammer.
