# Point-in-time restore for block blobs (preview)

Azure Storage administrators can use point-in-time restore (preview) for block blobs to restore a container to a previous state. Point-in-time restore is useful in scenarios where a user or application accidentally deletes data or where an application error corrupts data. Point-in-time restore also enables testing scenarios that require returning a data set to a known state before running further tests.
