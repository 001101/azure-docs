# Configure NTFS permissions over SMB 

Before you begin this article, make sure you completed the previous article, [Assign access permissions to an identity](storage-files-identity-ad-ds-assign-permissions.md). To ensure that your share-level permissions are in place.

After you assign share-level permissions with RBAC, you must assign proper NTFS permissions at the root, directory, or file level. Think of share-level permissions as the high-level gatekeeper that determines whether a user can access the share. Whereas NTFS permissions act at a more granular level to determine what operations the user can do at the directory or file level.

Azure Files supports the full set of NTFS basic and advanced permissions. You can view and configure NTFS permissions on directories and files in an Azure file share by mounting the share and then using Windows File Explorer or running the Windows [icacls](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls) or [Set-ACL](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-acl) command. 

To configure NTFS with superuser permissions, you must mount the share by using your storage account key from your domain-joined VM. Follow the instructions in the next section to mount an Azure file share from the command prompt and to configure NTFS permissions accordingly.

The following permissions are supported on the root directory of a file share:

- BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(F)
- NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(F)
- BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
- BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
- NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(M)
- NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
- CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)

## Mount a file share from the command prompt

Use the Windows **net use** command to mount the Azure file share. Remember to replace the placeholder values in the following example with your own values. For more information about mounting file shares, see [Use an Azure file share with Windows](../articles/storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-windows.md). 

```
net use <desired-drive-letter>: \\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name> /user:Azure\<storage-account-name> <storage-account-key>
```

If you experience issues in connecting to Azure Files, please refer to [the troubleshooting tool we published for Azure Files mounting errors on Windows](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Troubleshooting-tool-for-a9fa1fe5). We also provide [guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-faq#on-premises-access) to work around scenarios when port 445 is blocked. 


### Configure NTFS permissions with Windows File Explorer

Use Windows File Explorer to grant full permission to all directories and files under the file share, including the root directory.

1. Open Windows File Explorer and right click on the file/directory and select **Properties**.
1. Select the **Security** tab.
1. Select **Edit..** to change permissions.
1. You can change the permissions of existing users or select **Add...** to grant permissions to new users.
1. In the prompt window for adding new users, enter the target user name you want to grant permission to in the **Enter the object names to select** box, and select **Check Names** to find the full UPN name of the target user.
1.    Select **OK**.
1.    In the **Security** tab, select all permissions you want to grant your new user.
1.    Select **Apply**.

## Configure NTFS permissions with icacls

Use the following Windows command to grant full permissions to all directories and files under the file share, including the root directory. Remember to replace the placeholder values in the example with your own values.

```
icacls <mounted-drive-letter>: /grant <user-email>:(f)
```

For more information on how to use icacls to set NTFS permissions and on the different types of supported permissions, see [the command-line reference for icacls](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls).
