# Enable Azure Active Directory integration with Azure Files (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-aad-integration-include](../../../includes/storage-files-aad-integration-include.md)]

For an overview of Azure AD integration with Azure Files, see [Overview of Azure Active Directory integration with Azure Files (Preview)](storage-files-active-directory-overview.md).

## Workflow overview

The diagram below illustrates the end-to-end workflow to enable Azure AD integration with Azure Files for access to shares, directories, or files. To enable Azure AD integration, first verify that your Azure AD and Azure Storage environments are properly configured. It's strongly recommended that you walk through the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and make sure that you've performed all of the required steps. 

Next, grant access to Azure Files resources with Azure AD credentials in three steps: 

1. Enable Azure AD Integration for Azure Files.
2. Assign user permissions using RBAC.
3. Access an Azure file share with Azure AD credentials.

## Prerequisites 

1.  **Select or create your Azure AD tenant.**

    Select your target Azure AD tenant. You will deploy your file share under a subscription associated with this Azure AD tenant. If you don't yet have an existing
    Azure AD tenant, you can [Add an Azure AD tenant and an Azure AD subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/add-an-azure-ad-tenant-and-azure-ad-subscription). If you have an existing Azure AD tenant but want to create a new tenant for use with Azure Files, see [Create an Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/datacatalog/create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant).

2.  **Enable Azure AD Domain Services on your Azure AD tenant.**

    To support authentication with Azure AD credentials, you must enable Azure AD Domain Services for your Azure AD tenant. If you aren't the administrator of the Azure AD tenant, contact the administrator and follow the step-by-step guidance to [Enable Azure Active Directory Domain Services using the Azure portal](../../active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-getting-started.md).

    It typically takes about 15 minutes for an Azure AD Domain Services deployment to complete. Make sure that the health status of your Azure AD Domain Services shows **Running** before proceeding to the next step.

3.  **Domain-join your Azure VM to Azure AD Domain Services.**

    To access Azure file shares using Azure AD credentials from an Azure VM, your VM must be domain-joined to Azure AD Domain Services. For more information about how to domain-join a VM, see [Join a Windows Server virtual machine to a managed domain](../../active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-admin-guide-join-windows-vm-portal.md).

4.  **Select or create your new Azure file share.**

    Azure AD integration with Azure Files is supported for the primary Azure AD tenant. The primary Azure AD tenant is the tenant that is associated with the subscription in which the file share is deployed. You can select an existing file share or [Create a file share in Azure Files](storage-how-to-create-file-share.md) under your target Azure AD tenant. 

    For optimal performance, Microsoft recommends that you deploy your file share to the same region as the VMs from which you plan to access the share.

5.  **Verify Azure Files connectivity by mounting Azure file shares using storage account key.**

    To verify that your VM and file share are properly configured, try mounting the file share using your storage account key. For more information, see [Mount an Azure file share and access the share in Windows](storage-how-to-use-files-windows.md).

## Enable Azure AD integration for Azure Files SMB access

Before you proceed to the following steps to enable Azure AD integration for Azure Files, review the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and ensure that your Azure AD tenant is properly configured, that your VM is domain-joined through Azure AD Domain Services, and that you can mount a file share and access it using your account key.

### Step 1: Enable Azure AD integration for Azure Files on your storage account

To enable Azure AD integration with Azure Files for your storage account, you can set a property on the storage account using the Azure Storage Resources Provider. Setting the property registers the storage account with the associated Azure AD Domain Services to support Kerberos authentication with Azure AD credentials and enables Azure AD integration for all new and existing file shares deployed under this storage account. You can set this property using PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the Storage Resource Provider REST API. 

You can update the storage account property using [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) with the [storage account template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.storage/storageaccounts)(Private Preview)???, or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Azure PowerShell (Preview), or Azure CLI (Preview).

**Powershell**

To enable Azure AD integration with Azure Files from Azure PowerShell, call the [Set-AzureRmStorageAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.storage/set-azurermstorageaccount) and set the **EnableAzureFilesAadIntegration** parameter to **true**.

Remember to replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<storage-account-name>` with your own values.

```powershell
Set-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "<resource-group-name>" -Name "<storage-account-name>" -EnableAzureFilesAadIntegration \$true
```

**CLI**

???still need CLI cmd???

**REST**

To enable Azure AD integration with Azure Files from REST, call the [Create Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storagerp/storageaccounts/create) or [Update Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storagerp/storageaccounts/update) operation in the Storage Resource Provider REST API. Include the property **azureFilesAadIntegration** in the JSON payload and set it to **true**.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "azureFilesAadIntegration":true, 
    …
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Assign permissions to a user with superuser privileges 

To access Azure Files using Azure AD credentials, a user must have the required permissions on share, directory, and file levels. The step-by-step guidance
below demonstrates how to assign superuser or administrator permissions to a user to grant ownership permissions to a file share. You can follow the same workflow to assign permissions at different levels to other users, groups, or service principals.

#### Step 2.1: Assign share-level permissions

Use [RBAC](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) to define share-level access for users, groups, and service principals. This process is similar to assigning Windows file share permissions, where you specify the type of access that users have to the file share. 

Azure Files supports two RBAC roles that define permissions to access Azure file shares: 

- **Storage Files Data Contributor:** Grants read, write, and delete access to an Azure file share.
- **Storage Files Data Reader:** Grants read access to an Azure file share. 

You can also apply existing roles such as Owner, Contributor, and Reader to grant broader permissions at the share level.

**Powershell**

The following PowerShell command assigns an RBAC role to an Azure AD user, based on the user's sign-in name. To learn more about assigning RBAC roles with PowerShell, see [Manage access using RBAC and Azure PowerShell](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell.md). 

```powershell
New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -SignInName <user-email> -RoleDefinitionName <role-name-in-quotes> -Scope <resource-id>
```

For example:

```powershell
PS C:\> New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -SignInName <john.doe@contoso.com> -RoleDefinitionName "Owner" `
-Scope "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000000000000000/resourceGroups/aadintegration/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/testaccount/"
```

**CLI**

The following command assigns an RBAC role to an Azure AD user, based on the user's sign-in name. To learn more about assigning RBAC roles with Azure CLI, see [Manage access using RBAC and Azure CLI](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli.md). 

```cli
az role assignment create --role <role-name-in-quotes> --assignee <user-email> --scope <resource-id>
```

For example:

```cli
az role assignment create --role "Owner" --assignee <john.doe@contoso.com> –scope "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/aadintegration/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/testaccount/"
```

#### Step 2.2: ConfigureNTFS permissions with icacls over SMB 

After you assign share-level permissions with RBAC, you must assign proper NTFS permissions at the root, directory, or file level. Think of share-level permissions as the high-level gatekeeper that determines whether a user can access the share, while NTFS permissions act at a more granular level to determine what operations the user can perform at the directory or file level. 

Azure Files supports the full set of NTFS basic and advance permissions. You can view and configure NTFS permissions on directories and files in an Azure file share by mounting the share and then running the Windows [icacls](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls) command. You can also use [robocopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy) or another copy tool to copy files together with their ACLs.

If you have just enabled Azure AD integration with Azure Files, you may not yet have any Azure AD users with NTFS permissions configured at the root directory of the file share. In this case, you first need to mount the share with your storage account key to your domain-joined VM. You can then assign permissions with superuser privileges. Follow the instructions in the next section to mount an Azure file share from the command prompt.

#### **Step 2.2.1 Mount an Azure file share from the command prompt** 

Use the **net use** command to mount the Azure file share. Remember to replace `<desired-drive-letter>`, `<storage-account-name>`, `<share-name>`, `<storage-account-key>`, and `<storage-account-name>` with your own values. For more information about mounting file shares, see [Mount an Azure file share and access the share in Windows](storage-how-to-use-files-windows.md).

```
net use <desired-drive-letter>: \\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name> <storage-account-key> /user:Azure\<storage-account-name>
```

**Step 2.2.2 Configure NTFS permissions with icacls**

Use the following command to grant full permissions to all directories and files under the file share, including the root directory. Remember to replace `<mounted-drive-letter>` and `<user-email>` with your own values.

```
icacls <mounted-drive-letter> /grant <user-email>:(f)
```

For more information on how to use icacls to set NTFS permissions and on the different type of permissions supported, see [the command-line reference for icacls](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls).


### Step 3: Mount an Azure file share from a domain-joined VM 

Now you are ready to use your Azure AD credentials to access an Azure file share from a domain-joined VM. First, sign in the VM using the name and password to which you have granted permissions, as shown in the following image.

![Screenshot showing sign in screen](media/storage-files-active-directory-enable/aad-auth-screen.png)

  
Next, use the following command to mount the Azure file share. Remember to replace `<desired-drive-letter>`, `<storage-account-name>`, and `<share-name>` with
your own values. Because you have already been authenticated, you do not need to provide the storage account key or the Azure AD user name and password. Azure AD integration with Azure Files supports a single sign-on experience using Azure AD credentials.

```
net use <desired-drive-letter>: \\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name>
```

You have now successfully enabled Azure AD integration for Azure Files and set up an administrative account to manage the assignment of permissions. If you need to grant access to your file share to additional users, follow the instructions provided in step 2.
