# Azure file share protocols

Azure Files offers two protocols for connecting and mounting your Azure file shares. [Server Message Block (SMB) protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa365233.aspx) and [Network File System (NFS) protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) (preview). Azure Files does not currently support multi-protocol access, so a share can only be either an NFS share, or an SMB share. Due to this, we recommend determining which protocol best suits your needs before creating Azure file shares.

## SMB shares

SMB description here.

### Features

- Azure file sync
- Identity-based authentication
- Azure Backup support
- Snapshots
- Soft delete
- Encryption-in-transit and encryption-at-rest

### Use cases

SMB with Azure Files is ideal for:

- Windows environments
- Customers that require any of the features listed in [Features](#features)
- Production environments

Do not use SMB if you need Unix style permissions (UID/GID), case sensitivity, or POSIX delete behavior.

## NFS shares (preview)

Azure Files offers NFS v4.1 protocol that is fully managed, network-attached storage. It is highly scalable, highly durable, and highly available. This is a fully POSIX-compliant offer that is a standard across variants of Unix and other *nix based operating systems. This enterprise-grade file storage service scales up to meet your storage needs and can be accessed concurrently by thousands of compute instances. You can start with a file system that contains only 100 GiB data to 100 TiB per volume. Moreover, your data and metadata are protected with encryption at rest by default. NFS is currently in preview and should not be used for production data.

### Limitations

[!INCLUDE [files-nfs-limitations](../../../includes/files-nfs-limitations.md)]

#### Regional availability

[!INCLUDE [files-nfs-regional-availability](../../../includes/files-nfs-regional-availability.md)]

### Best suited

NFS with Azure Files is ideal for:

- Linux environments.
- SAP
- Linux-centric workloads that do not require SMB access.
- Inherent locking system that you do not need to manage.
