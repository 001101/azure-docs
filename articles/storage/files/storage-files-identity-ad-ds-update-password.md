# Update the password of your storage account identity in AD DS

If you registered the AD DS identity/account representing your storage account under an OU that enforces password expiration time, you must rotate the password before the maximum password age. Failing to update the AD DS account password will result in authentication failures to access Azure file shares.  

To trigger password rotation, you can run the `Update-AzStorageAccountADObjectPassword` command from the [AzFilesHybrid module](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases). The cmdlet performs actions similar to storage account key rotation. It gets the second Kerberos key of the storage account and uses it to update the password of the registered account in AD DS. Then it regenerates the target Kerberos key of the storage account and updates the password of the registered account in AD DS. You must run this cmdlet in an on-premises AD DS domain joined environment.

```PowerShell
# Update the password of the AD DS account registered for the storage account
Update-AzStorageAccountADObjectPassword `
        -RotateToKerbKey kerb2 `
        -ResourceGroupName "<your-resource-group-name-here>" `
        -StorageAccountName "<your-storage-account-name-here>"
```
