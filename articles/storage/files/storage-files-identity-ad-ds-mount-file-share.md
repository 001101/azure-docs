# Mount a file share from a domain-joined VM

Before you begin this article, make sure you complete the previous article, [Configure NTFS permissions over SMB](storage-files-identity-ad-ds-configure-permissions.md).

The process described in this article verifies that your file share and access permissions were set up correctly and that you can access an Azure File share from a domain-joined VM. Be aware that the share-level RBAC role assignment can take some time to take effect. 

Sign in to the VM by using the AD DS credentials to which you have granted permissions, as shown in the following image.

Use the following command to mount the Azure file share. Remember to replaceÂ the placeholder values with your own values. Because you've been authenticated, you don't need to provide a credential. Single sign-on experience is supported for authentication with AD DS.

```
net use <desired-drive-letter>: \\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name>
```

If you run into issues mounting with AD DS credentials, refer to [Troubleshoot Azure Files problems in Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshoot-windows-file-connection-problems) for guidance.

At this point, if your mount succeeded, then you have successfully enabled and configured on-premises AD DS authentication for your Azure file shares.

The upcoming article contains instructions for updating your password, if your AD DS requires that you rotate your password, continue to the next article.
