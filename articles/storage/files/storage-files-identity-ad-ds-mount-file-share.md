# Part four: mount a file share from a domain-joined VM

Before you begin this article, make sure you complete the previous article, [Configure NTFS permissions over SMB](storage-files-identity-ad-ds-configure-permissions.md).

The process described in this article verifies that your file share and access permissions are set up correctly and that you can access an Azure File share from a domain-joined VM. Share-level RBAC role assignment can take some time to take effect. 

Sign in to the VM by using the AD DS credentials that you granted permissions, as shown in the following image.

ReplaceÂ the placeholder values with your own values, then use the following command to mount the Azure file share:

```
net use <desired-drive-letter>: \\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name>
```

If you run into issues mounting with AD DS credentials, refer to [Troubleshoot Azure Files problems in Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshoot-windows-file-connection-problems) for guidance.

If mounting your file share succeeded, then you have successfully enabled and configured on-premises AD DS authentication for your Azure file shares.

The following article contains instructions for updating your password, if your AD DS requires that you rotate your password, continue to the next article.
