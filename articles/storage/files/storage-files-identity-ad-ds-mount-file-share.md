# Part four: mount a file share from a domain-joined VM

Before you begin this article, make sure you complete the previous article, [Configure NTFS permissions over SMB](storage-files-identity-ad-ds-configure-permissions.md).

The process described in this article verifies that your file share and access permissions are set up correctly and that you can access an Azure File share from a domain-joined VM. Share-level RBAC role assignment can take some time to take effect. 

Sign in to the client by using the credentials that you granted permissions to, as shown in the following image.

ReplaceÂ the placeholder values with your own values, then use the following command to mount the Azure file share:

> [!NOTE]
> If you are mounting the file share from a client that has previously mounted the file share using your storage account key, make sure that you have disconnected the share, removed the persistent credentials of the storage account key, and are currently using AD DS credentials for authentication.



```
// Always mount your share using.file.core.windows.net, even if you setup a private endpoint for your share.
net use <desired-drive-letter>: \\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name>
```

If you run into issues mounting with AD DS credentials, refer to [Unable to mount Azure Files with AD credentials](storage-troubleshoot-windows-file-connection-problems.md#unable-to-mount-azure-files-with-ad-credentials) for guidance.

If mounting your file share succeeded, then you have successfully enabled and configured on-premises AD DS authentication for your Azure file shares.
