# Quickstart with files using CLI for Azure Storage Services
Introductory paragraph

Install CLI
Get CLI context
Create share
Create directory
Upload file
List files
Copy files

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 

az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

```

## Create a storage account

Create an Azure storage account with [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#create) to store the actual files.

To create a storage account named mystorageaccount by using the Standard_LRS storage SKU, use the following example:

```azurecli-interactive 
az storage account create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name mystorageaccount \
    --location westus \
    --sku Standard_LRS
```

## Get the storage account keys.

View the storage account keys with the [az storage account keys list](/cli/azure/storage/account/keys#list). The storage account keys for the named `mystorageaccount` are listed in the following example:

```azurecli-interactive 
az storage account keys list --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --account-name mystorageaccount
```

To extract a single key, use the `--query` flag. The following example extracts the first key (`[0]`):

```azurecli
az storage account keys list --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --account-name mystorageaccount \
    --query '[0].{Key:value}' --output tsv
```

## Create a file share.

An Azure File share is an SMB file share in Azure. All directories and files must be created in a file share. A storage account can contain an unlimited number of shares, and a share can store an unlimited number of files, up to the capacity limits of the storage account. 

Create the file share using [az storage share create](/cli/azure/storage/share#create). The quota is always expressed in gigabytes (GB). Pass in one of the keys from the preceding `az storage account keys list` command. This example Creates a share named *myshare* with a 10-GB quota. Be sure to enter your own account key in the last line.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage share create --name mystorageshare \
    --quota 10 \
    --account-name mystorageaccount \
    --account-key <snip - put account key here >
```

## Create directory

Adding a directory provides a hierarchical structure for managing your file share. You can create multiple levels, but you must ensure that all parent directories exist before creating a subdirectory. For example, for path dir1/dir2, you must first create directory dir1, then create directory dir2.

This example creates a directory named *myDirectory* in the file share called *myshare*.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage directory create --name myDirectory --share-name myshare
```
## Upload a file

You can upload a file from your local machine to your Azure file share. Because we are working with local files, you cannot use Cloud Shell for this example.

To upload a file,  use [az storage file upload](/cli/azure/storage/file#az_storage_file_upload).

To upload a batch of files, use [az storage file upload-batch](/cli/azure/storage/file#az_storage_file_upload-batch)


This example uploads a file from ~/temp/myfile.txt to root of the *myshare* file share. The **--source** argument specifies the existing local file to upload.

```azurecli
az storage file upload --share-name myshare --source ~/temp/samplefile.txt
```

You can also upload a file to a specific directory path within the share. This example uploads the  file *myfile.txt*  from *~/temp/* to the *myshare* file share, in the *mydirectory* directory.

```azurecli
az storage file upload --share-name myshare/mydirectory --source ~/temp/myfile.txt
```



## List files

To list all files, use [az storage file list](/cli/azure/storage/file#az_storage_file_list).


## Copy files

You can copy a file to another file, a file to a blob, or a blob to a file. To copy files, use [az storage file copy](/cli/azure/storage/file/copy). This example copies a file from share1 to the directory *dir2* in a share named *share2*. 

az storage file copy start \
--source-share share1 --source-path dir1/file.txt \
--destination-share share2 --destination-path dir2/file.txt

## Clean up resourcesT

When no longer needed, you can use [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#delete) to remove the resource group and all related resources. 

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```


## Next steps
In this quickstart, you've learned to create a storage account, create a share, create a directory, upload, and copy files.
