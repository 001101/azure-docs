Install CLI

Copy files

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## Create a storage account

Create an Azure storage account with [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#create) to store the actual files.

    To create a storage account named mystorageaccount by using the Standard_LRS storage SKU, use the following example:

    ```azurecli
    az storage account create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name mystorageaccount \
        --location westus \
        --sku Standard_LRS
    ```

## Get the storage account keys.

    View the storage account keys with the [az storage account keys list](/cli/azure/storage/account/keys#list). The storage account keys for the named `mystorageaccount` are listed in the following example:

    ```azurecli
    az storage account keys list --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --account-name mystorageaccount
    ```

    To extract a single key, use the `--query` flag. The following example extracts the first key (`[0]`):

    ```azurecli
    az storage account keys list --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --account-name mystorageaccount \
        --query '[0].{Key:value}' --output tsv
    ```

## Create a file share.

    The File storage share contains the SMB share with [az storage share create](/cli/azure/storage/share#create). The quota is always expressed in gigabytes (GB). Pass in one of the keys from the preceding `az storage account keys list` command. Create a share named mystorageshare with a 10-GB quota by using the following example:

    ```azurecli
    az storage share create --name mystorageshare \
        --quota 10 \
        --account-name mystorageaccount \
        --account-key nPOgPR<--snip-->4Q==
    ```

## Create directory


## Upload a file

To upload a file,  use [az storage file upload](/cli/azure/storage/file#az_storage_file_upload).

To upload a batch of files, use [az storage file upload-batch](/cli/azure/storage/file#az_storage_file_upload-batch)

## List files

[az storage file list](/cli/azure/storage/file#az_storage_file_list).


## Copy files

{az storage file copy}(/cli/azure/storage/file/copy)
