# How to create an Azure premium file storage account

Premium files is a new storage account type which contains only files objects and allows you to create premium file shares. It is meant to support enterprise applications, such as databases, CRM, and web content, as well as performance sensitive services, such as media/analytics, shared cache, highly variable or batch workloads, and content repositories.

This article shows you how to create this new account type using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Prerequisites

To access Azure Storage, you'll need an Azure subscription. If you don't already have a subscription, then create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Log in to Azure

Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Create a storage account

Now that you're in the Azure portal, you are ready to create your storage account.

Every storage account must belong to an Azure resource group. A resource group is a logical container for grouping your Azure services. When you create a storage account, you have the option to either create a new resource group, or use an existing resource group. This article shows how to create a new resource group.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Storage Accounts** on the left menu.

1. On the **Storage Accounts** window that appears, choose **Add**.
1. Select the subscription in which to create the storage account.
1. Under the **Resource group** field, select **Create new**. Enter a name for your new resource group, as shown in the following image.

1. Next, enter a name for your storage account. The name you choose must be unique across Azure. The name also must be between 3 and 24 characters in length, and can include numbers and lowercase letters only.
1. Select a location for your storage account, or use the default location.
1. For **Performance** select **Premium**.
1. Select **Account kind** and choose **FileStorage (preview)**.
1. Leave **Replication** set to its default value of **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**.

Once your storage account resource has been created, navigate to it.

## Create a premium file share

1. In the left menu for the storage account, scroll to the **File service** section, then select **Files (preview)**.
1. Select **+File share** to create a premium file share.
1. Enter a name and a desired quota for your file share, then select **Create**.
