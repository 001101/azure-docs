# How to create an NFS share

## Prerequisites

You must have already created a virtual machine and a virtual network.

- Create a [FileStorage account](storage-how-to-create-premium-fileshare.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since encryption-in-transit is not currently available with NFS shares, we recommend disabling your storage account's public endpoint and configuring private endpoints, to ensure your data is secure and only accessible via your network.

- Either [create a private endpoint](storage-files-networking-endpoints.md#create-a-private-endpoint) (recommended) or [restrict access to your public endpoint](storage-files-networking-endpoints.md#restrict-public-endpoint-access).

## Create an NFS share

Now that you have created a FileStorage account and configured the networking, you can create an NFS file share. The process is similar to creating an SMB share, you select **NFS** instead of **SMB** when creating the share.

1. Create a file share, when creating a file share select the **NFS** protocol.
1. For **Root Squash** make a selection.
1. Once the file share is created, select the share and select **+ Connect**.
1. Enter the mount path you'd like to use, then copy the script.
1. Remote into your VM and use the provided mounting script.

You have now mounted your NFS share
