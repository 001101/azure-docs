#Azure Files Share Snapshot Overview

Azure Storage provides the capability to take snapshots of file share. Snapshots
capture the share state at that point in time. In this article, we will describe
what are the capabilities share snapshots provide and how one can leverage them in their custom use cases.


## Use-Cases - When should I use snapshot?

### Protection against application error - Protection against data corruption
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application using Azure file share perform various operations such as writing, reading, storage, transmission, or processing. If the application gets misconfigured
or an unintentional bug is introduced which causes accidental overwrite or
damage to a few blocks. You can take a snapshot before deploying new application code and in case of a bug or application error is introduced with new deployment, you can go back to a
previous version of the data. 

### Protection against human error - Protection against accidental deletions or unintended changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine a user is working on a text file residing in a file share. Once the text file is closed, we lose
the ability to undo our changes. So in the event we need to recover a previous
version of the file, simply right-click on the file and select the Restore
Previous Versions menu option. In the event of a file was accidentally renamed or deleted,
you have to view the previous version of the containing folder.

### For creating regular backup
---------------------------

After creating an Azure File share, you can periodically create a snapshot of
the file share to use it for data backup. Fileshare snapshot when taken periodically, helps maintain previous versions of data in a file share that can be used to retrieve data in case of audit requirement or disaster revoery.

## Snapshot Capabilities

Snapshot is a point in time read-only copy of your data. One can create, delete snapshots using REST API. Same capabilities are also available in Client Library, CLI and Azure portal. Powershell integration for snapshot is also coming soon. One can view snapshots of a share, file or directory using both REST API and SMB. SMB experience is similar to that of VSS, where customers can retrieve the list of versions of directory or file, and they can also mount a specific version directly as a drive. Once a snapshot has been created, it can be read, copied, or deleted, but not modified. Note that you can't copy a whole snapshot to another storage account, you have to do that file by file using azcopy or other copying mechanisms.

Snapshot capability is provided at the file share level, while
retrieval is provided it at the file level to allow for restoring individual
files. To restore a file share fully, customers will either query each file in a
snapshot and restore one file at a time using REST API, portal or Client
Library; or will use PowerShell/CLI tooling to restore a complete share.

A snapshot of a file share is identical to its base file share, except that the
share URI has a \*\*DateTime\*\* value appended to the share URI to indicate the
time at which the snapshot was taken. For example, if a file share URI is
\`http://storagesample.core.file.windows.net/myshare \`, the snapshot URI is
similar to \`
```
http://storagesample.core.file.windows.net/myshare?snapshot=2011-03-09T01:42:34.9360000Z.
```

Snapshots persist until they are explicitly deleted. A snapshot cannot outlive
its base file share. You can enumerate the snapshots associated with the base
file share to track your current snapshots. When you create a snapshot of a file
share, the files residing in share’s system properties are copied to the
snapshot with the same values. The base files in file share’s metadata is also
copied to the snapshot, unless you specify separate metadata for the snapshot
when you create it.

You cannot delete a share that has snapshots. You have to delete all the snapshots first.


## Snapshot space usage 

Snapshots are incremental in nature, which means that only the data that have
changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. This minimizes the time
required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs. Any write operation to the object or property or metadata update operation is counted towards churn and will be stored in the snapshot. 

In order to conserve space, one can delete the snapshot during which period the churn was highest.

Even though snapshots are saved incrementally, the snapshot deletion process is
designed so that you need to retain only the most recent snapshot in order to
restore the share. When you delete a snapshot, only the data unique to that
snapshot is removed. Active snapshots contain all of the information needed to
browse and restore your data (from the time the snapshot was taken) to original
or alternate location. The restore can be done at item-level.

Snapshots are NOT counted towards your 5 TB share Limit. There is no limit to
how much space in total is occupied by snapshot. The amount of storage
space occupied by snapshots is independent of the total limit for your storage
account. 

## Limits

There is a limit of 200 snapshots that Azure Files can retain. After 200
snapshots, older snapshots will have to be deleted in order to create new
snapshots. There is no limit to the simultaneous calls for create snapshot.
There is no limit to amount of space snapshots of a particular file share can
consume. 

## Copy data back to share from Snapshot

Copy operations involving files and snapshots follow these rules:

You can copy an individual files in a file share snapshot over its base share or
any other location.You can restore an earlier version of a file or complete file share by copying file by file from snapshot. The
snapshot remains, but the base file share is overwritten with a the copy of data that was available in the snapshot. All the restored file will count towards churn for next snapshot.

You can copy a file in a snapshot to a destination with a different name. The
resulting destination file is a writable file and not a snapshot.

When a destination file is overwritten with a copy, any
snapshots associated with the original destination file remain intact.

## General Best Practices 

When running infrastructure on the Azure, automate backups for data recovery
whenever possible. Automated actions are more reliable than manual processes,
helping to improve data protection and recoverability. 

Carefully consider your snapshot frequency and retention settings before
deploying the Snapshot Scheduler to avoid incurring unnecessary snapshot
charges.

Snapshots provides only file level protection and any fat finger deletes on file share or storage account are not protected by snapshots . It is a best practice to lock storage account or resource group in order to protect the storage account from accidental deletions.

Consider using Azure Backup which is in Limited public preview at this time to automate the scheduling retention and management of your periodic backups.
