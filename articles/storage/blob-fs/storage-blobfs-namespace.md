# Azure Data Lake Storage Hierarchical Namespace Service

A key mechanism that allows ADLS to provide filesystem performance at object storage scale and prices is the introduction of the **Hierarchical Namespace Service (HNS)**. The HNS allows the collection of blobs within an account to be organized into a hierarchy of directories and nested sub-directories in the same way that the filesystem on your computer is organized. With the HNS enabled, Azure Data Lake Storage provides the scalability, cost-effectiveness and availability that you expect from a cloud storage service, but with an access model that is familiar to all users of a computer - and more importantly, familiar to all of the analytics engines and frameworks that are designed to expect filesystem semantics.

# What are the benefits of the Hierarchical Namespace Service

There are many benefits for exposing a performant filesystem interface, powered by the HNS, over blob data:

- **Atomic Directory Manipulation** - most object stores approximate a directory hierarchy by adopting a convention of embedding slashes (/) in the name of the object to denote a path segment. While this convention works satisfactorilly for organizing objects, when you need to do things like move/rename or delete a directory this convention provides no assistance at all and applications must process potentially millions of individual operations to achieve these simple procedures. The HNS, on the other hand, can process these tasks by updating a single entry (the parent directory). This drammatic optimization is especially significant for many big data analytics frameworks (eg. Hive, Spark, etc.) as they write output to temporary locations and then rename the location at the conclusion of the job. Without the HNS, this rename can often take longer than the analytics process itself. Lower job latency equals lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for analytics workloads.

- **POSIX-Compliant Object-Level Access Control Lists (ACLs)** - enabling the HNS on your account provides a platform to implement [POSIX-compliant ACLs](./storage-blobfs-security-guide.md). ACLs rely on the ability to set default permissions on parent directories and any files created within that directory will 'inherit' those permissions. This is only possible with a strong hierarchical structure. Many applications, including almost all well-known analytics frameworks, are designed to support POSIX-compliant ACLs so that shared storage spaces may be partitioned and secured appropriately as per the enterprise's requirements.

- **Familiar Interface Style** - filesystems are well-understood by developers and users alike. There is no need to learn a new storage paradigm when you move to the cloud as the filesystem interface exposed by ADLS is the same paradigm used by computers, large and small.

One of the reasons that object stores have not historically supported hierarchical namespaces is that it limited scale. However, the ADLS HNS scales linearly and does not degrade either scale or performance.

# When should you enable the Hierarchical Namespace

Turning HNS on is recommended for storage workloads that are designed for filesystems and will perform manipulation of directories. This includes all workloads that are primarily for analytics processing. Also, datasets that require a high degree of organization will also benefit by enabling HNS.

Additionally, if you require fine-grained access control of files contained within a shared account you must enable HNS to gain this ability.

The reason for enabling HNS is determined by a TCO analysis. Generally speaking, improvements in workload latency due to storage acceleration will require compute resources for less time. Latency for many workloads may be improved due to atomic directory manipulation that is enabled by HNS. In many workloads, the compute resource represents > 85% of the total cost and so even a modest reduction in workload latency will equate to a significant amount of TCO savings. Even in cases where enabling HNS increases storage costs, the TCO is still lowered due to reduced compute costs.

# When should you disable the Hierarchical Namespace

There are a number of 'classic' object store workloads that will most likely not gain any benefit by enabling HNS. Examples of these workloads are; backups, image storage and other applications where object organization is stored separately to the objects themselves (eg. in a separate database).

Note, however, that ADLS still makes this data available for big data analytics by being fully interoperable with the Azure Storage Blobs interface.
