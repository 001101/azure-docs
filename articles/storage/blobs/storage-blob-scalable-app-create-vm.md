# Create a virtual machine and storage account for a scalable application

This tutorial is part one of a series. This tutorial shows you deploy an application that uploads large amount of random data and download data with an Azure storage account. When you're finished, you have a console application running on a virtual machine that you upload and download large amounts of data to a storage account.

In part one of the series, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a storage account
> * Create a virtual machine
> * Configure a custom script extension

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create resource group

Create an Azure resource group with [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup). A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location EastUS

## Create a storage account
 
The sample uploads large files to a blob container in an Azure Storage account. A storage account provides a unique namespace to store and access your Azure storage data objects. Create a storage account in the resource group you created by using the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#create) command.

In the following command, substitute your own globally unique name for the Blob storage account where you see the `<blob_storage_account>` placeholder.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account create --name gw123gw432 \
--location eastus --resource-group myResourceGroup7 \
--sku Standard_LRS --kind blobstorage --access-tier hot
```

## Create a storage account

Create a standard general-purpose storage account with LRS replication using [New-AzureRmStorageAccount](/powershell/module/azurerm.storage/New-AzureRmStorageAccount), then retrieve the storage account context that defines the storage account to be used. When acting on a storage account, you reference the context instead of repeatedly providing the credentials. This example creates a storage account called *mystorageaccount* with locally redundant storage and blob encryption enabled.

```powershell
$storageAccount = New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -Name "mystorageaccount" `
  -Location $location `
  -SkuName Standard_LRS `
  -Kind Storage `
  -EnableEncryptionService Blob

$ctx = $storageAccount.Context
```

## Create networking resources

### Create a virtual network, subnet, and a public IP address
These resources are used to provide network connectivity to the virtual machine and connect it to the internet.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create a subnet configuration
$subnetConfig = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name mySubnet -AddressPrefix 192.168.1.0/24

# Create a virtual network
$vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location EastUS `
    -Name MYvNET -AddressPrefix 192.168.0.0/16 -Subnet $subnetConfig

# Create a public IP address and specify a DNS name
$pip = New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location EastUS `
    -AllocationMethod Static -IdleTimeoutInMinutes 4 -Name "mypublicdns$(Get-Random)"
```

### Create a network card for the virtual machine. 
Create a network card with [New-AzureRmNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/new-azurermnetworkinterface) for the virtual machine. The network card connects the virtual machine to a subnet, network security group, and public IP address.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create a virtual network card and associate with public IP address and NSG
$nic = New-AzureRmNetworkInterface -Name myNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location EastUS `
    -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id -NetworkSecurityGroupId $nsg.Id
```

## Create virtual machine

Create a virtual machine configuration. This configuration includes the settings that are used when deploying the virtual machine such as a virtual machine image, size, and authentication configuration. When running this step, you are prompted for credentials. The values that you enter are configured as the user name and password for the virtual machine.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Define a credential object
$cred = Get-Credential

# Create a virtual machine configuration
$vmConfig = New-AzureRmVMConfig -VMName myVM -VMSize Standard_DS14_v2 | `
    Set-AzureRmVMOperatingSystem -Windows -ComputerName myVM -Credential $cred | `
    Set-AzureRmVMSourceImage -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer -Offer WindowsServer `
    -Skus 2016-Datacenter -Version latest | Add-AzureRmVMNetworkInterface -Id $nic.Id
```

Create the virtual machine with [New-AzureRmVM](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/new-azurermvm).

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location EastUS -VM $vmConfig
```

## Deploy configuration

For this tutorial there are pre-requisites that must be installed on the virtual machine.  The custom script extension is used to run a simple PowerShell script that does the following:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Install .NET core 2.0
> * Install chocolatey
> * Install GIT
> * Clone the sample repo
> * Restore Nuget packages
> * Creates 32 1GB files with random data

Run the following cmdlet to finalize configuration of the virtual machine. This step will take 5-10 minutes to complete.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Start a CustomScript extension to use a simple PowerShell script to instal .NET core, dependancies, and pre-create the files to upload.
Set-AzureRMVMCustomScriptExtension -ResourceGroupName $resourcegroup `
    -VMName myVM `
    -Location $location `
    -FileUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgewallace/StoragePerfandScalabilityExample/master/script.ps1 `
    -Run 'script.ps1' `
    -Name DemoScriptExtension
```

## Next steps

In part one of the series, you learned about creating a storage account, deploying a virtual machine and configuring the virtual machine with the required pre-requisites such as how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a storage account
> * Create a virtual machine
> * Configure a custom script extension

Advance to part two of the series to upload large amounts of data to a storage account using exponential retry and parallelism.
