# Mount Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 on Linux by using the Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol (preview)

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 supports the Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol. This support enables you to mount a container in Azure Data Lake Storage from a Linux-based Azure Virtual Machine (VM) or from a computer that runs Linux on on-premises. 

> [!NOTE]
> NFS 3.0 protocol support is in public preview.
>
> Support is available for general-purpose v2 accounts in the following regions: US Central (EUAP), and US East 2 (EUAP) regions. 
>
> Support is available for BlockBlobStorage accounts in the following regions: US East, US Central, US West Central, UK West, Korea South, Korea Central, EU North, Canada Central, and Australia Southeast.

## Register NFS 3.0 protocol feature with your subscription

To get started, use PowerShell commands to register the `AllowNFSV3` feature with your subscription.

1. Open a PowerShell command window. 

2. Sign in to your Azure subscription with the `Connect-AzAccount` command and follow the on-screen directions.

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

3. If your identity is associated with more than one subscription, then set your active subscription.

   ```powershell
   $context = Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId <subscription-id>
   Set-AzContext $context
   ```
   
   Replace the `<subscription-id>` placeholder value with the ID of your subscription.

4. Register the `AllowNFSV3` feature by using the following command.

   ```powershell
   Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowNFSV3 -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage 
   ```

5. If you plan to access a BlockBlobStorage account by using NFS 3.0 protocol, then register the `PremiumHns` feature by using the following command as well.

   ```powershell
   Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName PremiumHns -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage  
   ```

6. Register the resource provider by using the following command.
    
   ```powershell
   Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName PremiumHns -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage  
   ```

## Verify that the feature is registered 

After you register the NFS 3.0 protocol feature with your subscription, the registration must be approved. This can take up to an hour. 

To verify that the feature is registered with your subscription, use the following commands.

```powershell
Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage -FeatureName AllowNFSV3
Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage -FeatureName PremiumHns  
```

## Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

Your storage account must be contained within a VNet. To learn more about VNet and how to create one, see the [Virtual Network documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/).

If you plan to connect to your storage account by using a Virtual Machine (VM) that is in the same VNet as your storage account, 

If you plan to connect to your Azure storage account from an on-premises computer, you'll have to connect your on-premises network to your virtual network. See supported topologies.


## Configure a storage account

You can use the NFS 3.0 protocol only with new storage accounts. You can't enable existing accounts.

NFS 3.0 protocol is supported in the following types of storage accounts:

- [general-purpose V2](../common/storage-account-create.md)
- [BlockBlobStorage](../blobs/storage-blob-create-account-block-blob.md)

For information about how to choose between them, see [storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md).

As you configure the account, choose these values:

|Setting |general-purpose v2 account |BlockBlobStorage account|
|----|---|----|
|Location|US Central (EUAP), US East 2 (EUAP)|US East, US Central, US West Central, UK West, Korea South, Korea Central, EU North, Canada Central, and Australia Southeast |
|Performance|Standard|Premium|
|Account kind|StorageV2 (general purpose vs2|BlockBlobStorage|
|Replication|Locally-redundant storage (LRS)|Locally-redundant storage (LRS)|
|Connectivity method|Public endpoint (selected networks) or Private endpoint.|Public endpoint (selected networks) or Private endpoint.|
|Secure transfer required|Disabled|Disabled|
|Hierarchical namespace|Enabled|Enabled|
|NFS V3|Enabled|Enabled|

You can accept the default value for all other settings. 

## Create and mount a container

In the current release, you can mount only containers. You can't mount individual directories that are inside of a container.

You can create a container by using [Azure Storage Explorer](data-lake-storage-explorer.md#create-a-container), [AzCopy](../common/storage-use-azcopy-blobs.md#create-a-container), [PowerShell](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-powershell.md#create-a-container), [Azure CLI](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-cli.md#create-a-container), [.NET](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-dotnet.md#create-a-container), [Java](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-java.md#create-a-container), [Python](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-python.md#create-a-container), [JavaScript](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-javascript.md#create-a-container), or [REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/create-container).

On a computer running Linux, you can mount a container by using the following command.

```
mount -o sec=sys,vers=3,nolock,proto=tcp <storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net:<storage-account-name>/<container-name>  /mnt/test
```

Replace the `<storage-account-name>` placeholder that appears in this command with the name of your storage account.  

Replace the `<container-name>` placeholder with the name of your container.
