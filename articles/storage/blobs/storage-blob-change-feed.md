# Change feed support in Azure Blob Storage

Change feed logs record all changes that occur to the blobs and the blob metadata in your storage account. These logs are stored as blobs in your account and the cost to store them is standard [blob pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/). These blobs are durable, immutable, and read-only. 

Process change feed logs at your convenience. You can use them to audit or analyze changes over any period of time.  Your applications can take action on objects that have changed. For example, synchronize data with a cache, update a search engine or data warehouse, or perform other derivative batch or analytic processing. Because change feed logs are stored as blobs, analytic applications can consume them directly. Use analytic applications to efficiently process logs in batch-mode, at low cost, and without having to write a custom application.  

> [!NOTE]
> The change feed is in public preview, and is available in the westcentralus and westus2 regions. To review limitations, see the [Known issues and limitations](#known-issues) section of this article. To enroll in the preview, see [this page](storage-blob-change-feed.md).

## Change feed versus events

Unlike *Blob Storage events*, which enable your applications to react to changes in real-time, change feed logs provide an ordered log of records called *change event records*. Changes are appended to the change feed every 60 - 120 seconds. You applications can read the change feed by periodically polling for newer changes based on this frequency. 

If your application has to react to events much quicker than this, consider using blob storage events instead. See [Reacting to Blob storage events](storage-blob-event-overview.md)

## Enabling and disabling the change feed

You have to enable the change feed to begin capturing change logs. Disable the change feed to stop capturing changes. You can enable and disable changes by using the Azure portal. 

Show screenshot here.

Here's a few things to keep in mind when you enable the change feed.

- You can't exclude event types. If you enable the change feed, you'll capture all supported events. 

  In the current public preview, that list includes the create, update, delete and copy operations.

- Changes are captured only as they relate to blobs and blob metadata in the storage account, and not at the resource group level.

- The storage account has only one change feed. 

## Understanding the Change feed files

The change feed creates several files, and you can find them in the **$blobchangefeed** container. This table describes each file and how to use it.

| File    | Blob virtual directory | Purpose    |
|--------|-----------|---|
| Segment files | `$blobchangefeed/idx/segments/` | A *segment* represents 60 minutes worth of change events. A segment file contains a path to the associated change feed logs for that segment. The `$blobchangefeed/idx/segments/` virtual directory contains a list (or *index*) of these files. You can use that list to filter out the logs of interest to you. <br><br>To learn more, see the [Segment files](#segment-index) section of this article.|
| Log files | `$blobchangefeed/log/`|A log file contains a series of change event records. These records are listed in the order in which they occurred. These records use the [Apache Avro 1.8.2](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/spec.html) format. <br><br>To learn more, see the [Log files](#log-files) section of this article.|
| Segments.json | `$blobchangefeed/meta/`|There is only one of these files. You can use it to determine the last consumable log file. <br><br>To learn more, see the [Segments.json](#segment-json) section of this article.|

In your client applications, start by reading the segments.json file to determine the last consumable segment. Then, read the segment file for each segment of interest based on your custom check pointing and filtering logic. 

Each segment file contains a path to log files related to that segment. Read each log file and iterate through all the change event records. 

You can read files by using an SDK (For example: .NET, Java, or Python), or just use GetBlob and ListBlob REST calls. Your application must use it's own filtering logic with the change feed. Also, your application will have to manage it's own check pointing logic, but since the change feed is an immutable, append-only log, your check points will be stable.

There are several libraries available to process files that use the [Apache Avro 1.8.2](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/spec.html) format.
To see an example of processing change feed logs by using the [Apache.Avro](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Avro/) NuGet Package for .NET client applications, see [Process change feed logs in Azure Blob Storage](storage-blob-change-feed-how-to.md).

### Segment files

Segment files use the json file format, and have a suffix of `meta.json`. To view all segments, list the contents of the `$blobchangefeed/idx/segments/` virtual directory. Here's an example listing of that directory.

```text
Name                                                                    Blob Type    Blob Tier      Length  Content Type    
----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------  -----------  --------  ----------------
$blobchangefeed/idx/segments/1601/01/01/0000/meta.json                  BlockBlob                      584  application/json
$blobchangefeed/idx/segments/2019/02/22/1810/meta.json                  BlockBlob                      584  application/json
$blobchangefeed/idx/segments/2019/02/22/1910/meta.json                  BlockBlob                      584  application/json
$blobchangefeed/idx/segments/2019/02/23/0110/meta.json                  BlockBlob                      584  application/json
```

Each segment file contains meta data that describes that segment. 

Here's an example of a segment file.

```json
{
    "version": 0,
    "begin": "2019-02-22T18:10:00.000Z",
    "intervalSecs": 3600,
    "status": "Finalized",
    "config": {
        "version": 0,
        "configVersionEtag": "0x8d698f0fba563db",
        "numShards": 2,
        "recordsFormat": "avro",
        "formatSchemaVersion": 1,
        "shardDistFnVersion": 1
    },
    "chunkFilePaths": [
        "$blobchangefeed/log/00/2019/02/22/1810/",
        "$blobchangefeed/log/01/2019/02/22/1810/"
    ],
    "storageDiagnostics": {
        "version": 0,
        "lastModifiedTime": "2019-02-22T18:11:01.187Z",
        "data": {
            "aid": "55e507bf-8006-0000-00d9-ca346706b70c"
        }
    }
}

```

You can ignore values in the `storageDiagnonstics` property bag. That property bag is for internal use only and not designed for use by your application. In fact, the only property that your application needs to use is the `chunkFilePaths` property. That property contains the path to log files that are associated with the segment.

### Log files

Log files are stored in the `$blobchangefeed/log/` virtual directory. Change feed log files are stored as [append blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-append-blobs). Changes are batched and appended to log files every 60 to 120 seconds. Those changes appear as change records and they appear in the order in which the event occurred. 

Change event records use the [Apache Avro 1.8.2](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/spec.html) format so the log file has the *.avro* file extension. The first log file under each path will have `00000` in the file name (For example `00000.avro`). The name of each subsequent log file added to that path will increment by 1 (For example: `00001.avro`. 

Here's an example of a log file.

```json
{
     "schemaVersion": 1,
     "topic": "/subscriptions/dd40261b-437d-43d0-86cf-ef222b78fd15/resourceGroups/sadodd/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/SADODD-DEV-09",
     "subject": "/blobServices/default/containers/apitestcontainerver/blobs/F_0003",
     "eventType": "BlobCreated",
     "eventTime": "2019-02-22T18:12:01.079Z",
     "id": "55e5531f-8006-0000-00da-ca3467000000",
     "data": {
         "api": "PutBlob",
         "clientRequestId": "edf598f4-e501-4750-a3ba-9752bb22df39",
         "requestId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
         "etag": "0x8D698F13DCB47F6",
         "contentType": "application/octet-stream",
         "contentLength": 128,
         "blobType": "BlockBlob",
         "url": "",
         "sequencer": "000000000000000100000000000000060000000000006d8a",
         "storageDiagnostics": {
             "bid": "11cda41c-13d8-49c9-b7b6-bc55c41b3e75",
             "seq": "(6,5614,28042,28038)",
             "sid": "591651bd-8eb3-c864-1001-fcd187be3efd"
         }
  }
}

```
For a description of each property, see [Azure Event Grid event schema for Blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/event-schema-blob-storage?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#event-properties).

You can ignore records where the `eventType` has a value of `Control`. These are internal system records and don't reflect a change to objects in your account. You can also ignore values in the `storageDiagnonstics` property bag. That property bag is for internal use only and not designed for use by your application.

<a id="segments-json" />

### Segments.json file

This file appears in the `$blobchangefeed/meta/` virtual directory. Use this file to determine the last segment that your application can safely consume. That date is recorded in the `LastConsumable` property of the segments.json file. Segments that appear in the `$blobchangefeed/idx/segments/` virtual directory that are dated after the date of the `LastConsumable`property, are not finalized and should not be consumed by your application.  

Here's an example segments.json file.

```json
{
    "version": 0,
    "lastConsumable": "2019-02-23T01:10:00.000Z",
    "storageDiagnostics": {
        "version": 0,
        "lastModifiedTime": "2019-02-23T02:24:00.556Z",
        "data": {
            "aid": "55e551e3-8006-0000-00da-ca346706bfe4",
            "lfz": "2019-02-22T19:10:00.000Z"
        }
    }
}

```

You can also ignore values in the `storageDiagnonstics` property bag. That property bag is for internal use only and not designed for use by your application.

## Known issues and limitations

This section describes known issues and limitations in the current public preview of the change feed.

- The change feed captures only create, update, delete, and copy operations.
- You can't yet manage the lifetime of change feed log files by setting time-based retention policy on them.
- The `url` property of the log file is always empty.
- The `LastConsumable` property of the segments.json file does not list the very first segment that the change feed finalizes. This issue occurs only after the first segment is finalized. All subsequent segments are accurately captured in the `LastConsumable` property. 
- If you list the containers in your storage account, the **$blobchangefeed** container appears only after you've enabled the change feed feature on your account. You'll have to wait a few minutes after you enable the change feed before you can see the container.
- Log files don't immediately appear after a segment is created. The length of delay is within the normal interval of the change feed (60 to 120 seconds).
