# Use Azure Storage inventory to manage blob data (preview)

Azure Blob Storage inventory is a tool to help get an overview of your blob data within a storage account. Use the inventory report to understand your total data size, age, encryption status, and so on. The inventory report provides an overview of your data for business and compliance requirements. Once enabled, an inventory report is created automatically daily.

## Availability

Blob inventory is supported for general purpose version 2 (GPv2), premium block blob storage, and Azure DataLake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) accounts.

## Enable inventory reports

Enable blob inventory reports by adding a policy to your storage account. Add, edit, or remove a policy by using any of the following methods:

- [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) 
- [REST APIs](/rest/api/storagerp/managementpolicies)

Inventory policies are read or written in full. Partial updates are not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> If you enable firewall rules for your storage account, inventory requests may be blocked. You can unblock these requests by providing exceptions for trusted Microsoft services. > For more information, see the Exceptions section in [Configure firewalls and virtual networks](../common/storage-network-security.md#exceptions).

### Blob inventory frequency

A blob inventory policy is automatically scheduled every day and can take up to 24 hours to complete.

### Blob inventory policies and rules

An inventory in an account is configured by adding an inventory policy with one or more rules.

## Inventory policy

An inventory policy is a collection of rules in a JSON document.

```json
{
    "destination": "destinationContainer",
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": [
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "name": "inventoryrule1",
        "definition": {...}
    },
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "name": "inventoryrule2",
        "definition": {...}
    }]
}
```

## Inventory rules

A rule captures the filtering conditions and output parameters for inventory generation. Each rule leads to an independent inventory. Different rules can have the same or overlapping prefixes between them. A blob can appear in more than one inventory depending on rule definitions.


| Parameter name | Parameter type        | Notes | Required? |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------|-----------|
| destination    | String                | The destination container where all inventory files will be generated. The destination container must already exist when inventory is configured. | Yes |
| enabled        | Boolean               | Used to disable the entire policy. When this is set to true, the rule level enabled field will override this. When disabled, inventory for all rules will be disabled. | Yes |
| rules          | Array of rule objects | At least one rule is required in a policy. Up to 10 rules are supported in the preview. | Yes |

Each rule within the policy has several parameters:

| Parameter name | Parameter type                 | Notes | Required? |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------|-----------|
| name           | String                         | A rule name can include up to 256 alphanumeric characters. Rule name is case-sensitive. It must be unique within a policy. | Yes |
| enabled        | Boolean                        | An optional boolean to allow a rule to be temporarily disabled. Default value is true if it's not set. | Yes |
| definition     | JSON inventory rule definition | Each definition is made up of a rule filter set. | Yes |

## Rule filters

| Filter name         | Filter type                        | Notes | Required? |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------|-----------|
| blobTypes           | An array of predefined enum values | Valid values are blockBlob and appendBlob for hierarchical namespace enabled accounts, and blockBlob, appendBlob and pageBlob for other accounts. | Yes |
| prefixMatch         | An array of up to 10 strings for prefixes to be matched. A prefix string must start with a container name. For example, `container1/foo` | If you don't define prefixMatch or provide an empty prefix, the rule applies to all blobs within the storage account. | No |
| includeSnapshots    | Boolean                            | Specifies whether Inventory should include snapshots or not. Default is false. | No |
| includeBlobVersions | Boolean                            | Specifies whether Inventory should include blob versions or not. Default is false. | No |

```json
{
    "rules": [
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "name": "inventoryrule1",
        "definition":
        {
            "filters":
            {
                "blobTypes": ["blockBlob", "appendBlob", "pageBlob"],
                "prefixMatch": ["inventorycontainer1", "inventorycontainer2/abcd", "etc"]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "name": "inventoryrule2",
        "definition":
        {
            "filters":
            {
                "blobTypes": ["pageBlob"],
                "prefixMatch": ["inventorycontainer-disks-", "inventorycontainer4/"],
                "includeSnapshots": true,
                "includeBlobVersions": true
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

## Inventory output

Each inventory run generates a set of CSV formatted files in the destination container specified by the user. The inventory output is generated under the following path:
https://\<*accountName*\>.blob.core.windows.net/\<*inventory-destination-container*\>/YYYY/MM/DD/HH-MM-SS/
where:

- *accountName* is your account name
- *inventory-destination-container* is the destination container you specified in the inventory policy
- *YYYY/MM/DD/HH-MM-SS* is the time when the inventory began to run
