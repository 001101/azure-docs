# What is Azure Blob storage? 

Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for securely storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text and binary data, at scale. Objects in Blob storage are available via HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere in the world. For more information about Blob storage, see [Introduction to object storage in Azure](storage-blobs-introduction.md).

Blob storage supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Microsoft's big data analytics solution for the cloud. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 offers a hierarchical file system as well as the advantages of Blob storage, including low-cost, tiered storage; high availability; strong consistency; and disaster recovery capabilities. For more information about Data Lake Storage Gen2, see [Introduction to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Preview](../data-lake-storage/introduction.md).
