# Manage directories, files, and ACLs in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Python)

This article shows you how to use Python to work with directories, files, and POSIX [access control lists](data-lake-storage-access-control.md) (ACLs) in storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace.

## Connect to the storage account

To use the snippets in this article, you'll need to create a [BlockBlobService](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blockblobservice.blockblobservice?view=azure-python) instance that represents the storage account. The easiest way to get one is to use an account key. 

This example uses an account key to create a [BlockBlobService](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blockblobservice.blockblobservice?view=azure-python) instance that represents Blob storage in your storage account. 

```python
def initialize_storage_account(storage_account_name, storage_account_key):
    try:
       global block_blob_service

       block_blob_service = BlockBlobService(account_name=storage_account_name, account_key=storage_account_key)

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```
 
- Replace the `storage_account_name` placeholder value with the name of your storage account.

- Replace the `storage-account-key` placeholder value with your storage account access key.

## Create a directory

Add a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.create_directory** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path of the new directory.

This example adds a directory named `my-directory` to a container. 

```python
def create_directory(container_name):
    try:

        block_blob_service.create_directory(container_name, "my-directory")

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

## Rename a directory

Rename a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.rename_path** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path that you want to give the directory.
- The path of the existing directory.

This example renames the directory `my-directory` to the name `my-new-directory`.

```python
def rename_directory(container_name):
  
    try:

        block_blob_service.rename_path(container_name,"my-new-directory","my-directory")

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)) 
```

## Move a directory

Move a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.rename_path** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path that you want to give the directory.
- The path of the existing directory.


This example moves a directory named `my-directory` to a sub-directory of another directory named `my-directory-2`. 

```python
def rename_directory(container_name):
  
    try:

        block_blob_service.rename_path(container_name, "my-directory", "my-directory-2/my-directory") )

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)) 

```

## Delete a directory

Delete a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.delete_directory** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path of the directory that you want to delete.

This method deletes a directory named `my-directory`.  

```python
def delete_directory(container_name):
  
    try:

        block_blob_service.delete_directory(container_name, "my-directory")

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

## Get the ACL of a directory

Get the access permissions of a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.get_path_access_control** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path of the directory.

This example gets the ACL of a directory named `my-directory`, and then prints the short form of ACL to the console.

```python
def get_directory_permissions(container_name):
  
    try:

        path_properties = PathProperties()
        path_properties = block_blob_service.get_path_access_control(container_name, "my-directory")
        
        print(path_properties.acl)

        print("Acl: {}".format(path_properties.acl))

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

The short form of an ACL might look something like the following:

`user::rwx,group::r-x,other::---`

This string means that the owning user has read, write, and execute permissions. The owning group has only read and execute permissions. 

## Set the ACL of a directory

Set the access permissions of a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.set_directory_permissions** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path of the directory.
- The short form of the desired ACL.

This example gives read access to all users.

```python
def set_directory_permissions(container_name):
  
    try:

        block_blob_service.set_path_access_control(container_name, "my-directory", acl='other::r--')
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

## Upload a file to a directory 

Upload a file to a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.create_blob_from_path** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path to the location in your container where you want to place this file along with the name of the file.
- The path to the local file that you want to upload.

This example uploads a file named `my-file.txt` to a directory named `my-directory`.

```python
def upload_file_to_directory(container_name, file_name):

        # Upload the created file, use local_file_name for the blob name
        block_blob_service.create_blob_from_path(container_name, "my-directory/my-file.txt", file_name)
```

## Get the ACL of a file

Get the access permissions of a file by calling the **BlockBlobService.get_path_access_control** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path of the file.

This example gets the ACL of a file named `my-file.txt`, and then prints the short form of ACL to the console.

```python
def get_file_ACL(container_name):
  
    try:

        path_properties = PathProperties()
        path_properties = block_blob_service.get_path_access_control(container_name, "my-directory/my-file.txt")

        print("Acl: {}".format(path_properties.acl))

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

## Set the ACL of a file

Set the access permissions of a file by calling the **BlockBlobService.set_directory_permissions** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path of the file.
- The short form of the desired ACL.

This example gives read access to all users.

```python
def set_file_ACL(container_name):
  
    try:

        block_blob_service.set_path_access_control(container_name, "my-directory/my-file.txt", acl='other::r--')
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

## Download a file from a directory 

Download a file from a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.get_blob_to_path** method. Pass these items as parameters to the method:

- The name of the container.
- The path to the file in your storage account. 
- The path to the local file system where you want to download this file along with the name that you want to give the downloaded file.

```python
def download_file_from_directory(container_name, file_destination_path):

    block_blob_service.get_blob_to_path(container_name, "my-directory/my-file.txt", file_destination_path)
```
## List the contents of a directory 

List the contents of a directory by calling the **BlockBlobService.list_blobs** method.

```python
def list_directory_contents():
    print("\nList blobs in the 'my-directory' directory")
    generator = block_blob_service.list_blobs("mycontainer/my-directory")
    for blob in generator:
        print("\t Blob name: " + blob.name)
```
