# Verify throughput and latency metrics for a storage account

This tutorial is part four and the final part of a series. In the previous tutorials you learned how to upload and download larges amounts of random data to an Azure storage account. This tutorial shows you how you can use metrics to view throughput and latency in the Azure portal.

In part four of the series, you learn how to:

> * Configure charts in the Azure portal
> * Verify throughput and latency metrics

[Azure storage metrics](../common/storage-metrics-in-azure-monitor.md) uses Azure monitor to provide a unified
