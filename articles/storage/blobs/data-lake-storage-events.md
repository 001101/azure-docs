If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* Create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.

  See [Create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account](data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account.md).

* Make sure that your user account has the [Storage Blob Data Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac) assigned to it.

* Install AzCopy v10. See [Transfer data with AzCopy v10](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json)

* Create a service principal. See [How to: Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

  There's a couple of specific things that you'll have to do as you perform the steps in that article.

  :heavy_check_mark: When performing the steps in the [Assign the application to a role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#assign-the-application-to-a-role) section of the article, make sure to assign the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role to the service principal.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Make sure to assign the role in the scope of the Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account. You can assign a role to the parent resource group or subscription, but you'll receive permissions-related errors until those role assignments propagate to the storage account.

  :heavy_check_mark: When performing the steps in the [Get values for signing in](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-values-for-signing-in) section of the article, paste the tenant ID, app ID, and password values into a text file. You'll need those soon.
