# Migrate Azure Data Lake Storage from Gen1 to Gen2

You can migrate your data, workloads, and applications from Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Data Lake Storage Gen2.

Data Lake Storage Gen2 is Microsoft's latest Data Lake Storage repository. It combines Gen1 features such as file system semantics, directory and file level security, and scale with low-cost, tiered storage, high availability/disaster recovery capabilities from Azure Blob Storage. 

To learn more, see [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/).

> [!NOTE]
> For easier reading, this article uses the term *Gen1* to refer to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, and the term *Gen2* to refer to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## Migration road map

To migrate to Gen2, we recommend the following path.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 1: Assess whether to migrate

:heavy_check_mark: Step 2: Prepare to migrate

:heavy_check_mark: Step 3: Migrate data

:heavy_check_mark: Step 4: Update workloads and applications

> [!NOTE]
> There's no way to convert a Gen1 account into Gen2 because these accounts run in separate services.

### Step 1: Assess whether to migrate

:one: &nbsp;&nbsp;Learn about the [Data Lake Storage Gen2 offering](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/); it's benefits, costs, and general architecture. 

:two: &nbsp;&nbsp;[Compare the capabilities](#gen1-gen2-feature-comparison) of Gen1 with those of Gen2. 

:three: &nbsp;&nbsp;Review a list of [known issues](data-lake-storage-known-issues.md) to gauge product state and stability and assess any gaps.

:four: &nbsp;&nbsp;If you're interested in leveraging blob storage features, review the [current level of support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-multi-protocol-access?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#blob-storage-feature-support) for those features.

:five: &nbsp;&nbsp;Review the current state of [Azure ecoysystem support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-multi-protocol-access?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#azure-ecosystem-support) to ensure that services that your solutions depend upon support  Gen2.

### Step 2: Prepare to migrate

:one: &nbsp;&nbsp;Identify the data sets that you'll migrate.

:two: &nbsp;&nbsp;Determine the impact that a migration will have on your business.

:three: &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a migration plan. We recommend any of these [migration patterns](#migration-patterns).

### Step 3: Migrate data

:one: &nbsp;&nbsp;[Create a storage account](data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account.md) and enable the hierarchical namespace feature. 

:two: &nbsp;&nbsp;Migrate data by using the data transfer tool that you've chosen.

:three: &nbsp;&nbsp;[Assign role-based access control (RBAC) roles](../common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal.md) to security principles. 

:four: &nbsp;&nbsp;Optionally [apply file and folder level security](data-lake-storage-access-control.md).

### Step 4: Update workloads and applications

:one: &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure [services in your workloads](data-lake-storage-integrate-with-azure-services.md) to point to your Gen2 endpoint. 

:two: &nbsp;&nbsp;Update applications to use Gen2 APIs. See guides for [.NET](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-dotnet.md), [Java](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-java.md), [Python](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-python.md), and [REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/data-lake-storage-gen2). 

:three: &nbsp;&nbsp;Update scripts to use Data Lake Storage Gen2 [PowerShell cmdlets](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-powershell.md), and [Azure CLI commands](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-cli.md).

:four: &nbsp;&nbsp;Search for URI references that contain the string `adl://` in code files, or in Databricks notebooks, Apache Hive HQL files or any other file used as part of your workloads. 

:five: &nbsp;&nbsp;Replace these references with the [Gen2 formatted URI](data-lake-storage-introduction-abfs-uri.md) of your new storage account. For example: the Gen1 URI: `adl://mydatalakestore.azuredatalakestore.net/mydirectory/myfile` might become `abfss://myfilesystem@mydatalakestore.dfs.core.windows.net/mydirectory/myfile`.
