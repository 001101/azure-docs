# Developer guide for Data Lake Storage

This guide points you to content that helps you develop applications that create and manage files (blobs), create and manage directories, and manage directory and file permissions.

Some of the content featured in these links use terms such as *blobs* and *containers* instead of *files* and *file systems*. That's because Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is built on blob storage, and in blob storage a *file* is represented as a *blob*, and a *file system* is represented as a *container*. 

Use this table as a guide to understanding terminology: Include Priya's awesome table (or something similar).
