# Use .NET with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

This guide shows you how to use .NET to interact with files (blobs), manage directories, and set directory-level access permissions (access-control lists) in storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace. 

To use the snippets presented in this article, you'll need to create a storage account, and then enable the hierarchical namespace feature on that account. See [Create a storage account](data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The snippets featured in this article use terms such as containers and blobs instead of the terms file system and files. At the object layer, these terms mean the same things. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is built on blob storage so files are blobs, and file systems are containers. 

## Set up your development environment

What you install depends on the operating system that you are running on your development computer.

### Windows

* Install [.NET Core for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) or the [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) (included with Visual Studio for Windows)

* Install [Visual Studio for Windows](https://www.visualstudio.com/). If you are using .NET Core, installing Visual Studio is optional. 

* Install the [Azure Storage APIs for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage?view=azure-dotnet).

### Linux

* Install [.NET Core for Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux)

* Optionally install [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp&dotnetid=963890049.1518206068)

* Install the [Azure Storage APIs for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage?view=azure-dotnet).

### macOS

* Install [.NET Core for macOS](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/macos).

* Optionally install [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)

* Install the [Azure Storage APIs for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage?view=azure-dotnet).

## Add library references to your code file

Add these using statements to your code file.

```cs
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;
```

## Perform common blob tasks 

You can use the same set of APIs to interact with your files (blobs) regardless of whether the account has a hierarchical namespace. To find snippets that help you perform common tasks such as creating a file system, uploading and downloading files, and deleting files and file systems, see [Quickstart: Use .NET to create a blob in object storage](storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet.md).

The rest of this article presents snippets that help you perform tasks related only to accounts that have a hierarchical namespace.
