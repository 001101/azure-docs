# Data transfer for large datasets with moderate to high network bandwidth
 
This article provides an overview of the data transfer solutions when you have moderate to high network bandwidth in your environment and you are planning to transfer large datasets. The article also describes the recommended data transfer options and the respective key capability matrix for this scenario.

To understand an overview of all the available data transfer options, go to [Choose an Azure data transfer solution](storage-choose-data-transfer-solution.md).

## Scenario description

Large datasets refer to data sizes in the order of TBs to PBs. Moderate to high network bandwidth refers to 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps.

## Recommended options

The options recommended in this scenario depend on whether you have moderate network bandwidth or high network bandwidth.

### Moderate network bandwidth (100 Mbps - 1 Gbps)

-	**Azure Data Box for offline transfers** – Choose from Data Box Disk, Data Box, Data Box Heavy, or Import/Export to do these offline bulk transfers when you have moderate bandwidth and large datasets.

### High network bandwidth (1 Gbps - 100 Gbps)

- **AzCopy** - Use this command-line tool to easily copy data to and from Azure Blobs, Files, and Table storage with optimal performance. AzCopy supports concurrency and parallelism, and the ability to resume copy operations when interrupted.
- **Azure Storage REST APIs** – When building an application, you can develop the application against Azure Storage REST APIs and use the Azure client libraries offered in multiple languages.
- **Azure Data Box family for online transfers** – Data Box Edge and Data Box Gateway are online network devices that can move data into and out of Azure. Data Box Edge uses artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Edge compute to pre-process data before upload. Data Box Gateway is a virtual version of the device with the same data transfer capabilities.
- **Azure Data Factory** – Use Azure Data Factory to regularly transfer files between several Azure services, on-premises, or a combination of the two. Using Azure Data Factory, you can create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that ingest data from disparate data stores and automate data movement and data transformation.


## Comparison of key capabilities

The following tables summarize the differences in key capabilities for the recommended options.
