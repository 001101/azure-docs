# Transfer data with AzCopy and blob storage 

## Create a blob container

```azcopy
.\azcopy make "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/container-name"
```

**Create a blob container by using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**

If you've enabled hierarchical namespaces on your Blob storage account, you can use the following command to create a new blob container for uploading files.

```azcopy
.\azcopy make "https://account.dfs.core.windows.net/top-level-resource-name"
```

## Copy data to Azure Storage

Use the copy command to transfer data from the source to the destination. The source or destination can be a:
- Local file system
- Azure Blob/Virtual Directory/Container URI
- Azure File/Directory/File Share URI
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Filesystem/Directory/File URI

```azcopy
.\azcopy copy <source path> <destination path> --<flag-name>=<flag-value>
# Using the alias instead 
.\azcopy cp <source path> <destination path> --<flag-name>=<flag-value>
```

The following command uploads all files under the folder `C:\local\path` recursively to the container `mycontainer1`, creating `path` directory in the container. When `--put-md5` flag is provided, AzCopy calculates and stores each file's md5 hash in `Content-md5` property of the corresponding blob for later use.

```azcopy
.\azcopy cp "C:\local\path" "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1<sastoken>" --recursive=true --put-md5
```

The following command uploads all files under the folder `C:\local\path` (without recursing into the subdirectories) to the container `mycontainer1`:

```azcopy
.\azcopy cp "C:\local\path\*" "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1<sastoken>" --put-md5
```

To find more examples, use the following command:

```azcopy
.\azcopy cp -h
```

## Copy Blob data between two storage accounts

Copying data between two storage accounts uses the [Put Block From URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-from-url) API, and doesn't use the client machine's network bandwidth. Data is copied between two Azure Storage servers directly, while AzCopy simply orchestrates the copy operation. This option is currently only available for Blob storage.

To copy the all of the Blob data between two storage accounts, use the following command:
```azcopy
.\azcopy cp "https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/<sastoken>" "https://myotheraccount.blob.core.windows.net/<sastoken>" --recursive=true
```

To copy a Blob container to another Blob container, use the following command:
```azcopy
.\azcopy cp "https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/<sastoken>" "https://myotheraccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/<sastoken>" --recursive=true
```

## Copy a VHD image to a storage account

AzCopy by default uploads data into block blobs. To upload files as Append Blobs, or Page Blobs use the flag `--blob-type=[BlockBlob|PageBlob|AppendBlob]`.

```azcopy
.\azcopy cp "C:\local\path\mydisk.vhd" "https://myotheraccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/mydisk.vhd<sastoken>" --blob-type=PageBlob
```

## Sync: incremental copy and delete (Blob storage only)

The sync command synchronizes contents of a source directory to a directory in the destination, comparing file names and last modified timestamps. This operation includes the optional deletion of destination files if those do not exist in the source when the `--delete-destination=prompt|true` flag is provided. By default, the delete behavior is disabled. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Use the `--delete-destination` flag with caution. Enable the [soft delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete) feature before you enable delete behavior in sync to prevent accidental deletions in your account. 
>
> When `--delete-destination` is set to true, AzCopy will delete files that do not exist in the source from destination without any prompt to the user. If you want to be prompted for confirmation, use `--delete-destination=prompt`.

To sync your local file system to a storage account, use the following command:

```azcopy
.\azcopy sync "C:\local\path" "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1<sastoken>" --recursive=true
```

You can also sync a blob container down to a local file system:

```azcopy
# The SAS token isn't required for Azure Active Directory authentication.
.\azcopy sync "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1" "C:\local\path" --recursive=true
```

This command incrementally syncs the source to the destination based on the last modified timestamps. If you add or delete a file in the source, AzCopy will do the same in the destination. Before deletion, AzCopy will prompt you to confirm.
