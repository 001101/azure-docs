# Storage Service Encryption using customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault

Microsoft Azure is committed to helping you protect and safeguard your data to
meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. One way you can
protect your data at rest is to use Storage Service Encryption (SSE), which
automatically encrypts your data when writing it to storage, and decrypts your
data when retrieving it. The encryption and decryption is automatic, transparent, and uses 256-bit [AES
encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), one of
the strongest block ciphers available.

You can use Microsoft-managed encryption keys with SSE or you can use your own
encryption keys. This article discusses the latter. For more information about
using Microsoft-managed keys, or about SSE in general, see [Storage Service
Encryption for Data at
Rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-service-encryption).

To provide the ability to use your own encryption keys, SSE for Blob and File
storage is integrated with Azure Key Vault (AKV). You can create your own
encryption keys and store them in AKV, or you can use AKV’s APIs to generate
encryption keys. Not only does AKV allow you to manage and control your keys, it
also enables you to audit your key usage.

Why would you want to create your own keys? It gives you more flexibility,
allowing you to create, rotate, disable, and define access controls. It also
allows you to audit the encryption keys used to protect your data.

## SSE with customer-managed keys preview

This feature is currently in preview. To use this feature, you need to create a new storage account. You can either create a new key vault and key or you can use an existing key vault and key. The storage account and the key vault must be in the same region, but they can be in different subscriptions.

To participate in the preview, contact [ssediscussions@microsoft.com](mailto:ssediscussions@microsoft.com). We will provide a special link to participate in the preview.

To learn more, refer to the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions-about-storage-service-encryption-for-data-at-rest).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must sign up for the preview prior to following the steps in this article. Without preview access, you will not be able to enable this feature in the portal.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a new storage account

[Create a new storage account](../storage-create-storage-account.md)

### Step 2: Enable encryption

You can enable SSE using Customer Managed Keys for the storage account using the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). On the **Settings** blade for the storage
account, as shown in the following figure, click **Encryption**.

<br/>

*Enable SSE for Blob Service*

To enable Storage Service Encryption using Customer Managed Keys, key protection
features – Soft Delete and Do Not Purge must be enabled. These settings ensure
the keys cannot be accidently/intentionally deleted. The maximum retention
period of the keys is set to 90 days protecting users against malicious and
ransomware attacks.

If you want to programmatically enable the Storage Service Encryption on a
storage account, you can use the [Azure Storage Resource Provider REST
API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storagerp/?redirectedfrom=MSDN), the
[Storage Resource Provider Client Library for
.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/?redirectedfrom=MSDN), [Azure
PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/overview?view=azurermps-4.0.0),
or the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-azure-cli).

Note: Identity of the storage account needs to be set to use SSE with Customer
Managed Keys. This can be set by executing the following PowerShell command

Set-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName \$resourceGroup -Name \$accountName
-AssignIdentity

You can programmatically enable Soft Delete and Do Not Purge by executing the
following PowerShell commands

(\$resource = Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceId (Get-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName
\$vaultName).ResourceId).Properties \| Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name
enableSoftDelete -Value 'True'

Set-AzureRmResource -resourceid \$resource.ResourceId -Properties
\$resource.Properties

(\$resource = Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceId (Get-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName
\$vaultName).ResourceId).Properties \| Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name
enablePurgeProtection -Value 'True'

Set-AzureRmResource -resourceid \$resource.ResourceId -Properties
\$resource.Properties

![Portal Screenshot showing Encryption Preview](./media/storage-service-encryption-customer-managed-keys/ssecmk1.png)

By default, SSE uses Microsoft-managed keys. To use your own keys, check the
box. Then you can either specify your key URI, or select a key and Key Vault
from the picker.

### Step 3: Select your key

![Portal Screenshot showing Encryptions use your own key option](./media/storage-service-encryption-customer-managed-keys/ssecmk2.png)

![Portal Screenshot showing Encryption with enter key uri option](./media/storage-service-encryption-customer-managed-keys/ssecmk3.png)

If the storage account does not have access to the Key Vault, you can run the
following command using Azure Powershell to grant access to the storage accounts
to the required key vault.

![Portal Screenshot showing access denied for key vault](./media/storage-service-encryption-customer-managed-keys/ssecmk4.png)

You can also grant access via the Azure portal by going to the Azure Key Vault
in the Azure portal and granting access to the storage account.

### Step 4: Copy data to storage account

If you would like to transfer data into your new storage account so that it’s
encrypted, refer to [Step 3 of Getting Started in Storage Service Encryption for
Data at
Rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-service-encryption#step-3-copy-data-to-storage-account).

### Step 5: Query the status of the encrypted data

To query the status of the encrypted data, refer to [Step 4 of Getting Started
in Storage Service Encryption for Data at
Rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-service-encryption#step-4-query-the-status-of-the-encrypted-data).

## Frequently asked questions about Storage Service Encryption for Data at Rest

**Q: I'm using Premium storage; can I use SSE with customer-managed keys?**

A: Yes, SSE with Microsoft-managed and customer-managed keys is supported on
both Standard storage and Premium storage.

**Q: Can I create new storage accounts with SSE with customer-managed keys
enabled using Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI?**

A: Yes.

**Q: How much more does Azure Storage cost if SSE with customer-managed keys is
enabled?**

A: There is a cost associated for using Azure Key Vault. For more details, visit
[Key Vault
Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/key-vault/). There is
no additional cost for using SSE.

**Q: Can I revoke access to the encryption keys?**

A: Yes, you can revoke access at any time. There are several ways to revoke
access to your keys. Refer to [Azure Key Vault
PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.keyvault/?view=azurermps-4.0.0)
and [Azure Key Vault CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/keyvault) for
more details. Revoking access will effectively block access to all blobs in the
storage account as the Account Encryption Key is inaccessible by Azure Storage.

**Q: Can I create a storage account and key in different region?**

A: No, the storage account and key vault/key need to be in the same region.

**Q: Can I enable SSE with customer-managed keys while creating the storage
account?**

A: No. When you enable SSE while creating the storage account, you can only use
Microsoft-managed keys. If you would like to use customer-managed keys, you must
update the storage account properties. You can use REST or one of the storage
client libraries to programmatically update your storage account, or update the
storage account properties using the Azure portal after creating the account.

**Q: Can I disable encryption while using SSE with customer-managed keys?**

A: No, you cannot disable encryption. Encryption is enabled by default for all
services – Blob, File, Table and Queue storage. You can only switch to using
Microsoft Managed Keys from Customer-managed keys.

**Q: Is SSE enabled by default when I create a new storage account?**

A: SSE is enabled by default for all services – Blob, File, Table, and Queue
storage.

**Q: I can't enable encryption using customer-managed keys on my storage account.**

A: Is it a Resource Manager storage account? Classic storage accounts are not
supported. SSE with customer-managed keys can only be enabled on Resource
Manager storage accounts.

**Q: What is Soft Delete and Do Not Purge? Do I need to enable this setting to use SSE with Customer Managed Keys?**

A: Soft Delete and Do Not Purge must be enabled to use SSE with Customer Managed
Keys. These are settings to ensure your key is not accidently/intentionally
deleted. The maximum retention period of the keys is set to 90 days protecting
users against malicious and ransomware attacks. This setting cannot be disabled.

**Q: Is SSE with customer-managed keys only permitted in specific regions?**

A: SSE is available in all regions for Blob and File storage.

**Q: How do I contact someone if I have any issues or want to provide feedback?**
