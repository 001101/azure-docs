# Choose an Azure solution for data transfer

This article provides an overview of all the Azure data transfer solutions and links out to recommended options depending on the network bandwidth in your environment and the size of the data you intend to transfer.

## Types of data movement

Data transfer can be offline or over the network connection. Choose your solution depending on your:

- **Data size** - Size of the data intended for transfer,
- **Transfer frequency** - One-time or periodic data ingestion, and
- **Network** â€“ Bandwidth available for data transfer in your environment.

The data movement can be of the following types:

- **Shippable devices** - Use physical shippable devices when you want to do offline one-time bulk data transfer. Microsoft sends you a disk, or a secure specialized device. Alternatively, you can purchase and ship your own disks. You copy data to the device and then ship it to Azure where the data is uploaded.  The available options for this case are Data Box Disk, Data Box, Data Box Heavy, and Import/Export (use your own disks).

- **Network Transfer** - You transfer your data to Azure over your network connection as you have moderate to high network bandwidth.  This can be done in many ways.

    - **Graphical interface** - If you occasionally transfer just a few files and do not need to automate the data transfer, you can choose a graphical interface tool such as Azure Storage Explorer or a web-based exploration tool in Azure portal.
    - **Scripted or programmatic transfer** - You can use optimized software tools that we provide or call our REST APIs directly. The available options are AzCopy, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Azure Storage REST APIs.
    - **On-premises devices** - We supply you a physical or virtual device that resides in your datacenter and optimizes data transfer over the network. These devices also provide a local cache of frequently used files. The physical device is the Data Box Edge and the virtual device is the Data Box Gateway. Both run permanently in your premises and connect to Azure over the network.
    - **Data pipeline** - You can set up a cloud pipeline to regularly transfer files between several Azure services, on-premises or a combination of two. Use Azure Data Factory to set up and manage data pipelines, and move and transform data for analysis.

The following visual illustrates how the various Azure data transfer tools can be used depending upon the network bandwidth available for transfer, data size intended for transfer, and frequency of the transfer.

## Selecting a data transfer solution

Answer the following questions to help select a data transfer solution:

- Is your available network bandwidth limited or non-existent, and you want to transfer large datasets? If yes, see: [Scenario 1: Transfer large datasets with no or low network bandwidth](storage-solution-large-dataset-low-network.md).
- Do you want to transfer large datasets over network and you have a moderate to high network bandwidth? If yes, see: [Scenario 2: Transfer large datasets with moderate to high network bandwidth](storage-solution-large-dataset-moderate-high-network.md).
- Do you want to occasionally transfer just a few files over the network? If yes, see [Scenario 3: Transfer small datasets with limited to moderate network bandwidth](storage-solution-small-dataset-low-moderate-network.md).
- Are you looking for point-in-time data transfer at regular intervals? If yes, use the scripted/programmatic options outlined in [Scenario 4: Periodic data transfers](storage-solution-periodic-data-transfer.md).
- Are you looking for on-going, continuous data transfer? If yes, use the options in [Scenario 4: Periodic data transfers](storage-solution-periodic-data-transfer.md).
