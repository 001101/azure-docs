# Azure Storage redundancy

Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data to ensure durability and high availability. Azure Storage copies your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets the [Service-Level Agreement (SLA) for Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage/) even in the face of failures.

Azure Storage regularly verifies the integrity of data stored using cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). If data corruption is detected, it is repaired using redundant data. Azure Storage also calculates checksums on all network traffic to detect corruption of data packets when storing or retrieving data.

## Redundancy in the primary region

Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region:

- **Locally redundant storage (LRS)** copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. LRS is the least expensive replication option, but is not recommended for applications requiring high availability.
- **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)** copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.

## Redundancy in a secondary region

For applications requiring high availability, you can choose to additionally copy the data in your storage account to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region. If your storage account is copied to a secondary region, then your data is durable even in the case of a complete regional outage or a disaster in which the primary region isn't recoverable.

When you create a storage account, you select the primary region for the account. The paired secondary region is determined based on the primary region, and can't be changed. For up-to-date information about regions supported by Azure, see [Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR): Azure paired regions](../../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md).

Azure Storage offers two options for copying your data to a secondary region:

- **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)** copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region.
- **Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)** (preview) copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region using ZRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region.

The primary difference between GRS and GZRS is how data is replicated in the primary region. Within the secondary location, data is always replicated synchronously three times using LRS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Asynchronous replication involves a delay from the time that data is written to the primary region, to when it is replicated to the secondary region. In the event of a regional disaster, changes that haven't yet been replicated to the secondary region may be lost if that data can't be recovered from the primary region.

With GRS or GZRS, the data in the secondary location isn't available for read or write access unless Microsoft initiates a failover to the secondary region. In the case of a failover, you'll have read and write access to that data after the failover has completed. For more information, see [Disaster recovery guidance](storage-disaster-recovery-guidance.md).

For read access to the secondary location, configure your storage account to use read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS). For more information, see [Read access to data in the secondary region](#read-access-to-data-in-the-secondary-region).

### Geo-redundant storage

## Read access to data in the secondary region

GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, but that data is available to be read only if Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region.

Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) is based on GRS. RA-GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, and also provides you with the option to read from the secondary region. With RA-GRS, you can read from the secondary region regardless of whether Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region.

## Choosing a redundancy configuration

When you create a storage account, you can select one of the following redundancy configurations:

The following table provides a quick overview of the scope of durability and availability that each redundancy configuration will provide you for a given type of event (or event of similar impact).

<sup>2</sup> For information for storage account types, see [Storage account overview](storage-account-overview.md).

All data for all types of storage accounts are replicated. Objects including block blobs, append blobs, page blobs, queues, tables, and files are replicated.

For pricing information for each redundancy configuration, see [Azure Storage Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Premium Disk Storage currently supports only locally redundant storage (LRS). Azure Premium Block Blob Storage supports locally redundant storage (LRS) and zone redundant storage (ZRS) in certain regions.

## Changing redundancy configuration

You can change your storage account's redundancy configuration by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), [Azure Powershell](storage-powershell-guide-full.md), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), or one of the [Azure Storage client libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/index#pivot=sdkstools). Changing the replication type of your storage account does not result in down time.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you cannot use the Azure portal or the Azure Storage client libraries to convert your account to ZRS, GZRS, or RA-GZRS. To migrate your account to ZRS, see [Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) for building highly available Azure Storage applications](storage-redundancy-zrs.md) for details. To migrate GZRS or RA-GZRS, see [Geo-zone-redundant storage for highly availability and maximum durability (preview)](storage-redundancy-zrs.md) for details.

Costs associated with changing your storage account's redundancy configuration depend on your conversion path. Ordering from least to the most expensive, Azure Storage redundancy offerings include LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS, GZRS, and RA-GZRS. For example, going *from* LRS to any other type of replication will incur additional charges because you are moving to a more sophisticated redundancy level. Migrating *to* GRS or RA-GRS will incur an egress bandwidth charge because your data (in your primary region) is being replicated to your remote secondary region. This charge is a one-time cost at initial setup. After the data is copied, there are no further migration charges. You are only charged for replicating any new or updates to existing data. For details on bandwidth charges, see [Azure Storage Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).

If you migrate your storage account from GRS to LRS, there is no additional cost, but your replicated data is deleted from the secondary location.

If you migrate your storage account from RA-GRS to GRS or LRS, that account is billed as RA-GRS for an additional 30 days beyond the date that it was converted.
