Storage accounts replicated with [geo-redundant storage (GRS)](storage-redundancy-grs.md) or read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) support forced failover (preview). In the event that the primary region for your storage account becomes unavailable, forced failover enables you to control when you fail over to the secondary region. When you force a failover to the secondary region, clients can immediately begin writing data to the secondary endpoint. Forced failover helps you to maintain high availability for your customers. 

Forced failover is enabled for all new and existing storage accounts configured for geo-redundant storage (GRS) or read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS). Microsoft recommends using RA-GRS for applications requiring high availability. 
    
Once you initiate a forced failover, all data in the storage account, including blob, disk, file, queue, and table data, is failed over. Forced failover is available only to Azure Resource Manager deployments. General-purpose v1, General-purpose v2, and Blob storage account types are supported.

> [!WARNING]
> Forcing a failover results in the loss of any data written to the primary region after the time indicated by the **Last Sync Time** property. Before you force a failover, make sure that you understand the implications for your data.

## About the preview

Forced failover is currently available in preview in these regions:

- US-West 2
- US West Central

The preview is intended for non-production use only. Production service-level agreements (SLAs) are not currently available.

## How it works 

Azure Storage accounts configured for GRS or RA-GRS are replicated in two geographically separate regions. In the event that data in the primary region becomes temporarily unavailable, the data maintained in the secondary region can serve to keep your applications running with limited impact to customers.

By default, if the primary region becomes unavailable, Microsoft fails over to the secondary region. The secondary region then becomes the new primary region. 



Account failover is available for both [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs) or [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) accounts. To achieve high availability, we recommend using RA-GRS accounts. With these options of redundancy, Azure Storage will keep your data durable in two regions (primary and secondary). In both regions, Azure Storage constantly maintains multiple replicas of your data.

In the event of a regional disaster or primary unavailability, you can initiate account failover that will failover your entire account to the secondary region. Cross-region data replication is an asynchronous process that involves a delay, so it is possible that changes which have not yet been replicated to the secondary region may be lost.

**Please read below to fully understand what to expect and the implications of account failover**

-   Account failover can only be triggered on both Azure Resource Manager GP v1, GP v2 accounts and Blob storage accounts. It is not available for Classic storage accounts.

-   Account failover can be triggered only on RAGRS and GRS accounts. It is not available for ZRS account yet.

-   Before triggering account failover, you can check the status of secondary end point on how far the replication by using Last Sync Time. This will provide an estimate on the amount of data you will lose as part of the failover.

-   Your existing storage service endpoints for blobs, tables, queues, and files will remain the same after the failover; the Microsoft-supplied DNS entry will be automatically updated as part of the account failover process.

-   During account failover, you won't have read and write access to your storage account

-   When the account failover has been completed and the DNS changes propagated, read and write access to your storage account are restored if you have GRS or RA-GRS. The endpoint that was previously your secondary endpoint becomes your primary endpoint.

-   After account failover is completed your storage account will be fully functioning but in a “degraded” state and converted to LRS. You can re-enable your storage account to GRS or RA-GRS. Your data will be geo-replicated from your new primary to secondary region.

-   You can check the status of the primary location and query the last geo-failover time for your storage account.

Supported Scenarios
===================

VM Scenarios

1.  Shutdown the VM

2.  Conduct failover

3.  After failover is completed, vhds are only copied so you will need to reattach the vhds and restart the VMs in the new primary region

4.  Any data in the temp disk will be lost

5.  Check on how user can query LST for page blobs

Azure Files Sync

Large File Shares

Manage Disks – is not a supported scenario because Microsoft manages the storage account

Archive scenarios

VNET – do users have to recreate the VNET settings after failover is completed

ADLS gen 2 –

Premium Block Blobs -

Best Practices
==============

When do use force failover- only when primary unavailability and regional disaster. Since this will have data loss. For the best RPO, wait for Microsoft to try and bring up the primary. For RTO you can trigger failover.



## Enable failover for your Azure Storage account

### Azure portal

1.  From your Azure Storage account, open the Geo Replication pane

    ![](media/storage-account-failover/portal-failover-prepare.png)

2.  Verify that your storage account is configured for GRS or RA-GRS. If it is not, you can upgrade the account to use GRS or RA-GRS using the **Configuration** settings.

3.  Last Sync Time indicates how far behind the secondary is behind from the primary. This provides an estimate of the data loss that you will experience after the failover is completed

4.  Click on Prepare for failover (preview) to understand implications of failover and confirm failover.

5.  After you type in ‘yes’ failover will start. The status of end point and failover is indicated as shown below.
6.

6.  Primary and Secondary endpoints will be swapped after failover.

7.  After failover is completed your storage account will be converted to LRS.

8.  You can convert it to RA-GRS or GRS after geo is stabilized. This will take around 15 minutes.

### Azure PowerShell

Invoke-AzureRmStorageAccountFailover -ResourceGroupName \$RGName -Name \$AccountName

Version of powershell – mention this.
