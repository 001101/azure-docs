# Use the Microsoft Azure Import/Export service to export data to Azure Blob storage
In this article, we provide step-by-step instructions on using Azure Import/Export service to securely transfer large amounts of data from Azure Blob storage. 

To export data from Azure Blobs, the service requires you to ship empty drives to which data is tranferred the Azure datacenter. The service exports data from your storage account to the drives. The drives are then shipped to you.

## Prerequisites

## Step 1: Prepare your drives
Following pre-checks are recommended for preparing your drives for an export job:

1. Check the number of disks required using the WAImportExport tool's PreviewExport command. For more information, see [Previewing Drive Usage for an Export Job](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn722414.aspx). It helps you preview drive usage for the blobs you selected, based on the size of the drives you are going to use.
2. Check that you can read/write to the hard drive that will be shipped for the export job.

## Step 2: Create an export job

Perform the following steps to create an import job in the Azure portal.
1. Log on to https://portal.azure.com/.
2. Go to **More services > Storage > Import/export jobs**. Click **Create Import/export Job**.
3. In **Basics**, do the following:
    
    - Select **Export from Azure**. 
    - Enter a string for job name.
    - Select a subscription.
    - Enter or select a resource group. 
    - Enter a descriptive name for the import job. Use the name you choose to track the progress of your jobs. 
        - The name may contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
        - The name must start with a letter, and may not contain spaces. 
    - Provide the contact information for the person responsible for this export job.

3. In **Job details**, do the following:

    - Select the storage account where the data to be exported resides. 
    - The drop-off location is automatically populated based on the region of the storage account selected. 
    - Specify the blob data you wish to export from your storage account to your blank drive or drives. You can choose to export all blob data in the storage account, or you can specify which blobs or sets of blobs to export.
        - **To specify a blob to export**: Use the **Equal To** selector. Specify the relative path to the blob, beginning with the container name. Use *$root* to specify the root container.
        - **To specify all blobs starting with a prefix**: Use the **Starts With** selector. Specify the prefix, beginning with a forward slash '/'. The prefix may be the prefix of the container name, the complete container name, or the complete container name followed by the prefix of the blob name.
    
        You must provide the blob paths in valid formats to avoid errors during processing, as shown in this screenshot. See [Examples of valid blob paths](#examples-of-valid-blob-paths).

4. In **Return shipping info**, do the following:

    - Select the carrier from the drop-down list.
    - Enter a valid carrier account number that you have created with that carrier. Microsoft uses this account to ship the drives back to you once your import job is complete. 
    - Provide a complete and valid contact name, phone, email, street address, city, zip, state/province and country/region.
   
5. In the **Summary**, do the following:

    - Rrovide the Azure datacenter shipping address for shipping disks back to Azure. Ensure that the job name and the full address are mentioned on the shipping label.
    - Click **OK** to complete Export job creation.

## Step 3: Ship the drives

FedEx, UPS, or DHL can be used to ship the package to Azure datacenter. You must provide a valid FedEx, UPS, or DHL carrier account number to be used by Microsoft for shipping the drives back. 
- A FedEx, UPS, or DHL account number is required for shipping drives back from the US and Europe locations. 
- A DHL account number is required for shipping drives back from Asia and Australia locations. If you do not have one, you can create a [FedEx](http://www.fedex.com/us/oadr/) (for US and Europe) or [DHL](http://www.dhl.com/) (Asia and Australia) carrier account. 

In shipping your packages, you must follow the terms at [Microsoft Azure Service Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/services-terms/).

## Step 4: Update the job with tracking information

After shipping the disks, return to the **Import/Export** page on the Azure portal to update the tracking number. Do the following steps. 

1. Click the import job.
2. Click **Update job status and tracking info once drives are shipped**. 
3. Select the check box **Mark as shipped**.
4. Provide the **Carrier** and **Tracking number**. If the tracking number is not updated within 2 weeks of creating the job, the job expires. 
5. Monitor the job progress on the portal dashboard. See what each job state in the previous section means by [Viewing your job status](#viewing-your-job-status).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the blob to be exported is in use at the time of copying to hard drive, Azure Import/Export service will take a snapshot of the blob and copy the snapshot.
 
6. After you receive the drives with your exported data, you can view and copy the BitLocker keys generated by the service for your drive. Go to the export job in the Azure portal. Click Import/Export tab. 
7. Select your export job from the list, and click **BitLocker keys**. The BitLocker keys appear as shown below:

## Examples of valid blob paths

The following table shows examples of valid blob paths:
   
   | Selector | Blob Path | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Starts With |/ |Exports all blobs in the storage account |
   | Starts With |/$root/ |Exports all blobs in the root container |
   | Starts With |/book |Exports all blobs in any container that begins with prefix **book** |
   | Starts With |/music/ |Exports all blobs in container **music** |
   | Starts With |/music/love |Exports all blobs in container **music** that begin with prefix **love** |
   | Equal To |$root/logo.bmp |Exports blob **logo.bmp** in the root container |
   | Equal To |videos/story.mp4 |Exports blob **story.mp4** in container **videos** |
