# Use the Azurite storage emulator for development and testing (preview)

The Azurite emulator (preview) provides a local storage environment for development and testing purposes. Using Azurite, you can test your application against storage services locally, without creating an Azure subscription or incurring any costs. When you're satisfied with how your application is working in the emulator, you can switch to using an Azure Storage account in the cloud.

Azurite is an open source Azure Storage API compatible emulator. Based on Node.js, Azurite provides cross platform experiences for developers wanting to easily try Azure Storage in a local environment. Azurite simulates most of the commands supported by Azure Storage with minimal dependencies.

Azurite v3 implements a new architecture from previous versions. It leverages code generated by a TypeScript server code generator that Microsoft created. The generator uses the same modified Swagger code used by the Azure Storage SDKs. This reduces manual effort and facilitates better code alignment with the Azure Storage APIs.

## Get Azurite version 3

Azurite is available in a GitHub repository, which you can easily clone, build, and deploy on your local system. It also ships as a Visual Studio Code extension so you can launch directly from your development environment.

### Prerequisites

* [GitHub account](https://github.com)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Install the storage emulator from GitHub

To get the Azurite emulator on your local system, clone the GitHub repository for the project by using the following console command.

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure/Azurite.git
```

After cloning source code, execute following commands to install and start Azurite v3.

```console
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g
azurite
```

## Running Azurite

In order to run Azurite v3 you need Node.js >= 8.0 installed on your system. Azurite works cross-platform on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

After installation you can install Azurite simply with **npm** which is the Node.js package management tool included with every Node.js installation.

```console
npm install -g azurite
```

Start Azurite with the following command:

```console
azurite -s -l c:\azurite -d c:\azurite\debug.log
```

or

```console
azurite --silent --location c:\azurite --debug c:\azurite\debug.log
```

This tells Azurite to store all data in a particular directory **c:\azurite**. If the **-l** option is omitted it will use the current working directory. You can also selectively start different storage services.

For example, to start the blob service only:

```console
azurite-blob -l path/to/azurite/workspace
```

### Command line syntax

```console
azurite [--blobHost <IP address>] [--blobPort <port address>] [-l | --location <workspace path>] [-s | --silent] [-d | --debug <log file path>]
```

## Supported command line options

### Listening host configuration

**Optional** By default, Azurite v3 will listen to 127.0.0.1 as a local server.
You can customize the listening address per your requirements.

Accept requests on the local machine only:

```console
--blobHost 127.0.0.1
```

Allow remote requests (potentially unsafe):

```console
--blobHost 0.0.0.0
```

### Listening port configuration

**Optional** By default, Azurite v3 will listen for the blob service on port 10000. You can customize the listening port for your own requirements.

> [!WARNING]
> After using a customized port, you need to update the connection string or corresponding configuration in your Azure Storage tools or SDKs.

Customize the Blob Service listening port:

```console
--blobPort 8888
```

Let system auto select an available port:

```console
--blobPort 0
```

> [!NOTE]
> The port in use is displayed on Azurite startup.

### Workspace path configuration

**Optional** Azurite v3 needs to persist metadata and binary data to the local disk during execution. You can provide a customized path as the workspace location, or by default, the current process working directory will be used.

```console
-l c:\azurite
--location c:\azurite
```

### Access log configuration

**Optional** By default Azurite will display the access log in the console window. Disable it by using the **--silent** switch:

```console
-s
--silent
```

### Debug log configuration

**Optional** Debug log includes detailed information on every request and exception stack traces. Enable it by providing a valid local file path for the debug log destination.

```console
-d path/debug.log
--debug path/debug.log
```

### Command line options differences between Azurite v2

Azurite v3 supports SharedKey, account Shared Access Signature (SAS), Service SAS, and Public Container Access authentications. You may use any Azure Storage SDKs or tools like Storage Explorer to connect Azurite v3 with any authentication strategy. Authentication cannot be bypassed in Azurite v3.

## Usage with Azure Storage SDKs and tools

### Default Storage Account

Azurite v3 provides support for a General Storage Account v2 and associated features by default.

* Account name: `devstoreaccount1`
* Account key: `Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==`

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to SharedKey authentication, Azurite v3 supports account and service SAS authentication. Anonymous access is also available when a container is set to allow public access.

### Connection string

Typically, you can pass following connection strings to SDKs or tools (like Azure CLI2.0 or Storage Explorer). Using the blob service as an example, the full connection string is:

```http
DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;
```

Or if the SDK or tools support following short connection string:

```http
UseDevelopmentStorage=true;
```

### Storage Explorer

Connect to Azurite by clicking the **Add Account** icon, then select **Attach to a local emulator** and click **Connect**.

## Differences between Azurite and Azure Storage

Because Azurite runs as a local instance for persistent data storage, there are differences in functionality between Azurite and an Azure storage account in the cloud.

### Storage accounts

Azurite v3 supports a default account as General Storage Account v2 and provides features.

* Account name: `devstoreaccount1`
* Account key: `Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==`

### Endpoint and connection URL

The service endpoints for Azurite are different from those of an Azure storage account. The difference is because the local computer does not perform domain name resolution, requiring Azurite endpoints to be local addresses.

When you address a resource in an Azure storage account, use the following scheme. The account name is part of the URI host name, and the resource being addressed is part of the URI path:

`<http|https>://<account-name>.<service-name>.core.windows.net/<resource-path>`

For example, the following URI is a valid address for a blob in an Azure storage account:

`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

However, because the local computer does not perform domain name resolution, the account name is part of the URI path instead of the host name. Use the following URI format for a resource in Azurite:

`http://<local-machine-address>:<port>/<account-name>/<resource-path>`

For example, the following address might be used for accessing a blob in Azurite:

`http://127.0.0.1:10000/myaccount/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

The service endpoints for Azurite blob service:

`http://127.0.0.1:10000/<account-name>/<resource-path>`

### Scalability and performance

Azurite is not a scalable storage service and does not support many concurrent clients. There is also no performance or TPS guarantee, they highly depend on the environments Azurite has deployed.

### Error handling

Azurite tries to align with Azure Storage error handling logic and provides best-efforts alignment based on Azure Storage online documentation. But CANNOT provide 100% alignment, such as error messages (returned in error response body) maybe different (while error status code will align).

### API version strategy

Azurite v3 follows a **Try best to serve** compatible strategy with Azure Storage API versions:

* An Azurite v3 instance has a baseline Azure Storage API version.
  * A Swagger definition (OpenAPI doc) with the same API version will be used to generate protocol layer APIs and interfaces.
  * Azurite should implement all the possible features provided in this API service version.
* If an incoming request has **the same API version** Azurite provides, Azurite should handle the request with parity to Azure Storage.
* If an incoming request has a **higher API version** than Azurite, Azurite will return a VersionNotSupportedByEmulator error (HTTP status code 400 - Bad Request).
* If an incoming request has a **lower API version** header than Azurite, Azurite will attempt to handle the request with Azuriteâ€™s baseline API version behavior instead of that specified in the request.
* Azurite will return API version in response header as the baseline API version
* SAS accepts pattern from API version 2015-04-05

### RA-GRS

Azurite supports read-access geo-redundant replication (RA-GRS). For storage resources both in the cloud and in the local emulator, you can access the secondary location by appending -secondary to the account name. For example, the following address might be used for accessing a blob using the read-only secondary in Azurite:

`http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1-secondary/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

## Differences between Azurite v3 and Azurite v2

Both Azurite v3 and Azurite v2 aim to provide a convenient emulation for customers to quickly try out Azure Storage services locally. There are lots of differences between Azurite v3 and legacy Azurite v2.

### Architecture

The Azurite v3 architecture has been refactored. It's now more flexible and robust. Azurite v3 provides the flexibility to support following scenarios in the future:

* Use other HTTP frameworks instead of express.js
* A customized new handler layer implementation, such as redirecting requests to Azure Storage services
* Implement and inject a new persistency layer implementation, such as one based on a different database service
* Provide support for multiple azure storage accounts and authentication
* Detailed debug logging for easy issue investigation and request tracking
* Create an HTTPS server

### Server code generator

Azurite v3 leverages a TypeScript server code generator based on Azure Storage REST API swagger specifications. This reduces manual efforts and ensures alignment with the API implementation.

### TypeScript

Azurite v3 was created using TypeScript. This facilitates broad collaboration, while also ensuring quality.

### Features scope

Legacy Azurite v2 supports Azure Storage Blob, Queue and Table services. Azurite v3 currently supports the Azure Storage Blob Service, with Queue support scheduled to follow soon. Azure Table Service support is currently under discussion.

Azurite v3 supports features from Azure Storage API version 2018-03-28, and will maintain parity with the latest API versions, in a more frequent update frequency than legacy Azurite v2.
