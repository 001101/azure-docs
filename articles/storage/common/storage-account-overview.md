# Azure storage account overview

An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. Data in your Azure storage account is durable and highly available, secure, massively scalable, and accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. 

To learn how to create an Azure storage account, see [Create a storage account](storage-quickstart-create-account.md).

## Types of storage accounts

Azure Storage provides three types of storage accounts. Each type supports different features and has its own pricing model. Consider these differences before you create a storage account to determine the type of account that is best for your applications. The types of storage accounts are:

* **General-purpose v2** accounts (recommended)
* **General-purpose v1** accounts
* **Blob storage** accounts

The following table describes the types of storage accounts and their capabilities:

| Storage account type | Supported services                       | Supported performance tiers | Supported access tiers               | Replication options                                                | Deployment model<sup>1</sup>  | Encryption<sup>2</sup> |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| General-purpose V2   | Blob, File, Queue, Table, and Disk       | Standard, Premium           | Hot, Cool, Archive<sup>3</sup> | LRS, ZRS<sup>4</sup>, GRS, RA-GRS | Resource Manager | Encrypted  |
| General-purpose V1   | Blob, File, Queue, Table, and Disk       | Standard, Premium           | N/A                                  | LRS, GRS, RA-GRS                                                   | Resource Manager, Classic  | Encrypted  |
| Blob storage         | Blob (block blobs and append blobs only) | Standard                    | Hot, Cool, Archive<sup>3</sup>                            | LRS, GRS, RA-GRS                                                   | Resource Manager  | Encrypted  |

<sup>1</sup>Using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model is recommended. Storage accounts using the classic deployment model can still be created in some locations, and existing classic accounts continue to be supported. For more information, see [Azure Resource Manager vs. classic deployment: Understand deployment models and the state of your resources](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md).

<sup>2</sup>All storage accounts are encryption using Storage Service Encryption (SSE) for data at rest. For more information, see [Azure Storage Service Encryption for Data at Rest](storage-service-encryption.md).

<sup>3</sup>The archive tier is available at the individual blob level only, not at the storage account level. Only block blobs and append blobs can be archived. For more information, see [Azure Blob storage: Hot, cool, and archive storage tiers](../blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers.md).

<sup>4</sup>Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) is available only for standard general-purpose v2 storage accounts. For more information about ZRS, see [Zone-redundant storage (ZRS): Highly available Azure Storage applications](storage-redundancy-zrs.md). For more information about other replication options, see [Azure Storage replication](storage-redundancy.md).

### General-purpose v2

General-purpose v2 storage accounts support the latest Azure Storage features and incorporate all of the functionality of general-purpose v1 and Blob storage accounts. General-purpose v2 accounts are recommended for most storage scenarios. General-purpose v2 accounts deliver the lowest per-gigabyte capacity prices for Azure Storage, as well as industry-competitive transaction prices.

General-purpose v2 storage accounts offer multiple access tiers for storing data based on your usage patterns. For more information, see [Access tiers for blob data](#access-tiers-for-blob-data).

### General-purpose v1

General-purpose v1 accounts provide access to all Azure Storage services, but may not have the latest features or the lowest per gigabyte pricing. While general-purpose v2 accounts are recommended in most cases, general-purpose v1 accounts are best suited to these scenarios: 

* Your applications require the Azure classic deployment model. General-purpose v2 accounts and Blob storage accounts support only the Azure Resource Manager deployment model.

* Your applications are transaction-intensive or use significant geo-replication bandwidth, but do not require large capacity. In this case, general-purpose v1 may be the most economical choice.

* You use a version of the [Storage Services REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd894041.aspx) that is earlier than 2014-02-14 or a client library with a version lower than 4.x, and cannot upgrade your application.

### Blob storage accounts

A Blob storage account is a specialized storage account for storing unstructured data as blobs (objects). Blob storage accounts provide the same durability, availability, scalability, and performance features that are available with general-purpose v2 storage accounts. Blob storage accounts support block blobs and append blobs, but not page blobs.

Blob storage accounts offer multiple access tiers for storing data based on your usage patterns. For more information, see [Access tiers for blob data](#access-tiers-for-blob-data).

## Performance tiers

General-purpose storage accounts have two performance tiers:

* A standard storage performance tier for storing blobs, files, tables, queues, and Azure virtual machine disks. For more information about standard storage, see [Cost-effective Standard Storage and unmanaged and managed Azure VM disks](../../virtual-machines/windows/standard-storage.md).
* A premium storage performance tier for storing Azure virtual machine disks. See [Premium Storage: High-Performance Storage for Azure Virtual Machine Workloads](../../virtual-machines/windows/premium-storage.md) for an in-depth overview of Premium storage.

## Access tiers for blob data

Azure Storage provides different options for accessing data based on usage patterns. Each access tier in Azure Storage is optimized for a particular pattern of data usage. By selecting the right access tier for your needs, you can store your blob data in the most cost-effective manner.

The available access tiers are:

* The **hot** access tier, which is optimized for frequent access of objects in the storage account. Accessing data in the hot tier is most cost-effective, while storage costs are somewhat higher. New storage accounts are created in the hot tier by default.
* The **cool** access tier, which is optimized for storing large amounts of data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days. Storing data in the cool tier is more cost-effective, but accessing that data may be somewhat more expensive than accessing data in the hot tier.
* The **archive** tier, which is available only for individual block blobs. The archive tier is optimized for data that can tolerate several hours of retrieval latency and will remain in the archive tier for at least 180 days. The archive tier is the most cost-effective option for storing data, but accessing that data is more expensive than accessing data in the hot or cool tiers. 

If there is a change in the usage pattern of your data, you can switch between these access tiers at any time. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing the access tier for an existing storage account or blob may result in additional charges.

For more information about access tiers, see [Azure Blob storage: Hot, cool, and archive storage tiers](../blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers.md).

## Replication

[!INCLUDE [storage-common-redundancy-options](../../../includes/storage-common-redundancy-options.md)]

For more information about storage replication, see [Azure Storage replication](storage-redundancy.md).

## Encryption

All data in your storage account is encrypted on the service side. For more information about encryption, see [Azure Storage Service Encryption for data at rest](storage-service-encryption.md).

## Storage account endpoints

A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. The combination of the account name and the Azure Storage service endpoint forms the endpoints for your storage account.

For example, if your general-purpose storage account is named *mystorageaccount*, then the default endpoints for that account are:

* Blob storage: http://*mystorageaccount*.blob.core.windows.net
* Table storage: http://*mystorageaccount*.table.core.windows.net
* Queue storage: http://*mystorageaccount*.queue.core.windows.net
* Azure Files: http://*mystorageaccount*.file.core.windows.net

> [!NOTE]
> A Blob storage account exposes only the Blob service endpoint.

The URL for accessing an object in a storage account is constructed by appending the object's location in the storage account to the endpoint. For example, a blob address might have this format: http://*mystorageaccount*.blob.core.windows.net/*mycontainer*/*myblob*.

You can also configure your storage account to use a custom domain for blobs. For more information, see [Configure a custom domain name for your Azure Storage account](../blobs/storage-custom-domain-name.md).  

## Control access to account data

By default, the data in your account is available only to you, the account owner. You have control over who may access your data and what permissions they have.

Every request made against your storage account must be authorized. At the level of the service, the request must include a valid *Authorization* header, which includes all of the information necessary for the service to validate the request before executing it.

You can grant access to the data in your storage account using any of the following approaches:

- Use Azure AD credentials to authenticate a user, group, or other identity (preview). If authentication of an identity is successful, then Azure AD returns a token, which is used to authorize the request to Azure Blob storage or Queue storage. For more information, see [Authenticate access to Azure Storage using Azure Active Directory (Preview)](storage-auth-aad.md). 
- Use a shared access signature to delegate access to resources in your storage account. A shared access signature is a token that encapsulates all of the information needed to authorize a request to Azure Storage on the URL. You can specify the storage resource, the permissions granted, and the interval over which the permissions are valid as part of the shared access signature. For more information, see [Using shared access signatures (SAS)](storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1.md).
