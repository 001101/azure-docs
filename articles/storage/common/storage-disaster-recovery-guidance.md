# Disaster recovery and forced failover (preview) in Azure Storage

Microsoft strives to ensure that Azure services are always available. However, unplanned service outages may occur from time to time in one or more regions. If your application requires resiliency, Microsoft recommends using geo-redundant storage, so that your data is replicated in a second region. Additionally, customers should have a disaster recovery plan in place for handling a regional service outage. A key part of a disaster recovery plan is preparing to fail over to the secondary region in the event that the primary region becomes unavailable. 

Azure Storage supports customer-managed forced failover (preview) for geo-redundant storage accounts. With forced failover, you can initiate the failover process for your storage account if the primary region becomes unavailable. The failover updates the secondary region to become the primary region for your storage account. Once the failover is complete, clients can begin writing to the new primary region.

This article describes to use geo-redundancy to how you can fail over to the secondary region in the event that the primary region becomes unavailable. and how to prepare your storage account for recovery with the least amount of customer impact.

## Choose the right redundancy option

All storage accounts are replicated for redundancy. Which redundancy option you choose for your account depends on the level of resiliency you need. For  protection against regional outages, choose geo-redundant storage, with or without the option of read access from the secondary region:  

**Geo-redundant storage (GRS)** replicates your data asynchronously in two geographic regions that are at least hundreds of miles apart. If the primary region suffers an outage, then the secondary region serves as a redundant source for your data. You can initiate a failover to transform the secondary region into the primary region.

**Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)** provides geo-redundant storage with the additional benefit of read access to the secondary region. If an outage occurs in the primary region, applications configured for RA-GRS and designed for high availability can continue to read from the secondary region. Microsoft recommends RA-GRS for maximum resiliency for your applications.

Other Azure Storage redundancy options include zone-redundant storage (ZRS), which replicates your data across availability zones in a single region, and locally redundant storage (LRS), which replicates your data in a single data center in a single region. If your storage account is configured for ZRS or LRS, you can convert that account to use GRS or RA-GRS. Configuring your account for geo-redundant storage incurs additional costs. For more information, see [Azure Storage replication](storage-redundancy.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Cross-region data replication is an asynchronous process that involves a delay, so write operations to the primary region that have not yet been replicated to the secondary region will be lost in the event of an outage. 

## Design for high availability

It's important to design your application for high availability from the start. Refer to these Azure resources for guidance in designing your application and planning for disaster recovery:

* [Designing resilient applications for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/resiliency/): An overview of the key concepts for architecting highly available applications in Azure.
* [Availability checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/checklist/availability): A checklist for verifying that your application implements the best design practices for high availability.
* [Designing highly available applications using RA-GRS](storage-designing-ha-apps-with-ragrs.md): Design guidance for building applications to take advantage of RA-GRS.
* [Tutorial: Build a highly available application with Blob storage](../blobs/storage-create-geo-redundant-storage.md): A tutorial that shows how to build a highly available application that automatically switches between endpoints as failures and recoveries are simulated. 

Additionally, keep in mind these best practices for maintaining high availability for your Azure Storage data:

* **Disks:** Use [Azure Backup](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/backup/) to back up the VM disks used by your Azure virtual machines. Also consider using [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery/) to protect your VMs in the event of a regional disaster.
* **Block blobs:** Turn on [soft delete](../blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete.md) to protect against object-level deletions and overwrites, or copy block blobs to another storage account in a different region using [AzCopy](storage-use-azcopy.md), [Azure PowerShell](storage-powershell-guide-full.md), or the [Azure Data Movement library](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-azure-storage-data-movement-library-preview-2/).
* **Files:** Use [AzCopy](storage-use-azcopy.md) or [Azure PowerShell](storage-powershell-guide-full.md) to copy your files to another storage account in a different region.
* **Tables:** use [AzCopy](storage-use-azcopy.md) to export table data to another storage account in a different region.

## Track outages

Customers may subscribe to the [Azure Service Health Dashboard](https://azure.microsoft.com/status/) to track the health and status of Azure Storage and other Azure services.

Microsoft also recommends that you design your application to prepare for the possibility of write failures, and to expose these in a way that alerts you to the possibility of an outage in the primary region.

## Understand the forced failover process

Customer-managed forced failover (preview) enables you to fail your entire storage account over to the secondary region if the primary becomes unavailable for any reason. When you force a failover to the secondary region, clients can immediately begin writing data to the secondary endpoint. Forced failover helps you to maintain high availability for your customers.

### How a forced failover works

Under normal circumstances, a client writes data to an Azure Storage account in the primary region, and that data is replicated asynchronously to the secondary region. The following image shows the scenario when the primary region is available:

![Clients write data to the storage account in the primary region](media/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance/primary-available.png)

If the primary region becomes unavailable for any reason, the client is no longer able to write to the storage account. The following image shows the scenario where the primary has become unavailable, but no recovery has happened yet:

![The primary is unavailable, so clients cannot write data](media/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance/primary-unavailable-before-failover.png)

The customer initiates the forced failover to the secondary region. The failover process updates the DNS entry provided by Azure Storage so that the secondary endpoint becomes the new primary endpoint for your storage account, as shown in the following image:

![Customer initiates forced failover to secondary region](media/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance/failover-to-secondary.png)

Write access is restored for GRS and RA-GRS accounts once the DNS entry has been updated and requests are being directed to the new primary region. Existing storage service endpoints for blobs, tables, queues, and files remain the same after the failover.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After the failover is complete, the storage account is configured to be locally redundant in the new primary region. To resume replication to the new secondary, configure the account to use geo-redundant storage again (either RA-GRS or GRS).
>
> Keep in mind that converting an LRS account to RA-GRS or GRS incurs a cost. This cost applies to updating the storage account in the new primary region to use RA-GRS or GRS after a failover.  

### Anticipate data loss

> [!CAUTION]
> A forced failover usually involves some data loss. It's important to understand the implications of initiating a forced failover.  

Because data is written asynchronously from the primary region to the secondary region, there is always a delay before a write to the primary region is replicated to the secondary region. If the primary region becomes unavailable, the most recent writes may not yet have been replicated to the secondary region.

When you force a failover, all data in the primary region is lost as the secondary region becomes the new primary region and the storage account is configured to be locally redundant. All data already replicated to the secondary is maintained when the failover happens. However, any data written to the primary that has not also been replicated to the secondary is lost permanently. 

The **Last Sync Time** property indicates the most recent time that data from the primary region is guaranteed to have been written to the secondary region. All data written prior to the **Last Sync Time** property is available on the secondary, while data written after the **Last Sync Time** may not have been written to the secondary and may be lost. Use this property in the event of an outage to estimate the amount of data loss you may incur by initiating a forced failover.

### Use caution when failing back

After you fail over from the primary to the secondary region, your storage account is configured to be locally redundant in the new primary region. You can configure the account for geo-redundancy again by updating it to use GRS or RA-GRS. When the account is configured for geo-redundancy again after a failover, the new primary region immediately begins replicating data to the new secondary region, which was the primary before the original failover. However, it may take a period of time before existing data in the primary is fully replicated to the new secondary.

After the storage account is reconfigured for geo-redundancy, it's possible to fail back from the new primary to the new secondary. In this case, the original primary region prior to the failover becomes the primary region again, and is configured to be locally redundant. All data in the post-failover primary region (the original secondary) is then lost. If most of the data in the storage account has not been replicated to the new secondary before you fail back, you could suffer a major data loss. 

To avoid a major data loss, check the **Last Sync Time** property before failing back.

## About the forced failover preview

Forced failover is available in preview for all customers using GRS or RA-GRS with Azure Resource Manager deployments. General-purpose v1, General-purpose v2, and Blob storage account types are supported. Forced failover is currently available in these regions:

- US West 2
- US West Central

The preview is intended for non-production use only. Production service-level agreements (SLAs) are not currently available.

### Additional considerations 

Review the additional considerations described in this section to understand how your applications and services may be affected when you force a failover during the preview period.

#### Azure virtual machine disks

Microsoft recommends converting unmanaged disks to managed disks.

Azure VM disks are stored as page blobs in Azure Storage. When a VM is running in Azure, any disks attached to the VM are leased. A forced failover cannot proceed when there is a lease on a blob. To perform the failover, follow these steps:

1. Shut down the VM.
1. Perform the forced failover.
1. Reattach the VM disks and restart your VMs in the new primary region.

Any data stored in a temporary disk is lost when the VM is shut down.

#### Azure File Sync

Azure File Sync supports forced failover. However, you will need to reconfigure all Azure File Sync settings after the failover is complete.

### Unsupported features or services

The following features or services are not supported for forced failover for the preview release:

- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 hierarchical file shares cannot be failed over.
- A storage account containing Azure managed disks for virtual machines cannot be failed over. The storage account containing managed disks is managed by Microsoft.
- A storage account containing archived blobs cannot be failed over. Maintain archived blobs in a separate storage account that you do not plan to fail over.
- A storage account containing premium block blobs cannot be failed over. Storage accounts that support premium block blobs do not currently support geo-redundancy.
- A storage account containing large (premium???) Azure File shares cannot be failed over.  

## Alternative to forced failover

If your storage account is configured for RA-GRS, then you have read access to your data in the secondary region. If you prefer not to fail over in the event of an outage in the primary region, you can use tools such as [AzCopy](storage-use-azcopy.md), [Azure PowerShell](storage-powershell-guide-full.md), or the [Azure Data Movement library](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-azure-storage-data-movement-library-preview-2/) to copy data from your storage account in the secondary region to another storage account in an unaffected region. You can then point your applications to that storage account for both read and write availability.

## Microsoft-managed failover

In extreme circumstances where a region is lost due to a significant disaster, Microsoft may initiate a regional failover. In this case, no action on your part is required. Until the Microsoft-managed failover has completed, you won't have write access to your storage account. Your applications can read from the secondary region if your storage account is configured for RA-GRS.
