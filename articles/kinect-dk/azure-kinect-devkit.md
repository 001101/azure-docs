SDK exposes BGRA mode that is converted from MJPEG on host CPU. This is not native more and causes CPU load when used.## Motion sensor (IMU)IMU is LSM6DSMUS and includes both accelerometer and gyroscope, both sampled at 1.6kHz and reported to host at 208Hz rate.## Microphone array7-Microphone circular array, this is identified as standard USB2.0 class device and works with Windows without any SDK installed.Specification:- Sensitivity: -22 dBFS (94 dB SPL, 1 kHz)- Signal to noise ratio	> 65 dB## USBAzure Kinect DK is a USB3 composite device which exposes following hardware endpoints to the operating system:Vendor ID is 0x045E (Microsoft), Product ID table below:|    USB Interface        |    PNP IP    |     Notes            ||-------------------------|--------------|----------------------||    USB3.1 Gen1 Hub    |    0x097A    |    The   main hub    ||    USB2.0 Hub         |    0x097B    |    HS   USB          ||    Depth camera          |    0x097C    |    USB3.0            ||    Color camera            |    0x097D    |    USB3.0            ||    Microphones                |    0x097E    |    HS   USB          |## IndicatorsDevice has camera streaming indicator on front of the device that is software configuration for RGB and Depth camerasStatus LED behind the device indicates device state:- Solid white indicates device is powered and operating normally- Blinking amber that device does not have sufficient power to operate (e.g. powered through USB Type A)- Blinking white that device is powered but do not have USB3 data connection## Powering DeviceDevice can be powered using inbox power supply and USB Type C to A cable or using Type-C to C cable for both power and data.Type C to C cable is not included inbox.>[!NOTE]> USB cables do matter and it is recommended to use high quality cables and verify functionality before deploying unit remotelyTips for selecting good type-C to Type-C cable:- Use USB certified cable (https://www.usb.org/products), must support both power and data- Passive cable should be less than 1.5m in length, for longer cables use active cable - The cable shall support no less than >1.5A, else you need connect external PSUVerifying cable:- Connect device with cable to host PC- Validate all devices enumerate correctly in Windows device manager. Depth and RGB camera as example below![Azure Kinect DK in Device Manager](media/AzureKinectDK-DeviceManager.png)- Validate that cable is able to stream reliably all sensors in Azure Kinect Viewer, with following settings:    - Depth camera: NFOV unbinned    - RGB Camera: 2160p    - Microphones and IMU enabled## Power consumptionUp to 5.9W, power consumption is use case dependent.## CalibrationDevice is factory calibrated and calibration data is available programmatically using Sensor SDK.## External syncronizationDevice includes 3.5mm synchronization pins that can be used to daisy chain multiple units together and have coordinated Depth/RGB camera triggering.Compatible cable is not included in box and must be purchased separately, cable requirements:- 3.5mm tip Male-to-male cable ("3.5mm audio cable")- Maximum cable length < 10m- Both stereo or mono cable are acceptable.More details on getting started with [external synchronization](external-sync.md)## Device recoveryDevice firmware can be reset to original firmware using button underneath the lock pin.![Azure Kinect DK recovery button](media/AzureKinectdk-recovery.png)To perform recovery see [instructions here](azurekinect-fw-recovery.md)## See also * [Using Sensor SDK](sensor-sdk.md) * [Host PC minimum requirement](system-requirements.md) * [Setup hardware](set-up-hardware.md)
