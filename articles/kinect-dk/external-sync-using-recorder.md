---title: Azure Kinect DK External Syncdescription: Using external synchronization for coordinated triggeringauthor: joylitalms.author: joylitalms.date: 2/6/2019keywords: Kinect, sensor, viewer, external sync, phase delay, depth, RGB, camera, audio cable, recorder---# Azure Kinect DK External Synchronization (Preview)Multiple Azure Kinect DK devices can be daisy-chained together using [3.5mm audio cable](azure-kinect-devkit.md#external-syncronization) to enable synchronized triggering.This page explains how to setup and create recording using [Azure Kinect recorder](k4a-recordplayback.md).## Requirements- Azure Kinect DK units (2+)- [3.5mm audio cable](azure-kinect-devkit.md#external-syncronization) for synchronization (not included inbox)- Host PC for each device (or dedicated host controller depending on use case and amount of data transferred over USB)- Master device has to stream RGB camera that is handling the synchronization## Setting up system1. Connect all the units to power and to host PC2. Connect synchronization cable between the units    - Master SYNC OUT to subordinate SYNC IN      - Subordinate-1 SYNC OUT to Subordinate-2 SYNC IN    - etc.![External sync setup](media/azurekinectdk-extsync.png)## Recording using Azure Kinect Recorder (k4arecorder.exe)Recommendation is to use the same framerate and resolution for all cameras. Start subordinate devices first and master last.### Subordinate-1- Setup recorder for the first unit```>k4arecorder.exe --external-sync subordinate -l 10 sub1.mkv```- Device starts waiting ```Device serial number: 000011590212Device version: Rel; C: 1.5.78; D: 1.5.60[6109.6109]; A: 1.5.13Device started[subordinate mode] Waiting for signal from master```### Subordinate-2- Setup recorder for the second unit```>k4arecorder.exe --external-sync subordinate -l 10 sub2.mkv```- Device starts waiting ```Device serial number: 000011590212Device version: Rel; C: 1.5.78; D: 1.5.60[6109.6109]; A: 1.5.13Device started[subordinate mode] Waiting for signal from master```### Master- Start recording on master:```>k4arecorder.exe --external-sync master -l 10 master.mkv```- Wait until recording finished## Playing recordingYou can use [Azure Kinect viewer](k4a-viewer.md) to playback recording or other solutions as listed [here](k4a-recordplayback.md#verifying-recording).## Known limitations and tips- Master has to be started last as to align timestamps across all devices- Master device has to stream RGB camera- External sync signal is not delayed, any delay configuration is handling internally in device and is driven by RGB camera- Restarting subordinate device will cause synchronization to be lost- Some [camera modes](azure-kinect-devkit.md) support 15fps max. It is not recommended to mix modes/framerates between devices- Connecting multiple units to single PC can easily saturate USB bandwidth, consider using separate host PC per device- Disable microphone and IMU in viewer if those are not needed, this can improve reliabilityFor any issues see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
