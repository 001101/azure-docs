# Quickstart: Set up Azure Kinect DK

This page provides guidance about how to set up your Azure Kinect hardware, test sensor stream visualization, and use the Azure Kinect Viewer.

## System requirements

Check [System requirements](system-requirements.md) to verify that your host PC configuration meets all Azure Kinect DK minimum requirements.

## Set up hardware

1. Connect the power cable to your device and plug the power supply into a wall outlet or power strip.
2. Connect the USB data cable into your device and PC.
   >[!NOTE]
   >Use connectors from the PC to the the back of device, as they work better than connectors  such as a dongle.

3. Verify the power indicator LED next to the USB cable is solid white.
4. Device power on takes a few seconds and is ready to use when the front-facing LED streaming indicator turns off.

## Download the SDK

1. Select the link to [Download the SDK](sensor-sdk-download.md).
2. Install the SDK on your PC.

## Verify device streams data

1. Launch `k4aviewer.exe` located under the installed tools directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Azure Kinect SDK\tools\k4aviewer.exe`). You can launch it from either the command line or by double-clicking the executable. Azure Kinect Viewer is also available as a link in the start menu.
2. Select **Open Device**, then **Start**.
