Connect power cable to device and power supply to wall outlet2. Connect USB data cable to device and to PC (Note! Using connectors close to PC motherboard, e.g. back of the device can work better than ones on top of PC)3. Verify that status LED next to USB cable is solid white4. Device power on takes few seconds and it is ready to use when streaming indicator LED on front turns off![AzureKinect DK connected](media/azurekinectdk-connected2.png)## Download SDK5. Download SDK 6. Unzip SDK on your PC## Verify device streams data7. Launch ```K4A Viewer.exe``` located under tools -directory (e.g. ```\tools\amd64\release\K4AViewer.exe```). You can launch it both command line or by double-clicking the executable.8. For Windows Defender warning, click ***more info*** and ***Run anyway*** to application launched![Windows Defender notice](media/windows-defender-notice.png)9. Select Open Device and then Start    ![Viewer Configuration](media/AzureKinectViewer-Configuration.png)10. Verify that all device sensors stream data (Depth, RGB, IMU and microphones) and that get visualized in tool    ![K4AViewer Screenshot](media/k4aViewer-ExampleScreenshot.png)11. **Done!**Your setup is now working correctly and you are good to start developing your application or integrating services.See [here](index.md) what you can do next! >[!TIP]>If not already done, reminder to [update to latest device firmware](AzureKinect-FW-Update.md) before starting a project If you have any issues, check [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)## Next steps* See [code samples](https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Analog/_git/analog.ai.depthcamera?path=%2Fsdk%2Fexamples&version=GBdevelop) and develop your first application (**Coming later!**)* Try [recording sensor stream to file](k4a-recordplayback.md) and open up with video player## See also* [Azure Kinect Homepage](index.md)* [Azure Kinect DK hardware information](azure-kinect-devkit.md)* Learn more about [Kinect for Azure viewer](k4a-viewer.md)* [Update device firmware](AzureKinect-FW-Update.md)
