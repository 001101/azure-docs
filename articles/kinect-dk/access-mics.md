# Access microphones

The Speech SDK Quickstarts provide examples to utilize the Azure Kinect DK microphone array in a variety of programming languages.
For example, view Quickstart: Recognize speech in C++ on Windows by using the Speech SDK; the code is available [from GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/cpp-windows).

Access the microphone array also through Windows API, and see the following docs for details on Windows documentation:

* [Windows Audio architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/windows-audio-architecture)
* [Windows.Media.Capture documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Capture)
* [Tutorial for webcam capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/basic-photo-video-and-audio-capture-with-mediacapture)
* [USB audio information](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/usb-2-0-audio-drivers)

## Next steps

* Speech Services SDK
* Set Up Microphone in Azure Kinect DK
* Azure Kinect Viewer as Sample Code
