How the device is positioned and application is used can affect on how users perceive its reliability and usability.## What does the sensors seeSee below image Depth and RGB camera FOV and what sensors "see". Note that diagram is illustrative where RGB camera is in 4:3 mode.![Camera FOV](media/azurekinectdk-camerafov.png)Camera FOV front from 2000mm distance visualized below. Notice that 4:3 resolution mode has better overlap of pixel in NFOV mode (hexagon shape) than 16:9 has. ![Camera FOV Front](media/azurekinectdk-fov-front.png)Depending on space that need to be imaged you may use depth camera narrow and wide field of field operating modes to cover the space.![Using depth camera narrow vs. wide field of view modes for imaging space](media/AzureKinectDK-positioning-nfov-wfov.png)## What does the microphones hearMicrophones are located on top of the device.![Microphone bubble](media/azurekinectdk-micbubble.png)## Motion sensingMotion sensor can be used to detect gravity direction for example to flip images if sensor is mounted upside down. ## MountingDevice has tripod thread (1/4-20 UNC thread mounting point) and 4 x M2.5x4mm screw holes in sides of the device for mounting. Using the tripod mount is the recommended way to mount the device.When using side mounting, use all 4 screws to securely attach the device.Remember to take into consideration [device operational conditions](Azure-kinect-devkit.md#operating-environment) when mounting device. ![Mounting using tripod thread](media/azurekinectdk-mounting.png)## Positioning tips- Device placed close to surface (e.g. directly on top of table) may cause reflection that impacts depth camera visibility. - Vibrations may impact sensor data stream quality. - Consider sunlight and different times of day to ensure consistent performance all times of the day- For noisy environments consider placing device so that it is closer to users.- When mounting close to ceiling you can mount the device upside down for better microphone array performance## Multipath interferenceAzure Kinect DK Depth camera works on the phase Time-of-Flight principle (AMCW lidar), where the distance is determined by measuring the phase delay in modulated illumination. This is the same technique used by Kinect for Windows 2.0. When signals from different distances are combined they can result in systematic biases in range measurements of the intended target. This most commonly occurs when glossy or specular objects are present in the scene, particularly at high angles of incidence. For example, placing Azure Kinect DK directly on top of a highly reflective/glossy table, such that the field of illumination intersects the table, can result in perturbed range measurements if objects sitting on or beyond the table receive the combined direct illumination from the depth sensor and the indirect illumination from the table. Typically this results in overestimation of range to an object.In many situations the degradation in ranging quality is minor or imperceivable. Changing the scene layout or composition so as to reduce the reflected signal intensity from the aggressor object is typically the best mitigation if required. In the case of a device placed on a table, this may entail translating the device to the edge of the table or tilting it upwards so that the field-of-illumination does not intersect the table.Some light diffusion can occur within objects (e.g. red Lego blocks), resulting in biased range measurements. Multipath interference can also occur at the edges of objects, where a single imaging pixel integrates light from different distances. Imaging scenes with extremely high dynamic range can result in blooming, where bright foreground objects bias or invalidate dark background objects.## Interference with infrared based devicesAzure Kinect DK Depth camera illumination may cause interference to other infrared based devices like TV remote controls. The degree of interference will depend on the wavelength of light used by the remote control, the robustness of the receiver, the mode of operation of the depth sensor and the relative position of the devices within the scene. If interference occurs, we advise repositioning the receiver such that it is outside the field-of-illumination of the depth camera>[!TIP]>Use Azure Kinect viewer to experiment what sensors see
