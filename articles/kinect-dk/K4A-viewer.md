Please check/update the tool regularly to take benefit of added functionality.## Using viewer### SetupYou need following binaries to run the application:```- K4Aviewer.exe - k4a.dll - DepthEngine.dll - libusb-1.0.dll```Connect Azure Kinect DK with host PC using supplied USB cable and power to wall outlet.### Start application1. Launch the application by running K4AViewer.exe2. Select open, if device is not visible click refresh 3. Click Start Using default setting should get all sensors streaming, move around windows if necessary to see all of them.## Checking device firmare versionDevice Firmware Version can be accessed in configuration window, see below image![Checking device firmware version using viewer](media/AzureKinectViewer-FWversion.png)For example in this case Depth Camera ISP is running FW 1.4.40.## Depth CameraThe depth camera viewer will show two windows - one called "Active Brightness", which will have a greyscaleimage showing IR brightness and another called "Depth", which has a colorized representation of the depth data.Hovering over the Depth window will show the value of the depth sensor at the pixel under your cursor.Average frame rate from the depth camera over the last two seconds is also shown.Note that this frame rate is constrained by the app frame rate, so if the app is struggling to maintain framerate, this may under report the sensor framerate.![Depth view](media/K4AViewer-Depth.png)## RGB CameraColor camera view![RGB view](media/K4AViewer-RGB.png)You can control RGB camera settings from the configuration window during the streaming![RGB camera controls](media/azurekinectviewer-rgbcontrols.png)## Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)The IMU window has two components - an accelerometer and a gyroscope.The top half is the accelerometer and shows linear acceleration in meters/second^2.  It includes accelerationfrom gravity, so if it's lying flat on a table the Z axis will probably show around -9.8m/s^2.The bottom half is the gyrsocope portion and shows rotational movement in radians/second![Motion sensor view](media/AzureKinectViewer-IMU.png)## Microphone inputThe microphone view shows a representation of the sound heard on each microphone.  If there's no sound, the graphwill be empty.  If there is sound, you'll see a dark blue waveform with a (usually smaller) light blue waveformoverlaid on top of it.The dark wave represents the minimum and maximum values observed by the microphone over that time slice.  The lightwave represents the root mean square of the values observed by the microphone over that time slice.![Microphone input view](media/K4AViewer-Mic.png)## Point cloud visualisationDepth visualized in 3D![Depth point cloud](media/azurekinectviewer-depthpointcloud.png)you can move in the image using instructed keys. Currently point cloud is fixed to single resolution and window is not resiable, this as well as RGB point cloud support is under development.## External synchronization controlYou can use viewer to set device as standalone (default), master or subordinate mode when configuring multi-device synchronization.When changing configuration or inserting/removing synchronization cable, click refresh to update.![External synchronization control](media/azurekinectviewer-extsync.png)See also [External synchronization setup guide](external-sync.md)## Playing back recordingThis is not supported yet. See [recording quickstart](k4a-recordplayback.md) on how to use available players to playback recording.## Known issues/troubleshooting* Opening multiple color cameras at once isn't supported yet and may hang/crash.* Showing microphone data with multiple devices connected at once isn't supported yet and may show data from the wrong microphone.* There are performance problems when running the RGB camera in 4K mode* The UI is rudimentary/subject to overhaul.  It doesn't currently place/size windows in a way that shows all information (there's some stacking), and this is exacerbated when using high camera resolutions (framerate info can get obscured).* Due to an API limitation, you can't refresh the device list while any device windows are open.* Unexpected device disconnects are not handled properly yet and can cause hangs/crashes.See also [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
