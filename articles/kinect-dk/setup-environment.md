# Environmental Considerations

- Azure Kinect DK is designed to work reliably on following operational device environment:
    - Indoor use
    - Ambient temperature 0-35 C
    - Humidity (non-condensing) 8-90 %RH
    - Ambient light level 10-2500 Lux

- Depth camera performance is dependent on target reflectivity
