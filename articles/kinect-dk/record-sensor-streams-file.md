# Quickstart: Record sensor streams to file

This quickstart provides information about how you can use the `k4arecorder` command prompt tool to record data streams from the Sensor SDK to a file.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

This quickstart assumes:

* You have the Azure Kinect DK connected to your host PC and powered properly.
* You have finished [setting up](set-up-azure-kinect-dk.md) the hardware.

## Create recording

1. Open a command prompt, and navigate to the recorder location or path, such as `C:\Program Files\Azure Kinect SDK\tools\amd64\release\k4arecorder.exe`.
2. Record 5 seconds using these default settings (*Depth NFOV unbinned and RGB 1080p at 30 fps with IMU*).

    `k4arecorder.exe -l 5 %TEMP%\output.mkv`

3. For a complete overview of recording options and tips, refer to [Azure Kinect recorder](azure-kinect-dk-recorder.md).

## Play back recording

You can use the [Azure Kinect viewer](azure-kinect-sensor-viewer.md) to play back a recording.

1. Launch [`k4aviewer.exe`](azure-kinect-sensor-viewer.md)
2. Unfold the **Open Recording** tab and open your recording.
