# k4a_image_release function

Remove a reference from the 
[k4a_image_t](~/api/0.6.0/k4a-image-t.md)
. 

## Syntax

```C
void k4a_image_release(
    k4a_image_t image_handle
)
```
## Parameters

[`k4a_image_t`](~/api/0.6.0/k4a-image-t.md) `image_handle`

Handle of the image for which the get operation is performed on.

## Remarks
References manage the lifetime of the object. When the references reach zero the object is destroyed. Caller should assume this function frees the object, as a result the object should not be accessed after this call completes.
