# k4a_capture_get_image_timestamp_usec function

Get the timestamp of the capture. 

## Syntax

```C
uint64_t k4a_capture_get_image_timestamp_usec(
    k4a_capture_t capture_handle,
    k4a_image_format_t format
)
```
## Parameters

[`k4a_capture_t`](~/api/0.2.0/k4a-capture-t.md) `capture_handle`

Handle to a capture returned by 
[k4a_device_get_capture()](~/api/0.2.0/k4a-device-get-capture.md)

[`k4a_image_format_t`](~/api/0.2.0/k4a-image-format-t.md) `format`

The image format type the caller wants to access

## Remarks
Returns the timestamp of the capture. Timestamps are recorded by the device and represent the mid-point of exposure. They may be used for relative comparison, but their absolute value has no defined meaning.

## Return Value
`uint64_t`

Timestamp in microseconds, 0 if image format is not supported by the given capture.
