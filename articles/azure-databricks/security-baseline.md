# Azure Security Baseline for Azure Databricks

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Databricks contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2809).

**Guidance**: Deploy Azure Databricks in your own Azure virtual network (VNet). The default deployment of Azure Databricks is a fully managed service on Azure: all data plane resources, including a VNet that all clusters will be associated with, are deployed to a locked resource group. If you require network customization, however, you can deploy Azure Databricks data plane resources in your own virtual network (sometimes called VNet injection), enabling you to implement custom network configurations, such as applying your own Network Security Group with custom rules to specify egress traffic restrictions.

Additionally, you may configure network security group (NSG) rules to specify egress traffic restrictions on the subnet that your Azure Databricks instance is deployed to.

How to deploy Azure Databricks into your own Virtual Network: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/vnet-inject

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICS

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2810).

**Guidance**: Deploy Azure Databricks in your own Azure virtual network (VNet); this will automatically create a network security group (NSG) with rules configured that are required for the functionality of your Azure Data Bricks implementation. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into a storage account for traffic audit. You may also send flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2814).

**Guidance**: Implement an IDP/IPS capable network virtual appliance (NVA) from the Azure Marketplace to create a virtual network integrated workspace in which all Azure Databricks clusters have a single IP outbound address. The single IP address can be used as an additional security layer with other Azure services and applications that allow access based on specific IP addresses.

If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall with Threat Intelligence can be used. Azure Firewall Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic to and from known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.

**Guidance**: Use Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups that are attached to the Subnets your Azure Databricks instance is associated with. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

**Guidance**: An Azure Databricks workspace comprises a management plane that is hosted in an Azure Databricks managed virtual network and a data plane that is deployed in a customer-managed virtual network. The control plane stores all users’ notebooks and associated notebook results in a database. By default, all notebooks and results are encrypted at rest with a different encryption key.

If your security and compliance requirements mean that you must own and manage the key used for encrypting your notebooks and results yourself, you can use the instructions in this article to provide your own key for encrypting all data in the Azure Databricks hosted control plane.

Databricks File System (DBFS) is a distributed file system mounted into an Azure Databricks workspace and available on Azure Databricks clusters. DBFS is implemented as a Storage Account in your Azure Databricks workspace’s managed resource group. By default, the storage account is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys.

With customer-managed keys (CMK) for default (root) DBFS, you can use your own encryption key to encrypt the DBFS storage account.

Note: These features are not available for all Azure Databricks subscriptions. Contact your Microsoft or Databricks account representative to request access.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2891).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2896).

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systems’ incident response capabilities on a regular cadence. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications &nbsp;for security incidents

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2892).

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that the customer data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party.  Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.
