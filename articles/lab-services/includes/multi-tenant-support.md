If you are an admin or a lab owner who is part of multiple Azure AD tenants, you can navigate between tenants from the Azure Lab Services portal (the top-right corner). 

![Pick a tenant](../media/multi-tenant-support/picker.png)

Once you pick a tenant, select from a list of lab accounts within your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant in the top-right corner. 

Lab users only see a single list of the virtual machines that they have access to inside the selected Azure Lab Services.
