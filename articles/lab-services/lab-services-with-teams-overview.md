# Azure Lab Services with Microsoft Teams

Azure Lab Services owners/creators are now able to create labs within Microsoft Teams.

This article outlines the benefits of Teams integration and provides links to other articles for instructions on how to manage the Azure Lab Services with Teams integration. 

## Benefits

Azure Lab Services integration with Microsoft Teams will help educators set up a classroom environment and provide virtual lab environments within the team(class) 

* Educators will be able to set up labs and students can access their VM’s from within Teams, without having to navigate to https://labs.azure.com. 
* Single Sign-on (SSO) from Teams to Azure Lab Services.
* Team and Lab owners need not maintain class rosters in two different systems - Lab user list is auto-populated from the Team membership and a sync is performed every 24 hours automatically. 
* After the initial publish of the Template VM, Lab Capacity (i.e. number of VM’s in the lab) would be automatically adjusted based on the addition/deletion of users from the Team membership. 
* Team and Lab Owners will view only the labs related to the team and students will view only the VM’s which are provisioned for the specific team. 
* Users will be auto registered to the lab and VM’s will be automatically assigned upon the first login after the lab is published. Educators need not send invitations and students need not register for the lab separately.
