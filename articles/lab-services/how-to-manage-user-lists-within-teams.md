# Manage Lab Services user lists from Teams

When a lab is created within Teams (see [Get started and create a Lab Services lab from Teams](how-to-get-started-create-lab-within-teams.md)), the lab user list is automatically populated and synced with the team membership. Everyone on the team, including Owners, Members and Guests will be automatically added to the lab user list. Azure lab Services will maintain a sync with the team membership and an automatic sync is triggered every 24 hours. Educators can always use the ‘Sync’ button to trigger a manual sync once the team membership is updated.
