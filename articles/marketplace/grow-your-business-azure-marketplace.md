# Grow your business with the Azure Marketplace

After you have developed the technical assets for your Azure Marketplace listing, you can increase the number of users coming to your app and the growth in usage of your product by following marketing best practices. 

>[!NOTE]
>To learn about the publishing process and technical requirements, please read the [Azure Marketplace and AppSource publishing guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/marketplace-publishers-guide).

## How marketing helps

Following best practices in marketing will help set you up for success with go-to-market and Microsoft Co-Sell initiatives. It will also maximize your business benefits through the Marketplace. The [Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership) is your gateway for all marketing and programmatic resources that aren't related to the Marketplace. 

The quality of your app publication and your commitment to customer-centric demand generation and partner engagement help drive customer growth for your business. Engaging in these activities helps Microsoft amplify go-to-market work and feature key solutions across the Marketplace storefronts. 

This section walks you through marketing best practices for an offer, according to the following checklist:

- I've optimized my listing to drive traffic and engagement.
- I've created messaging on my website, leveraging a unique landing page, to drive traffic to my Marketplace listing.
- I've published a test drive or other trial so that customers can experience my offer running live on Azure.
- I've planned and built my own marketing and promotion campaigns to drive awareness and engagement.
- I've enabled on-demand lead generation so that every time someone acts to test or deploy my application, I receive their name and contact information.
- I've learned about and connected with the partner resources that are available to me through the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership).

### Create a great listing

Your listing in the Marketplace can sometimes be your first interaction with a potential customer. Like any first impression, you want to make it strong and something your audience wants to follow up on. There are some basic things you can do to help make this first impression in the Marketplace great!

- **Be found:** Write your offer description by using key words and terms that your buyer will search for. 
- **Be visual:** Images and videos help show users your key features and can help illustrate your experience. Think about what you can show that helps deliver your value proposition or answer your buyer's top questions.
- **Provide an experience:** Customers like to try before they buy. Leads generated from demos, trials, and test drives result in more customer deals. The stronger the trial experience you can provide, the stronger the lead you'll generate. We've found that test drive leads result (on average) in 40 percent closed deals.
- **Help your audience learn:** Though we encourage you to keep your overview space clear and simple, there's also plenty of room to point to additional resources about your product. Use this space to deliver the concise message about what your product does and how it's a fit for your customer's needs. Don't be afraid to direct them to additional materials to learn more. It's a bonus if these learning materials or links can track into your content marketing strategy, so you can be consistently nurturing leads.
- **Take advantage of ratings and reviews:** Let your customers sell your product for you. Customer advocacy can be the biggest driver of sales and is often where buyers go before they learn more about your product. Having multiple strong reviews also helps bump up your offer in search results and into key featured areas.

### Build a great landing page
A landing page on your company website is a gateway from your demand generation activities to your listing in the Azure Marketplace. 

Begin by identifying your goals. For your Marketplace solutions, decide who your target customer is and what action you want them to take. Sample actions would be "Test drive our solution" or "Get a solution now." Your landing page can be used across multiple marketing tactics--anything from events, webcasts, and social media to whitepapers, technical training sessions, and press releases. The more consistent you are in your messaging and call to action, the easier your solution will be to find.

When you have a campaign plan ready, follow these best practices and consider what to avoid to maximize the effectiveness of your landing page: 


|Best practice  |What to avoid  |
|---------|---------|
|**Articulate what customer problem your solution solves, and how you use Azure to make it happen**    |  Failing to articulate the ways in which your solution plus Azure work together       |
|**Create a short, easy-to-remember URL**    |    Using long URLs that aren't memorable and are hard to locate     |
|**Add relevant visual content: a customer testimonial video or solution architecture are best practices**   |   Using too much text, which can make your audience tune out and stop exploring with you      |
|**Create a clear call to action to direct visitors to your Marketplace catalog page**    |   Having too many links or possible actions on the page       |
|**Put your call to action in a header or clearly delineated section**    |  Embedding the links to your Marketplace listing in a paragraph of text       |
|**Research best keywords and optimize the page for search**    | Assuming that your product name generates higher search rankings        |
|**Leverage keywords from your advertising campaigns**    |  Using many different keywords across your web properties, which will dilute your advertising investments       |
|**Put relevant product names and keywords 'above the fold'**     | Making users scroll to see what product or solution you are showcasing        |
|**Use brand imagery (such as Azure Certified) to validate your solution, and in accordance with Microsoft branding guidelines**    |    Using unapproved Microsoft brand imagery     |

### Promote your new offer

#### Build an effective marketing campaign
A marketing campaign is a series of promotional activities or marketing tactics aimed at driving your audience to a desired action or outcome. Before you design your campaign, you should do the following.

##### Know your audience

First, verify who is the buyer and who is the influencer. Your tactics and calls to action for each group might differ. Ask these evaluation questions:

- How much control does the buyer have over the purchasing decision? 
- How much influence does the influencer have? 
- What does the influencer influence? 
- Do they influence budget or which solution is picked? 

Knowing the answers to these questions will help you make decisions about where to invest your dollars and how to distribute your dollars.

##### Define where your audience Learns

Buyers are 90 percent of the way through their journey by the time they visit a marketplace. Buyers get this far along in the decision-making process by learning about solutions and assessing options in advance. You want to design a campaign that aims to be where your buyers and influencers learn. 

Every audience for each industry, vertical, or category is different. Does your audience learn online, through email, at trade shows, through social media, or through conversations with trusted advisors? Depending on where and how your audience learns, you'll want to design activities and distribute your marketing dollars accordingly. The combination of these tactics becomes your campaign strategy.

#### Create clear campaign goals

You'll need to define success for your Marketplace campaign and create clear KPIs. You might run multiple campaigns with different end goals. We all want to grow sales. The ultimate end goal is increased revenue or customer acquisition. However, your marketing campaigns might be tied to goals at other stages of the buying cycle.

For instance, if you have newly launched your product in the Marketplace, you might find your focus is best spent on audience education and lead generation. Success might be defined by the number of leads generated from your Marketplace listing. In this case, your marketing tactics (and landing page) would focus on drawing customers to your Marketplace listing.

If you have a trial set up in the Marketplace and you know that your product requires some level of engagement and experience before purchase, you might make your campaign goal the number of trials downloaded. In this case, the CTA for your campaign tactics would focus sharply on encouraging a trial in the Marketplace. 

If your product or category is more well-known and you have purchase capabilities set up in the Marketplace, you might decide to skip the trial step and direct your audience directly to your "buy now" link in the Marketplace.

At a more mature point in your offer's history, you might decide to focus your campaign efforts on upselling your customer base and drive action toward increased purchase in the Marketplace. Your tactics would focus on encouraging customers to "buy now" in the Marketplace. Your KPI might be the revenue generated through the Marketplace.

Whatever your offer's maturity and the goals of your organization, staying focused on this goal and mapping out a set of integrated marketing tactics aligned to this goal are key to maximizing your campaign effectiveness.

As part of being a new publisher in the Azure Marketplace, we'll offer you some free Marketplace GTM benefits. You should think critically about how to use these benefits in your campaign strategy. Let our marketing team know your Marketplace campaign goals and your desired audience action. We can customize these deliverables to work into your plan.

For additional go-to-market support--including templates, web content, training, and tools to promote your business--visit [Microsoft Go To Market](https://www.MicrosoftGoToMarket.com). For additional content on campaign building and marketing best practices, visit [Smart Partner Marketing](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/smart-partner-marketing), a program of the Microsoft Partner Network.

#### Take advantage of Marketplace GTM benefits

New listings in the Marketplace become eligible to receive free Marketplace GTM benefits. Our team of marketing specialists will reach out to you to kick-start these activities. There is nothing for you to do except to engage with us when we reach out. 

The activities we provide differ depending on your solution status in the Marketplace. Benefits significantly increase for offers that come with a trial experience or transact capabilities within the Marketplace.

To maximize the impact of these activities, we encourage you to have your launch plan ready to execute. You might want to use your landing page for many of these tactics.

#### Enable lead sharing

Ensure that lead management is enabled in your Marketplace offer so that you receive the contact information of your Marketplace customers. These leads provide the basis for outreach for demand generation campaigns, sales motions by your field sales staff, and information about how your offer is performing. 

Best practices for using these leads include:

- Qualify the leads and score them as sales opportunities.
- Nurture them to enter a sales pipeline.
- Align these efforts with your overall marketing campaign strategy.

These leads demonstrate targeted user interest in your Marketplace offer and in your technology. So you should treat them as a way to find potentially highly engaged customers. When a lead is created in the Marketplace, a similar lead is created in the Microsoft field seller CRM. 

However, Marketplace leads are different from Microsoft seller-qualified leads that are a feature of the Co-Sell program. The next section describes how to access the Co-Sell program. 

#### Promote your business through Microsoft

There are many people and teams within Microsoft whose sole goal is to support our partners and reduce any friction you have in selling with us. Now that you've listed in the Marketplace, you've opened access to its programs and resources. 

If you haven't already signed up to the [Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)](https://partner.microsoft.com), this should be your first step. MPN offers guidance on topics like these:
- New business opportunities.
- Connecting with teams or partners.
- Solutions and training to help grow your skill set.

The best next steps that you can take to open access to even more partner benefits and resources are:

1.	Use your [core benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/membership/core-benefits).
    As part of our Microsoft Partner Network, you receive a set of core benefits that can help you save time and money. They can also help you strengthen your capabilities, better serve customers, and build connections to reach your full business potential.

2.	Earn your [Cloud Platform competency](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/cloud-platform-competency).
    Earning a competency helps you differentiate yourself within Microsoft's expansive partner network as well as demonstrate technical expertise and customer success in the market. Earning a competency is also a prerequisite for many key partner programs like Co-Sell.

3.	Become [Co-Sell ready](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/reach-customers/promote-your-business).
    This program allows you to collaborate directly with Microsoft sellers and other partners on target customer opportunities and account planning. Your solution becomes visible to our sellers in their solution catalog. Our sellers are rewarded for collaborating and winning with you.

#### Invest in merchandising 
As part of the publishing process, you considered what type of offer to create and had the opportunity to choose a category for your offer in the Azure Marketplace. Make sure you select a category that is accurate for your solution so that it appears accurately to potential customers. 

In the Azure Marketplace, you become eligible for featured apps when you enable Trial and Transact functionality. To understand how featured apps fit in the context of your go-to-market benefits, review the Marketplace GTM benefits. 

Featured apps are chosen based on which apps provide the best customer experience for a user and take advantage of high-quality partner marketing engagement. The criteria include:

- Clarity of the listing.
- Reliability of the technology.
- Growth of customers' platform usage.
- Your level of engagement with creating high-quality marketing material. 

To maximize your app's chances of being featured, you should invest in the success of your Marketplace offering. Consider the following approaches to ensure a great customer experience for your offer: 

- Ensure your marketing artifacts are uploaded and displaying correctly
- Join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership) and engage with the partner ecosystem.
- Drive high-quality traffic to your offer in Azure Marketplace by creating high-quality demand generation campaigns.
- Ensure that all your Azure solutions and apps are available in the Azure Marketplace.
- Grow the consumption of your Azure Marketplace offers by driving demand, providing high-quality customer service, and providing timely updates on your product.

## Analytics and reporting

In the **Insights** section of the Cloud Partner Portal, you see a high-level overview of your offer's performance. The reports included in this section are:  
- Summary snapshot of orders
- Usage
- Deployments
- Customer trends on the Insights home page
- Detailed orders, usage, and customer data
- Orders and usage shown as a monthly summary or as a six-month trend view
- Usage/orders sliced by several criteria

Detailed reports show customer information, like company name and geographic location down to the postal code, so you can compare your customers and compensate your sellers. We provide the following specific attributes about your customers:
- Reseller
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Company Name
- Transaction Date
- Subscription Name
- Azure Subscription ID (PAYG customers only)

New features for this dashboard are being rolled out in an ongoing way. Also within the Cloud Partner Portal is documentation on Microsoft Campaigns, a mechanism by which you can set up campaigns and track them in the portal.
