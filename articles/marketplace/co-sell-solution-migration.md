# Migration of co-sell solutions from OCP GTM to the commercial marketplace

## Why is Microsoft moving the publishing experience from OCP GTM to Partner Center?

The commercial marketplace within Partner Center provides simplified offer publishing to co-sell through Microsoft's three channels by centralizing offer creation and management in Partner Center, where a partner is already managing their relationship with Microsoft.

As a Microsoft partner enrolled in the commercial marketplace, you can:

- Publish your offers centrally and co-sell across Microsoft direct customer, partner, and seller channels.
- Ensure your offers are in the correct online store—[Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) or [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com)—to reach the millions of cloud customers who align with your offer capabilities.
- Drive your own publishing experience to co-sell with the offers that align with your business goals.
- Align your offer publishing within Partner Center, where you are already managing your Microsoft relationship and co-sell opportunities.
- Unlock Marketplace Rewards.

## Process updates for participating in co-sell

For your solution to be discoverable to Microsoft sellers and partners, it must meet the [co-sell ready requirements](marketplace-co-sell.md). For a Microsoft seller to be incentivized, your solution must meet the [incentive-eligible requirements](marketplace-co-sell.md). Complete these requirements on the co-sell tab in the commercial marketplace.

## Continue co-selling with Microsoft

To continue co-selling with Microsoft, make sure you have an active Microsoft Partner Network membership and are enrolled in the commercial marketplace in Partner Center.

- If you are not a partner in the Microsoft Partner Network, join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) at no cost. As a partner, you'll have access to exclusive resources, programs, tools, and connections to grow your business.
- If you do not have an account in commercial marketplace, [enroll now](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account) to continue co-selling with Microsoft and access the full publishing experience.

After you've enrolled in the commercial marketplace, prepare to merge your solutions from OCP GTM into the commercial marketplace.

First, review them in OCP GTM. You should have received an email with a link unique to your OCP GTM experience. Then follow these steps to publish your offers.

1. Visit your company's [publisher list](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpartner.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdashboard%2Faccount%2Fv3%2Fpublishers%2Flist&data=02%7C01%7Cmasmc%40microsoft.com%7Ccb7d81a3709d4ed7309f08d858d2d0f0%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637357009757504832&sdata=Mepi6O54TN3%2FbkLVWFGU%2B7dSlxkhvTIIdCJ4DDTUtN0%3D&reserved=0). It includes the account owner, managers and developers who have publishing access. Learn more about [Partner Center user roles](/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/manage-account#define-user-roles-and-permissions).
2. Ask one of the listed contacts to [add users](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpartner.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdashboard%2Faccount%2Fusermanagement&data=02%7C01%7Cmasmc%40microsoft.com%7Ccb7d81a3709d4ed7309f08d858d2d0f0%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637357009757504832&sdata=Qd4CPaQdpWAb8xmvbwig0GFQkTh5ihVJ8nIrVgLwtcs%3D&reserved=0) to the commercial marketplace as *managers* or *developers*.
3. Work with your developers to move your solutions from your OCP GTM account to the commercial marketplace.

## Migrate your solutions from OCP GTM to commercial marketplace

1. Begin the migration by signing into [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/migration).
2. Check the **Overview** page to review information about your solution migrations.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/migration-overview.png" alt-text="Partner Center Overview page, Summary tab.":::

3. To begin migration of your solutions, select the **Solutions** tab, which lets you view all the solutions associated to your MPN IDs.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/solutions-tab.png" alt-text="Partner Center Overview page, Solutions tab.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > This tab will note if there aren't any solutions pending to migrate to the commercial marketplace. To continue co-selling with Microsoft, ensure the migrated solutions are published in the commercial marketplace.

    Learn more about the solution status by reviewing the tool tips. All solutions pending action are listed under **Action Required**.<a name="beginmigration"></a>

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/migration-options.png" alt-text="The three options for migration.":::

### This is similar to an existing offer in commercial marketplace

Select this option when you may already have an offer published in the commercial marketplace that is the same as a solution published to OCP GTM. This avoids creating duplicate offers.

1. Select **This is similar to an existing offer in commercial marketplace** (see **Begin your migration** image [above](#beginmigration)). You will see live commercial marketplace offers that your OCP GTM solution can be associated with. Select the live offer from the list or enter the marketplace URL.
<!--:::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/migration-similar.png" alt-text="The first type of migration options, This is similar to an existing offer in commercial marketplace.":::-->
2. Select **Continue** to be redirected to Support to submit a migration request ticket. The indicated OCP GTM solution metadata will be merged into the selected commercial marketplace offer.
3. On the Step 1 tab, either enter the URL or select the offer, then select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/migration-step-1.png" alt-text="Information to add in step 1.":::

4. On the Step 2 tab, select **Save & contact support**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/migration-step-2.png" alt-text="The button to save and contact support.":::

### This offer will be new to commercial marketplace

Select this option when you may have an OCP GTM solution that does not yet have a corresponding offer published to the commercial marketplace. You will need to publish this solution to the commercial marketplace to continue co-selling with Microsoft, and migrating this solution will save you time by retaining Microsoft seller-facing metadata. This option requires you to select an offer type.

1. Select **This offer will be new to commercial marketplace** (see **Begin your migration** image [above](#beginmigration)), then **Continue**.
<!--:::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/migration-new.png" alt-text="The second type of migration options, This offer will be new to commercial marketplace.":::-->
2. On the Step 1 tab, select your offer type, then **Continue**.

3. On the Step 2 tab, select the publisher profile you want to host this offer on in the commercial marketplace in Partner Center and select **Create Offer**. If you do not have a publisher account, go to Partner Center to set up one and then select the publisher account.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/migration-new-step-2.png" alt-text="Select the publisher account.":::

Your offer will be migrated into the commercial marketplace in Partner Center as a draft. Your offer must be completed and fully published to retain its co-sell status, incentives, and referral pipeline. For steps to publish in commercial marketplace in Partner Center, see [Publishing a draft offer in the commercial marketplace](#publishing-a-draft-offer-in-the-commercial-marketplace) below.

### This offer is no longer relevant

Select this option when some of your OCP GTM solutions are obsolete or no longer relevant to co-sell with Microsoft. You will be asked to confirm discarding it. You can undo the discard later.

1. Select **This offer is no longer relevant** (see **Begin your migration** image [above](#beginmigration)), then **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/get-support-link.png" alt-text="The support link on the Get Help tab.":::

## Publishing a draft offer in the commercial marketplace

If you selected that your offer is new to the commercial marketplace, your OCP GTM offer will copy over as a draft. Your offer must be fully published in the commercial marketplace in Partner Center in order to retain its co-sell status, incentives, and referral pipeline.
1. On the **Overview** page, search for your draft offer name and select it.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/offer-overview.png" alt-text="The offer overview page in Partner Center.":::

2. Complete all the required information in each tab. You must complete the customer-facing and (optionally) reseller-facing offer details. The **Learn more** links and tooltips in Partner Center will guide you through the requirements and details.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/offer-setup.png" alt-text="The offer overview setup tabs in Partner Center.":::

3. Some of the Microsoft seller-facing details were copied over from the OCP GTM solution. Complete the remaining required information in the **Co-sell with Microsoft** tab to continue co-selling your offer. Once complete, select **Review and publish** to continue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/co-sell-page.png" alt-text="The offer co-sell tab in Partner Center.":::

4. After reviewing all submitted information, select **Publish** to submit your draft offer for certification review.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/co-sell-review-publish.png" alt-text="The offer review tab and Publish button in Partner Center.":::

5. Track the status of your submission on the **Overview** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/offer-overview-page.png" alt-text="The offer publish status bar on the Overview tab in Partner Center.":::

6. We will notify you when our certification review is complete. If we provide actionable feedback, address it, then select **Publish** to initiate a recertification.
7. Once your offer passes certification, preview the offer with the link provided and make any final adjustments you may want. When you're ready, select **Go live** to publish your offer to relevant commercial marketplace storefront(s). Once live, your offer will retain its co-sell status from the original OCP GTM solution.
