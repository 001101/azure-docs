# Migrate co-sell solutions from OCP GTM to Partner Center

## Why is Microsoft moving publishing from OCP GTM to Partner Center?

The commercial marketplace provides simplified offer publishing to co-sell through Microsoft's three channels. As opposed to the One Commercial Partner Go-To-Market (OCP GTM) tool, it does this by centralizing offer creation and management in Partner Center where you are already managing your relationship with Microsoft. When you publish your offer in the commercial marketplace you benefit from: 

- Co-selling with all three channels (direct customer, Microsoft partner, and Microsoft seller) with a single solution. 
- The best Microsoft online store (AppSource or Azure Marketplace) is identified for you through the publishing experience for the direct channel.
- â€¢Solutions meet the technical validation needed to become co-sell ready. 
- You drive the solutions that you want to publish for co-selling with Microsoft. 

## Changes in requirements for participating in co-sell

For your solution to be discoverable to Microsoft sellers and partners, it must meet [co-sell ready requirements](marketplace-co-sell.md#co-sell-publishing-steps-and-requirements). To capture a Microsoft seller's attention, your solution must meet the [incentive-eligible requirements](marketplace-co-sell.md#marketplace-benefits-for-incentivized-offers). Complete these requirements on the co-sell tab in commercial marketplace.
