# Migration of co-sell solutions from OCP GTM to the commercial marketplace

## Why is Microsoft moving the publishing experience from OCP GTM to Partner Center?

The commercial marketplace within Partner Center provides simplified offer publishing to co-sell through Microsoft's three channels by centralizing offer creation and management in Partner Center, where a partner is already managing their relationship with Microsoft.

As a Microsoft partner enrolled in the commercial marketplace, you can:

- Publish your offers centrally and co-sell across Microsoft direct customer, partner, and seller channels.
- Ensure your offers are in the correct online store—[Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) or [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com)—to reach the millions of cloud customers who align with your offer capabilities.
- Drive your own publishing experience to co-sell with the offers that align with your business goals.
- Align your offer publishing within Partner Center, where you are already managing your Microsoft relationship and co-sell opportunities.
- Unlock Marketplace Rewards.

## Process updates for participating in co-sell

For your solution to be discoverable to Microsoft sellers and partners, it must meet the [co-sell ready requirements](marketplace-co-sell.md). For a Microsoft seller to be incentivized, your solution must meet the [incentive-eligible requirements](marketplace-co-sell.md). Complete these requirements on the co-sell tab in the commercial marketplace.

## Continue co-selling with Microsoft

To continue co-selling with Microsoft, make sure you have an active Microsoft Partner Network membership and are enrolled in the commercial marketplace in Partner Center.

- If you are not a partner in the Microsoft Partner Network, join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) at no cost. As a partner, you'll have access to exclusive resources, programs, tools, and connections to grow your business.
- If you do not have an account in commercial marketplace, [enroll now](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account) to continue co-selling with Microsoft and access the full publishing experience.

After you've enrolled in the commercial marketplace, prepare to merge your solutions from OCP GTM into the commercial marketplace.

First, review them in OCP GTM. You should have received an email with a link unique to your OCP GTM experience. Then follow these steps to publish your offers.

1. Visit your company's publisher list. It includes the account owner, managers and developers who have publishing access. Learn more about [Partner Center user roles](/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/manage-account#define-user-roles-and-permissions).
2. Ask one of the listed contacts to add users to the commercial marketplace as *managers* or *developers*.
3. Work with your developers to move your solutions from your OCP GTM account to the commercial marketplace.

## Migrate your solutions from OCP GTM to commercial marketplace

1. Begin the migration by signing into [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/solutions/migration).
2. Check the **Overview** page to review information about your solution migrations.

    :::image type="content" source="media/co-sell-migrate/solutions-tab.png" alt-text="Partner Center Overview page, Solutions tab.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > This tab will note if there aren't any solutions pending to migrate to the commercial marketplace. To continue co-selling with Microsoft, ensure the migrated solutions are published in the commercial marketplace.

     Learn more about the solution status by reviewing the tool tips. All solutions pending action are listed under **Action Required**.

  1. Select **Begin migration** for the solution to migrate to commercial marketplace in Partner Center, then select one of the following options:

    - This is similar to an existing offer in commercial marketplace
    - This offer will be new to commercial marketplace
    - This offer is no longer relevant

Existing offer in commercial marketplace

  1. You may already have an offer published in the commercial marketplace that is the same as a solution published to OCP GTM. To avoid creating duplicate offers in commercial marketplace, select 'This is similar to an existing offer in commercial marketplace'. You will see live commercial marketplace offers that your OCP GTM solution can be associated with. Select the live offer from the list or enter the Marketplace URL. Click continue, and you will be redirected to Support to submit a migration request ticket. The indicated OCP GTM solution metadata will be merged into the selected commercial marketplace offer.

Offer will be new to commercial marketplace

  1. You may have an OCP GTM solution that does not yet have a corresponding offer published to the commercial marketplace. You will need to publish this solution to the commercial marketplace to continue co-selling with Microsoft, and migrating this solution will save you time by retaining Microsoft seller-facing metadata. If you select that the offer will be new to commercial marketplace, you will be required to select the offer type that best matches with your offer.

Offer is no longer relevant

  1. You may find that some of your OCP GTM solutions are obsolete or no longer relevant to co-sell with Microsoft. If you select that your offer is no longer relevant, you will be asked to confirm discarding it. You can undo the discard later.

Publishing draft offer in commercial marketplace

  1. If you selected that your offer is new to commercial marketplace, your OCP GTM offer will copy over to commercial marketplace as a 'draft'. Your offer must be fully published in the commercial marketplace in Partner Center in order to retain its co-sell status, incentives, and referral pipeline.
  2. You can find your draft offer under the Overview page. You can search for your draft offer using the offer name, click on the draft offer, and complete all the required information in each tab. You must complete the customer-facing and (optionally) reseller-facing offer details. The &quot;Learn more&quot; links and tooltips in Partner Center will guide you through the requirements and details.

![](RackMultipart20201112-4-8ih11c_html_91543461fcff84ca.gif) ![](RackMultipart20201112-4-8ih11c_html_cd9b228f097214d7.gif) ![](RackMultipart20201112-4-8ih11c_html_9392f9a39c446275.gif) ![](RackMultipart20201112-4-8ih11c_html_8fac58ca96691699.png)

  1. You can review all the submitted information. Once reviewed, click 'Publish' to submit your draft offer for certification review. You can then track the status of your offer in the Offer Overview tab. Note: you will need to complete the next step to retain your solution's co-sell status.

  1. After certification review, you will receive a notification with either actionable feedback or indicating that your offer is ready for preview and signoff. If feedback is provided, address it, and click 'Publish' to initiate a recertification. Once your offer passes certification, preview the offer with the link provided and make any final tweaks, if needed. Once satisfied with your offer, click &quot;Go live&quot; to approve publication of your offer to relevant commercial marketplace storefront(s). Once this step is completed, your offer will retain the co-sell status from the original OCP GTM solution.
