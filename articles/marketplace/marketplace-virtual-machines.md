# Plan a virtual machine offer

This article explains the different options and requirements for publishing a virtual machine (VM) offer to the commercial marketplace. VM offers are transactable offers deployed and billed through Azure Marketplace).

Before you start, [Create a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account) and ensure your account is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program.

## Technical requirements

A VM contains two components:

- **Operating system virtual hard disk (VHD)** – Contains the operating system and solution that deploys with your offer. The process of preparing the VHD differs depending on whether it is a Linux-, Windows-, or custom-based VM.
- **Data disk VHDs** (optional) – Dedicated, persistent storage for a VM. Don't use the operating system VHD (for example, the C: drive) to store persistent information. 
    - You can include up to 16 data disks.
    - Use one VHD per data disk, even if the disk is blank.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of which operating system you use, add only the minimum number of data disks needed by the solution. Customers cannot remove disks that are part of an image at the time of deployment, but they can always add disks during or after deployment.

VM offers have the following technical requirements:

- You must prepare one operating system virtual hard disk (VHD). Data disk VHDs are optional.
- You must create at least one plan for your offer. Your plan is priced based on the [licensing option](#licensing-options) you select.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Every VM Image in a plan must have the same number of data disks.
- The customer can cancel your offer at any time.

The process of designing, building, and testing offers takes time and requires expertise in both the Azure platform and the technologies used to build your offer. Your engineering team should have a working knowledge of the following Microsoft technologies:

- [Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/)
- [Design and architecture of Azure applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/architecture/)
- [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/), [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/?filter=storage#storage), and [Azure Networking](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/?filter=networking#networking)

## Plans and pricing

VM offers require at least one plan. A plan defines the solution scope and limits, and the associated pricing. You can create multiple plans for your offer to give your customers different technical and licensing options, as well as free trials. See [Plans and pricing for commercial marketplace offers](plans-pricing.md) for general guidance about plans, including pricing models, free trials, and private plans. 

VMs are fully commerce-enabled, using pay-as-you-go or bring-your-own-license (BYOL) licensing models. Microsoft hosts the commerce transaction and bills your customer on your behalf. You get the benefit of using the preferred payment relationship between your customer and Microsoft, including any Enterprise Agreements. For more information, see [Commercial marketplace transact capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations).

> [!NOTE]
> The monetary commitments associated with an Enterprise Agreement can be used against the Azure usage of your VM, but not against your software licensing fees.

### Licensing options

As you prepare to publish a new VM offer, you need to decide which licensing option to choose. This will determine what additional information you'll need to provide later as you create your offer in Partner Center.

These are the available licensing options for VM offers:

| Licensing option | Transaction process |
| --- | --- |
| Free trial | Offer your customers a one-, three- or six-month free trial. |
| Test drive | This option lets your customers evaluate VMs at no additional cost to them. They don't need to be an existing Azure customer to engage with the trial experience. For details, see [What is a test drive?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/what-is-test-drive) |
| BYOL | The Bring Your Own Licensing option lets your customers bring existing software licenses to Azure.\* |
| Usage-based | Also known as pay-as-you-go, this option lets your customers pay per hour. |
| Interactive demo  | Give your customers a guided experience of your solution using an interactive demonstration. The benefit is that you can offer a trial experience without having to provide a complicated setup of your complex solution. |
|

\* As the publisher, you support all aspects of the software license transaction, including (but not limited to) order, fulfillment, metering, billing, invoicing, payment, and collection.

The following example shows a VM offer in Azure Marketplace that has usage-based pricing.

### Private offers

You can restrict the discovery and deployment of your VM to a specific set of customers by publishing the image and pricing as a Private Offer. Private Offers unlock the ability for you to create exclusive offers for your closest customers and offer customized software and terms. The customized terms enable you to highlight a variety of scenarios, including field-led deals with specialized pricing and terms as well as early access to limited release software. Private Offers enable you to give specific pricing or products to a limited set of customers by creating a new plan with those details.

For more information, see [**Private Offers on Azure Marketplace**](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/private-offers-on-azure-marketplace).


## Test drives


## Customer leads

You must connect your offer to your customer relationship management (CRM) system to collect customer information. The customer will be asked for permission to share their information. These customer details, along with the offer name, ID, and online store where they found your offer, will be sent to the CRM system that you've configured. The commercial marketplace supports a variety of CRM systems, along with the option to use an Azure table or configure an HTTPS endpoint using Power Automate.

You can add or modify a CRM connection at any time during or after offer creation. For detailed guidance, see
[Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md).

## Legal contracts

To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a standard contract you can use for your offers in the commercial marketplace. When you offer your software under the standard contract, customers only need to read and accept it one time, and you don't have to create custom terms and conditions.

If you choose to use the standard contract, you have the option to add universal amendment terms and up to 10 custom amendments to the standard contract. You can also use your own terms and conditions instead of the standard contract. You will manage these details in the **Properties** page. For detailed information, see [Standard contract for Microsoft commercial marketplace](standard-contract.md).

> [!NOTE]
> After you publish an offer using the standard contract for the commercial marketplace, you cannot use your own custom terms and conditions. It is an "or" scenario. You either offer your solution under the standard contract or your own terms and conditions. If you want to modify the terms of the standard contract you can do so through Standard Contract Amendments.

## Offer listing details

When you [create a new SaaS offer](create-new-saas-offer.md) in Partner Center, you will enter text, images, optional videos, and other details on the **Offer listing** page. This is the information that customers will see when they discover your offer listing in the commercial marketplace, as shown in the following example.

## Additional sales opportunities

You can choose to opt into Microsoft-supported marketing and sales channels. When creating your offer in Partner Center, you will see two tabs toward the end of the process:

- **Resell through CSPs**: Use this option to allow Microsoft Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) partners to resell your solution as part of a bundled offer. See [Cloud Solution Provider program](cloud-solution-providers.md) for more information.

- **Co-sell with Microsoft**: This option lets Microsoft sales teams consider your IP co-sell eligible solution when evaluating their customers’ needs. See [Co-sell option in Partner Center](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-co-sell.md) for detailed information on how to prepare your offer for evaluation.



> [!NOTE]
> The Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner channel opt-in is now available. For more information about marketing your offer through Microsoft CSP partner channels, see [**Cloud Solution Providers**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-solution-providers).


FROM OTHER ARTICLE: 
## Category

Select categories and subcategories to place your offer in the appropriate marketplace search areas. Be sure to describe how your offer supports these categories in the offer description. Select:

- At least one and up to two categories, including a primary and a secondary category (optional).
- Up to two subcategories for each primary and/or secondary category. If no subcategory is applicable to your offer, select **Not applicable**.

See the full list of categories and subcategories in [Offer Listing Best Practices](gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md). Virtual machine offers always appear under the **Compute** category on Azure Marketplace.

## Legal

You must provide offer terms and conditions to your customers. You have two options: use your own terms and conditions, or use the Standard Contract for the Microsoft commercial marketplace.

- **Use your own terms and conditions**

   To provide your own custom terms and conditions, enter up to 10,000 characters of text in the **Terms and conditions** box. If you require a longer description, enter a single web address for your terms and conditions. It will be displayed to customers as an active link.

   Your customers must accept these terms before they can try your offer.

- **Use the Standard Contract for the Microsoft commercial marketplace**

   To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a Standard Contract for the commercial marketplace. When you offer your software under the Standard Contract, customers need to read and accept it only once, and you don't have to creating custom terms and conditions.

   Use the Standard Contract by selecting the **Use the Standard Contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace** check box and then, in the pop-up window, select **Accept** (you might have to scroll up to view it).

   ![Screenshot showing the Legal pane in Partner Center with the "Use the Standard Contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace" check box.](media/use-standard-contract.png)

  > [!NOTE]
  > After you publish an offer by using the Standard Contract for the commercial marketplace, you can't use your own custom terms and conditions. You can offer a solution under either the Standard Contract or your own terms and conditions.

  For more information, see [Standard Contract for the Microsoft commercial marketplace](standard-contract.md). Download the [Standard Contract](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2041178) PDF file (make sure your pop-up blocker is turned off).

  ## Standard Contract amendments

  Standard Contract amendments let you select the Standard Contract terms for simplicity and create the terms for your product or business. Customers need to review the amendments to the contract only if they've already reviewed and accepted the Microsoft Standard Contract. There are two types of amendments:

  * **Universal amendments**: These amendments are applied universally to the Standard Contract for all customers. They are shown to every customer of the offer in the purchase flow. Customers must accept the terms of the Standard Contract and the amendments before they can use your offer. You can provide a single universal amendment per offer. You can enter an unlimited number of characters in this box. These terms are displayed to customers in AppSource, Azure Marketplace, and/or the Azure portal during the discovery and purchase flow.

  * **Custom amendments**: These special amendments to the Standard Contract are targeted to specific customers through Azure tenant IDs. You can choose the tenant you want to target. Only customers from the tenant are presented with the custom amendment terms in the offer's purchase flow. Customers must accept the terms of the Standard Contract and the amendments before they can use your offer.

    1. Start by selecting **Add custom amendment terms (Max 10)**. You can provide up to ten custom amendment terms per offer. Do the following:

       a. Enter your own amendment terms in the **Custom amendment terms** box. You can enter an unlimited number of characters. Only customers from the tenant IDs that you specify for these custom terms will see them in the offer's purchase flow in the Azure portal.

       b. (Required) Provide **Tenant IDs**. Each custom amendment can be targeted to up to 20 tenant IDs. If you add a custom amendment, you must provide at least one tenant ID, which identifies your customer in Azure. Your customer can find this for you in Azure by selecting **Azure Active Directory** > **Properties**. The directory ID value is the tenant ID (for example, 50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e). You can also find the organization's tenant ID of your customer by using their domain name web address at [What is my Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 tenant ID?](https://www.whatismytenantid.com/).

       c. (Optional) Provide a friendly **Description** for the tenant ID, one that helps you identify the customer that you're targeting with the amendment.

        > [!NOTE]
        > These two types of amendments are paired with each other. Customers who are targeted with custom amendments will also get the universal amendments to the Standard Contract during the purchase.
