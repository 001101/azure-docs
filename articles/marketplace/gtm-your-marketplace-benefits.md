# Your commercial marketplace benefits

As part of your publishing journey, you need to create technical and marketing assets for your offer. As a result, there are technical and marketing benefits that Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace publishers can use in order to improve customer engagement with your offer, and support you in growing your marketplace presence and impact.

When you go live with your offer, the Marketplace Rewards team will reach out to you to you based on your eligibility to deliver benefits or begin the engagement.

## Marketplace Rewards

As you increase your investment in marketplace, you increase your available rewards. You start with awareness-based activities when you first launch your offer and move on to demand generation and co-selling activities.

Your benefits are differentiated based on whether your offer is [List, Trial, or Transact](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#choose-a-publishing-option).

You will be contacted by a member of the Rewards team when your offer goes live, based on your eligibility. 

For Transact partners, as you grow your billed sales through the marketplace platform, you unlock greater benefits per tier. 

The minimum requirement to publish in the storefronts is an MPNID, so these benefits are available to all partners regardless of MPN competency status or partner type. Each partner is empowered to grow their business through the marketplace as a platform.

You will get support in understanding the resources available to you and in implementing the best practices, which you can also [review on on your own](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/azure-marketplace-and-appsource-publisher-toolkit#/). 

Detailed descriptions of all program benefits can be found in the [Marketplace Rewards program deck](https://aka.ms/marketplacerewards).

To access these benefits, you will need to:

1. Publish an offer in either Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace.
2. The team reaches out to the “owner” or “primary contact” per marketplace offer. It is a best practice to enter either an individual or an alias you check regularly: messages sent to aliases such as info@company.com often get lost.

>[!Note]
>If your offer has been live for more than 3 weeks and you have not received a message, please check within your organization who is the owner of the offer in question, either by looking in Cloud Partner Portal or in Partner Center. They should have the communication and next steps. <br> <br> If you cannot determine the owner, or if the owner has left your company, you can raise a support ticket at https://aka.ms/marketplacepublisher_support(??).

The scope of the activities available to you expands as you grow your offerings in the marketplace. All listings receive a base level of optimization recommendations and promotion as part of a self-serve email of resources and best practices.

## MarketplaceList, trial, and consulting benefits

If you publish a trial or consulting proof of concept, implementation, or workshop, you will be assigned an engagement manager for three months, who will help guide you in a successful go-to-market plan. You can repeat this three-month engagement each time you publish a new offer, to help get each of your new offers started with success.

The table below summarize the eligibility requirements for list and trial offers:

## Marketplace Rewards for transact partners

When you go live with your transactable offer in either Azure Marketplace or AppSource, you are able to access additional benefits as you grow your billed sales transactions through the commercial marketplace. 

These benefits are designed to support you in marketing, sales, and technical activities, and thereby helping you to get more visitors, more leads, and convert more business.

All partners who have a live offer get to work with a dedicated engagement manager to choose the highest-value activities and across your portfolio of marketplace offers. This engagement is evergreen per offer, meaning you can choose your activities and the timing of these activities to be part of your marketing and sales strategies.

![Technical benefits](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/technical-benefit.png)

Detailed descriptions for all of these benefits can be found in the [Marketplace Rewards program deck](https://aka.ms/marketplacerewards).

In addition to the rewards benefits, Business applications partners with Dynamics offers published to Microsoft AppSource have supplementary programming available to them through [ISV Connect](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/business-applications/isv-overview). This includes technical, marketing, and sales support that is specialized for the needs of business applications partners.
