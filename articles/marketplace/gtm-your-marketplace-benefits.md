# Your commercial marketplace benefits

As part of your publishing journey, you need to create technical and marketing assets for your offer. As a result, there are technical and marketing benefits that Azure Marketplace and AppSource publishers can use in order to improve customer engagement with your offer. You may find the technical resources below useful.

When you go live with your offer, you become eligible for Marketplace Rewards based on the listing type of your offer.

## Marketplace Rewards

As you increase your investment in marketplace, you increase your available rewards. You start with awareness-based activities when you first launch your offer, and move on to demand generation and co-selling activities.

Your benefits are differentiated based on whether your offer is [List, Trial, or Transact](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#choose-a-publishing-option).

For Transact partners, as you grow your billed sales through the marketplace platform, you unlock greater benefits per tier. 

The minimum requirement to publish in the storefronts is an MPNID, so these benefits are available to all partners regardless of MPN competency status or partner type. Each partner is empowered to grow their business through the marketplace as a platform.

## How to access Microsoft resources

The Go-to-Market benefits are accessible to partners who have recently published an offer. 

1. Onboarding: [Register](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/sell) to get access to the Cloud Partner Portal or Partner Center, and onboarding support resources.
2. Microsoft Marketplaces Consultation: Take advantage of this [FREE consultation](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4010317/microsoft-marketplaces-consultation) to help plan the architecture of your app in marketplace.
3. Marketplace Forums: Ask your questions directly to Microsoft employees and other marketplace partners in the [Marketplace forum](https://www.microsoftpartnercommunity.com/t5/Azure-Marketplace-and-AppSource/bd-p/2222).
4. Technical Support: Use the Help menu in [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) or Partner Center to get help on your marketplace-related support questions. 

## Go-to-market (GTM) benefits in the Marketplace

New listings in both Azure Marketplace and AppSource are eligible to receive free marketplace GTM benefits through our Microsoft GTM Services team. This team will help you optimize your listings and increase awareness for your solutions in the Microsoft marketplace.

Your GTM support includes templates, web content, training, and tools to promote your business.

To access these benefits, you will need to:

1. Publish an offer in either Azure Marketplace or AppSource.
2. Ensure you have entered a marketing contact in the **contact information** portion of your offer. This should be a dedicated marketing resource, as opposed to a catch-all alias. (i.e, avoid using “support\@”, “info\@”, “marketing\@”, etc.)

The scope of the activities available to you expands as you grow your offerings in the marketplace. All listings receive a base level of optimization recommendations and promotion as part of a self-serve email of resources and best practices. 

If you publish a trial or consulting proof of concept, implementation, or workshop, you will be assigned an engagement manager for three months, who will help guide you in a successful go-to-market plan. You can repeat this three month engagement each time you publish a new offer, to help get each of your new offers started with success.

The table below summarize the eligibility requirements for list and trial offers:

## Marketplace Rewards for transact partners

When you go live with your transactable offer in either Azure Marketplace or AppSource, you are able to access additional benefits as you grow your billed sales transactions through the commercial marketplace. 

These benefits are designed to support you in marketing, sales, and technical activities, and thereby helping you to get more visitors, more leads, and convert more business.

All partners who have a live offer get to work with a dedicated engagement manager to choose the highest-value activities and across your portfolio of marketplace offers. This engagement is evergreen per offer, meaning you can choose your activities and the timing of these activities to be part of your marketing and sales strategies.
