# Marketing best practices

Publishing your offer in marketplace is just the first step. Furthermore, you need to determine how to optimize your listing to drive for maximum impact. The good news is that by publishing a listing in marketplace, you begin to unlock significant joint Go-To-Market (GTM) activities with Microsoft.  In order to get the most out of this new GTM initiative and truly grow your business, you want to include your new listing as part of your existing marketing and sales activities.

The quality of your marketplace offer and your commitment to customer-centric demand help to drive your business growth. Your engagement in these activities helps Microsoft to amplify your GTM work, in order to feature key solutions across storefronts in the marketplace.

After youâ€™ve created a great listing, the following marketing initiatives will help you grow your business:

* *Build a strong value proposition.* <br>Identify your potential customer and the key differentiators of your solution.

* *Create a unique landing page on your site to make your app listing stand out.* <br> Drive traffic from your site to your offer and make a great first impression. Based on your offer listing, customers decide whether they want to learn more and try your solutions.

* *Enable a test drive or other trial experience.* <br> Users want to experience your app firsthand. Publishers have historically seen much higher lead conversion rates from listings that offer a test drive or trial.

* *Optimize your listing to help boost search engine rankings.* <br> Incorporate search keywords in your app name, summary, and listing. 

* *Build your demand-generation plan.* <br> Use your marketplace offer listing as the landing page for marketing calls to action. If you've enabled lead sharing, each time customers try, test drive, or deploy your offer from the landing page, you obtain their name and contact information.

* *Promote your app on AppSource and/or in the Azure Marketplace.* <br> Link to your app listing, and use URL tagging each time you link to your app.

* *Create marketing and promotion campaigns.* <br> Plan and build campaigns to drive awareness and engagement, with a clear call to action that directs traffic to your marketplace listing.

* *Get customer feedback.* <br> Invite your customers to submit a rating and review of your listing site. After they've started a trial, they receive an email message inviting them to share their experience with other customers.
