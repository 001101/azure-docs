# How to market your SaaS offer

This article describes additional marketing options you can choose, if youâ€™re selling your software as a service (SaaS) offer through Microsoft. You can co-sell your offer with Microsoft, resell it through Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs), or both.

## Co-sell with Microsoft

Providing information on the **Co-sell with Microsoft** page is entirely optional. But it's required to achieve _Co-sell Ready_ and _IP Co-sell Ready_ status. The Microsoft sales teams use this information to learn more about your solution when evaluating its fit for customer needs. The information you provide on this tab isn't available directly to customers.

For details and instructions to configure the **Co-sell with Microsoft** tab, see [Co-sell option in Partner Center](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-co-sell.md).

## Resell through CSPs

Electing to make your offer available in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program enables CSPs to sell your product as part of a bundled solution to their customers. For more information about reselling your offer through CSPs and step-by-step instructions to configure the **Resell through CSPs** tab, see [Cloud Solution Providers](cloud-solution-providers.md).

## Next steps

After you finish creating your offer, the next step is to review and publish it. For help reviewing and publishing your offer, see [Review and publish an offer](review-publish-offer.md).
