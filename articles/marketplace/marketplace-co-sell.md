# Co-sell partner engagement

You can use the Microsoft Co-sell program to work directly with Microsoft sellers on joint selling opportunities and to unlock additional marketplace benefits. The program helps you reach a vast community of customers and create new sales opportunities to accelerate your business growth.

The Co-sell program is available for **services** with Microsoft technology embedded and for repeatable, packaged **intellectual property (IP) solutions**. Offers in the Co-sell program are either **co-sell ready** or **co-sell incentivized**, depending on the requirements they meet.

Some IP solutions can qualify for Microsoft seller incentives when they're successfully sold and deployed with Microsoft field sales teams.

## Marketplace benefits for incentivized offers

Offers that attain **Azure IP Co-sell incentivized** status unlock these additional marketplace benefits:

* The marketplace service fee is reduced from 20% to 10%. This discount applies to IaaS and SaaS offers sold through the commercial marketplace. See [Reduced Service Fee](marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations.md#reduced-service-fee) for more details.
* Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners receive a 10% incentive to sell your IaaS and SaaS offers. Learn more about the CSP program at [Cloud Solution Provider program](cloud-solution-providers.md).
* Sales of your offers through commercial marketplace will contribute towards customers’ Azure consumption commitments. Eligible customers will see the offer marked as **"Azure benefit eligible"** in the Azure Portal. See [Azure consumption commitment benefit](azure-consumption-commitment-benefit.md) for more details.
* Your offers will receive a **"Preferred solutions"** badge in the storefronts. The badge promotes the offers’ quality, performance, and ability to address customer needs in a certain industry vertical or solution area. Learn more at [Preferred solutions in Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace](preferred-solutions.md).
