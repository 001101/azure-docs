# Cloud Partner Portal migration to Partner Center

To streamline your account and offer management experience, Microsoft is migrating offers from Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center. If you manage or create co-sell offer listings in the One Commercial Partner Go-to-Market (OCP GTM) catalog, that offer management experience will also be available in Partner Center.
