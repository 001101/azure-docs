## Recoupment policy

### Definition

There are times when customers fail to pay Microsoft for transactions in the commercial marketplace, even after a thorough collections process. When these funds are written off, we will recoup funds from publishers if a written-off payout was made.

### Funds written off as uncollectable

When a customer fails to pay Microsoft according to their billing schedule, Microsoft begins the collections process. The collections process takes approximately four months and involves persistent communication from Microsoft. If payment is not received by the end of this process, Microsoft writes off the funds as uncollectable.

### Recoupment process

After the customer's charges are written off as uncollectable, the recoupment process begins. This involves withholding future payouts to the publisher to true up the account. For example, if we write off $1,000 in payouts that were already made, then future payouts to the publisher are withheld until we recover this amount.
