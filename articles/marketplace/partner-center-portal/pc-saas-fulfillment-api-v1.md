# SaaS Fulfillment APIs version 1 (deprecated)

This article explains how to create a SaaS offer with APIs. The APIs, composed of REST methods and endpoints, are necessary for allowing subscriptions to your SaaS offer if you have Sell
through Azure selected.  

> [!WARNING]
> This initial version of the SaaS Fulfillment API is deprecated; instead, use [SaaS Fulfillment API V2](./pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2.md).  This initial version of the API is currently being maintained only to serve existing publishers. 

The documentation for this version of the API is no longer available. If you feel that you need to access it, please contact saas-api-v1@microsoft.com.

For all new developments, move to [V2 version of the API](./pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2.md) even if you already use V1.  V1 version of this API will be completely deprecated.
