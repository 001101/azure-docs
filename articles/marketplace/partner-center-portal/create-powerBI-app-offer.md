# Create a Power BI App

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We're moving the management of your Power BI app offers from Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center. Until your Power BI app offers are migrated, please continue to follow the instructions in [Create a Power BI app offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/power-bi/cpp-create-offer) in Cloud Partner Portal to manage your offers.

This article describes how to create and publish a Power BI App offer to the Microsoft [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). Before you can create a Power BI app, you must create a [Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account) account.

## Create a new offer

1. In the left-navigation menu, select **Commercial Marketplace** , then **Overview**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-menu-overview.png" alt-text="overview of the commercial marketplace menu" border="false":::

2. Select **+ New offer** , then select **Power BI App**. The **New offer** dialog box appears.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the **Power BI App** option isn&#39;t shown or isn&#39;t enabled, your account doesn&#39;t have permission to create this offer type. Please check that you&#39;ve met all the [requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/power-bi/cpp-prerequisites) for this offer type, including registering for a developer account

### Offer ID and alias

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the marketplace offer and Azure Resource Manager templates, if applicable.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. It can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces, and is limited to 50 characters. For example, if you enter **test-offer-1** , the offer web address will be `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/../test-offer-1`.

- The Offer ID can&#39;t be changed after you select **Create**.

Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name won&#39;t be used in the marketplace and is different from the offer name and other values shown to customers.
- This can&#39;t be changed after you select **Create**.

After you enter these two values, select **Create** to continue.

## Offer overview

This page shows the steps required to publish this offer (both completed and upcoming) and how long each step should take to complete.

It includes links to perform operations on this offer based on the selection you make. For example:

- If the offer is a draft - [Delete draft offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/update-existing-offer#delete-a-draft-offer)
- If the offer is live - [Stop selling the offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/update-existing-offer#stop-selling-an-offer-or-plan)
- If the offer is in preview - [Go-live](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/publishing-status#publisher-approval)
- If you haven&#39;t completed publisher sign-out - [Cancel publishing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/update-existing-offer#cancel-publishing)

Continue below.

## Offer setup

### Connect lead management

When publishing your offer to the marketplace with Partner Center, you must connect it to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system so you can receive customer contact information as soon as someone expresses interest in or uses your product.

1. Select a lead destination where you want us to send customer leads. Partner Center supports the following CRM systems:

    - [Dynamics 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics) for customer engagement
    - [Marketo](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo)
    - [Salesforce](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-salesforce)

    If your CRM system isn&#39;t listed above, use [Azure Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table) or [Https Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-https) to store customer lead data. Then export the data to your CRM system.

2. Connect your offer to the lead destination when publishing in Partner Center.
3. Confirm that the connection to the lead destination is configured properly. After you publish it in Partner Center, we&#39;ll validate the connection and send you a test lead. While you preview the offer before it goes live, you can also test your lead connection by trying to acquire the offer yourself in the preview environment.
4. Ensure the connection to the lead destination stays updated so you don&#39;t lose any leads.

## Properties

This page lets you define the categories and industries used to group your offer on the marketplace, your app version, and the legal contracts supporting your offer.

Select a minimum of one and a maximum of three categories. These are used to place your offer into the appropriate marketplace search areas. Explain in the offer description how your offer supports these categories.

### Industry

If your offer isn&#39;t industry-specific, leave this section blank.

> [!NOTE]
> As we work to introduce new industries and verticals to improve the offer discovery experience, some industries or verticals may not yet be visible on the Storefront. Industries and verticals marked with an (*) will be available at a future date. All published offers are discoverable via keyword search.

Define marketplace details (such as offer name, description, and images) for each language/market. Select the language/market name to provide this info.

> [!NOTE]
> Offer details are not required to be in English if the offer description begins with the phrase, &quot;This application is available only in [non-English language].&quot; It&#39;s also okay to provide a Useful Link to offer content in a language that&#39;s different from the one used in the offer listing.

### Name

The name you enter here displays as the title of your offer. This field is pre-filled with the text you entered in the **Offer alias** box when you created the offer, but can be changed.

The name:

- May be trademarked (and you may include trademark or copyright symbols).
- Can&#39;t be more than 50 characters long.
- Can&#39;t include emojis.

### Search results summary

Provide a short description of your offer. This can be up to 100 characters long and is used in marketplace search results.

### Description

Provide a longer description of your offer, up to 3000 characters. This is displayed to customers in the marketplace listing overview. Include your offer&#39;s value proposition, key benefits, category and/or industry associations, in-app purchase opportunities, and any required disclosures.

Here are some tips for writing your description:

- Clearly describe the value of your offer in the first few sentences of your description. Include the following items:
  - Description of the product.
  - The type of user that benefits from the product.
  - Customer needs or issues the product addresses.
- Remember that the first few sentences might be displayed in search results.
- Don&#39;t rely on features and functionality to sell your product. Instead, focus on the value your offer provides.
- Try to use industry-specific vocabulary or benefit-based wording.

To make your offer **Description** more engaging, use the rich text editor to format your description. The rich text editor lets you add numbers, bullets, bold, italics, and indents to make your description more readable.
