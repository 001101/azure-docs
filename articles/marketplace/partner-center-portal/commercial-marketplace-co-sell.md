# Co-sell option in Partner Center

Providing information on the Co-sell tab is entirely optional. It is required to achieve Co-sell Ready and IP Co-sell Ready status. The information you provide will be used by Microsoft sales teams to learn more about your solution when evaluating its fit for customer needs.  It is not available directly to customers. For more information, see [sell through Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-saas-offer#sell-through-microsoft).

## Applicable products

Choose any of the Microsoft products that your offer is built on top of or designed to work with.

**SMB:** Small and medium-sized businesses (< 500 employees)

**Corporate:** (< 2500 employees)

**Enterprise:** Large enterprise companies (2500+ employees)

## Customer Segments

Select the size of business that your offer is targeting.

## Offer type

Select your offer type:

| **Offer type**    | **Description**  |
| :------------------- | :-------------------|
| Device | A Device is OEM hardware.  This offer type can be used for an offer that involves building or selling OEM hardware. |
| IP | Also called Apps, IP is copyrightable material that is licensed for use. For example, IP might be a CRM program that can be licensed and installed on premises. |
| Service | A service typically delivers expertise for a specific project, often via consultants. For example, a service might set up a customer database for a client; the client would then assume responsibility for operating the database after delivery. |
| Managed Service | A managed service typically delivers and manages cloud-based services; for example, a managed service provider might offer a platform and tools for running a database online. Operations would then be provided by the managed service provider on an ongoing basis. |

## Solution Areas

You can add up to three solution areas for your offer.  For each solution area, you can choose up to two solution subareas. To select multiple subcategories, use the `Ctrl` key (on Windows) or Command key (on Mac OS).

Solution areas help define the scenarios that your offer is designed to address.

## Documents

| **Documents**    | **Description**  |
| :------------------- | :-------------------|
| *Customer one-pager* | 1-2 page customer-ready description of your offering.

| *Reference architecture diagrams* | A document showing the model that represents the IP created by the partner, along with its relationship with Microsoft cloud services, and how it meets the technical requirements of the IP Co-sell program. |
| *Other documents* | Optionally, you may upload up to five additional documents or videos to help Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers to learn more about your solution, organization, and/or differentiators. |
| *External reference URL* | The link to your product’s site, where Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers can learn more about your solution. |

## Contacts

Your contact information allows Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers to request additional information from the appropriate resource in your organization. Contact information is available to all Microsoft sales teams. If you elect to make your offer available in the CSP program, this contact information is also available to channel resellers. 

This document provides guidance on the different roles for partners and how to choose between them. You can provide your contacts by downloading the CSV template from Partner Center, filling in each row with information about the contact, and importing this CSV file. Importing a CSV file will overwrite the existing contacts.

You can also export your existing list of contacts of an offer, and then make changes on that file.

* *Name*: The contact's name (required).
* *Email address*: The contact's email address (required).
* *Job title*: Job title (required).
* *Role*: Use one of the following roles in this field in the template.

    | **Role**    | **Description**  |
    | :------------------- | :-------------------|
    | *Partner marketing* | This role focuses on marketing your solution and collaborating on marketing efforts with Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers. The main point of contact for marketing engagements and offer listing content, such as product descriptions, images, and videos. |
    | *Partner sales* | This role focuses on selling your solution and collaborating on sales with Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers. For co-sell solutions, please indicate at least one partner sales contact per region in which you wish to be Co-sell Ready. The same partner sales contact may cover multiple regions. |
    | *Partner technical sales* | Supports technical architecture and deployment considerations during the sales cycle, the post-sales integration, and deployment periods. |
    | *Partner customer success manager* | Typically supports customers post-deployment, to help them get the most out of your solution and grow its footprint within the customer’s organization. |

* *Countries/Regions:* (Required) When filling out the template, use the two letter country codes as listed below. If the contact covers all Countries/Regions use the three letter code “OOO”. If a contact covers more than one Country/Region enter each of the two letter codes separated by a comma (for example, enter “US, CA, FR” without quotation marks into the template)

    The countries/regions should reflect each contact’s territory. Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers will utilize this information for requesting information or collaborating on sales within the specific Country/Region.
