# How to create a Commercial Marketplace account in Partner Center

In order to publish offers to Azure Marketplace or AppSource, you'll need to create a Partner Center account.  

In this article, we'll dive into how to create and manage a Partner Center account, including how to: 

- Set up your account profile 
- Review account guidelines, terms, and conditions 
- Add payment information 
- Add tax information

## Before you begin

To create an account on Partner Center, you’ll need to have on hand the following information. You may want to take a few minutes to gather these items before you get started:

-   Global administrator work email. If you're not sure what your company's work account is, see [Your company work account and Partner Center](azure-active-directory-tenants-and-partner-center.md).

    If your company doesn’t have a work account, you can create one during the account creation process. 

-   Your company’s legal business name, address, and primary contact. We need this information to confirm that your company has an established profile and that you are authorized to act on its behalf. 

-   Authority to sign legal agreements. Ensure that you are authorized to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf as you’ll be asked to do so during the enrollment process.

-   Name and company email of the person you want to act as your primary contact. To help ensure your company’s security and privacy, we’ll email your primary contact to verify that (1) he or she signed up for a Partner Center account, and that (2) this email address belongs to your company. After the primary contact verifies his or her email address, we’ll continue our review of the information you provided.

We’ll verify this information during the account creation process.

## Create a Partner Center account

1.	Review the information on the **Welcome** page and then select **Next**.

2.	Sign in as a global admin to your company's work account. If you're not sure what your company's work account is, see [Your company work account and Partner Center](azure-active-directory-tenants-and-partner-center.md).

    Select **Sign in** if you know your company has a work email account. On the next page, enter global admin credentials for your company's work account. 

    If your company doesn’t have a work account, select **Create one** to set one up now. After creating a work account, sign in using the global admin credentials for the work account you just created.

3.	Provide or update your company’s legal business profile and primary contact information and then select **Enroll now**. 

    The primary contact should be the person in your company we can contact about your application (this can be you or another person in your company). We'll also use this information to verify that this person works at your company and has signed up for a Partner Center account.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > To help ensure your company’s security and privacy, we’ll email your primary contact to verify that (1) he or she signed up for a Partner Center account, and (2) that this email address belongs to your company.
