# Ratings and reviews dashboard in Commercial Marketplace analytics

This article provides information on the Ratings & reviews dashboard in Partner Center. This dashboard displays a consolidated view of customer feedback for offers on Azure Marketplace and AppSource.

To access the **Ratings & reviews dashboard** in the Partner Center analytics tools, open the **[Analyze](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/summary)** dashboard under Commercial Marketplace.

## Ratings & reviews

As customers browse, search, and purchase offers in both marketplaces, they can leave ratings and reviews for the offers they've acquired.

- Customers can submit a new rating or review and update or delete an existing rating or review they have submitted. Customers can make changes only to the ratings and reviews they own.  
- Reviews are posted on the Reviews tab on the product display page of the offer in Azure marketplace or AppSource. Customers can include their name or post anonymously.  

The **Ratings & review dashboard** displays the trends and insights of this activity by customers. You can view a graphical representation of the following items:

- Ratings & reviews  
- Review comments

The **Marketplace storefront tabs** allow publishers to view their offer metrics separately in the AppSource & Azure Marketplace tabs. To view specific offer metrics, select the offer from the offer dropdown list.


### Ratings and reviews summary

The ratings & reviews summary section displays the metrics below for a selectedâ€¯date range:

- **Average rating:** Weighted average star rating of all the ratings submitted by customers for the selected offer.
- **Rating breakdown:** Breakdown of star rating by the count of customers who submitted ratings. The bar chart is stacked with actual and revised ratings (updated rating count).
- **Total ratings:** Overall count of ratings submitted. This count also includes ratings with and without reviews.
- **Ratings with reviews:** Count of reviews submitted.
