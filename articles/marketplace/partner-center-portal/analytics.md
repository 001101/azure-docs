As a partner, you can monitor your offer listings using the data visualization and insight graphs supported by Partner Center and find ways to maximize your sales. The improved analytics tools enable you to act on performance results and maintain better relationships with your customers and resellers. 

To access the Partner Center analytics tools, open the **[Analyze](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/summary)** dashboard under Commercial Marketplace.

|[Orders](#orders-dashboard)|Information about your orders in a graphical and downloadable format|
|[Customers](#customers-dashboard)|Information about your customers, including growth trends, presented in a  graphical and downloadable format|
|[Downloads](#downloads-dashboard)|A list of your download requests over the last 30 days|
|[Analytics](#analytics-dashboard)|A summary of your marketplace web analytics and analysis of campaign performance|

The output of the **Summary** page graphs can be customized by selecting a date range based on the past 3, 6, or 12 months, or by selecting a custom date range with a maximum duration of 12 months. The default date range is 6 months.
