# Downloads Dashboard in Commercial Marketplace Analytics

This article provides information on the Downloads dashboard in Partner Center. This dashboard displays a list of your download requests over the last 30 days.

To access the Downloads dashboard, open the **[Analyze](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/summary)** dashboard under Commercial Marketplace.

## Downloads dashboard

The **Downloads** dashboard of the **Analyze** menu displays requests for any downloads that contain over 1000 rows of customer or order data.

You will receive a pop-up notification and email containing a link to the **Downloads** dashboard whenever you request a download with over 1000 rows of data. These data downloads will be available for a 30-day period and then removed.
