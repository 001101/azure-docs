Optionally, select up to two industries and two verticals under each industry. These are used as search filters in the Storefront to display your offer. If your offer targets a specific industry and/or vertical, use the offer description to explain how your offer supports the selected industries or verticals. If your offer isn't industry-specific, leave this section blank.

See the full list of industries and verticals in [Offer Listing Best Practices](../gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md).
