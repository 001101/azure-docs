You can optionally select up to two industries and two sub-industries for each industry. These are used for grouping your offer into the appropriate marketplace search areas. If your offer is not specific to an industry, leave this section blank. Be sure to call out how your offer supports the selected industries in the offer description.

>[!NOTE]
>We are in the process of introducing new industry taxonomy to the marketplace. You may not see all the taxonomy available in Partner Center. \* denotes industries not yet available in the marketplace. We are working on having consistent taxonomy across all portals, meanwhile your offer will still be discoverable in the marketplace under the existing industries. Your offer will also still be discoverable via keyword search in the marketplace.
