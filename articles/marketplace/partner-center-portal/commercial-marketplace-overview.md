# Overview of the Commercial Marketplace portal in Partner Center

Welcome to the Commercial Marketplace portal in Microsoft Partner Center. The [Commercial Marketplace in Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/) is designed to help you monetize your products and services, reach customers, and grow your business.

In this documentation, we will cover the basics of creating and using your Partner Center account, managing your existing SaaS offers, creating new SaaS offers that can be listed on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) or [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), and providing resources to assist you with questions and to collect your feedback. 

## About Microsoft's Commercial Marketplace

Enterprises, governments, and organizations of all sizes find business solutions, innovative technology, and enablement services through the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) and [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) web stores, [Azure portal’s in-product experience](https://ms.portal.azure.com), [Cloud Solution Providers](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider), and Microsoft Sales teams. 

Partner Center is the hub of a Microsoft partner’s experience. For organizations who go to market with Microsoft and leverage the marketplace, Partner Center is the portal through which publishers create and manage offerings, as well as view analytics on offer performance. 

## Migration from Cloud Partner Portal

Partner Center is evolving to better integrate all aspects of Microsoft’s relationship with software publishers. As part of this evolution, we are migrating the functions of the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) to Partner Center. 

**Currently, Partner Center only supports the creation and management of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offers.**

Existing marketplace publishers will find a familiar but improved user experience with an intuitive interface. Notifications in the portal and via email will inform publishers of the migration, users will be seamlessly directed to the appropriate location, and customers will not be impacted by the partner experience upgrade. 

With the transition to Partner Center, new functionality is available to publishers, in addition to improvements on the user experience. SaaS offerings, which can be billed monthly or annually, supports per-user licensing in addition to per-site. This new monetization model is ideal for business software and the introduction of SaaS per-user licensing aligns with new functionality allowing customers to complete purchases in AppSource, Microsoft’s commercial marketplace for business and industry solutions. 

Account and user management in Partner Center make it easy for individuals to access the portal and for administrators to apply appropriate permissions. Compared to prior offer management portals, the role-based access control capabilities in Partner Center provide security enhancements that will make the publishing process simpler for large organizations. 

Analytics provide a view into offer performance, and the reporting is also improved in Partner Center. With data visualization and insightful graphs, publishers can monitor sales, act on performance to optimize listings, and maintain relationships with customers and resellers.
