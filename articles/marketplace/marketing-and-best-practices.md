# Test drive marketing and best practices

Azure Marketplace test drive is a great tool for marketers. We recommend you incorporate it in your go-to-market efforts when you launch to generate more leads for your business.

## Best practices

- **Referral page** – Post a page on your web presence that talks all about your Azure test drive and post multiple referral links directing traffic to your test drive.
- **Social media** – Create a schedule where you post on your social media channels about your test drive on a regular basis.
- **Blogs** – Write a blog post about your Azure test drive. Highlight the features and benefits the user will get to experience free of charge and in very little time. Link to your Azure test drive page in multiple places in the blog copy. Post links to your blog post on your social media channels.
- **Email nurturing** – Inform leads that have engaged with your brand via other channels over email to inform them about the test drive and encourage them to try it out for free.
- **Sales training and tools** – Set up a training session with your sales teams to demo the test drive experience and develop a few ways they can engage their leads and customers with it. Sales folks can set up a demo with multiple contacts at a company, then send each of them the link to the test drive afterwards to try it themselves.
- **Trade shows and conferences** – Got a booth at an industry event? Set up a few laptops with test drives your prospective customers can try out, then talk to them about the product during and after their experience.

## Lead management

Now that you're generating highly qualified leads from test drive, you'll want to ensure you have incorporated these leads into your sales and marketing channels and you engage with prospects to turn them into paying customers. Here are some recommendations for driving leads through your sales cycle:

- Make contact with the lead within 24 hours of them taking the test drive. You will get the lead in your CRM of choice immediately after the customer deploys the test drive; be sure to send them an email within the first 24 hours while they are still warm. Request scheduling a phone call with them to better understand if your product is a good solution for their problem.
- Follow up a couple of times, but don't bombard them. We recommend you email these lead a few times before you close them out, but don't give up after the first attempt. Remember, these customers directly engaged with your product and spent time in a free trial. They are great prospects!
- If you close a deal with a test drive lead, be sure to register it at Partner sales connect. Also, we would love to hear about your customer wins where test drive played a role! <!-- HOW? AND WHERE IS SALES CONNECT? -->
