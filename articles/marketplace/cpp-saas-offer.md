# Azure SaaS application offer

The [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) no longer supports the creation and management of SaaS application offers.  Instead, this functionality has been moved to the Microsoft [Partner Center portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/).  For more information, see [Create a new SaaS offer](create-new-saas-offer.md). 


## Next steps

Before you create a new SaaS app offer, you should read [Plan a SaaS offer for the commercial marketplace](plan-saas-offer.md).
