# Configure your SaaS offer listing details

The information you provide on the **Offer listing** page for your software as a service (SaaS) offer will be displayed in the Microsoft commercial marketplace storefronts. This includes the descriptions of your offer, screenshots, and your marketing assets.

> [!NOTE]
> Offer listing content is not required to be in English if the offer description begins with the phrase, "This application is available only in [non-English language]." It is also acceptable to provide a *Useful Link URL* to offer content in a language other than the one used in the Offer listing content.

## Marketplace details

On the **Offer listing** page, under **Marketplace details**, complete the following steps. To learn more about these required details, see [Offer listing details](plan-saas-offer.md#offer-listing-details).

> [!NOTE]
> The following information is required unless otherwise noted.

1. The **Name** box is prefilled with the name you entered earlier in the  **New offer** dialog box. You can change the name at any time.
2. In the **Search results summary** box, enter up to 50 characters of text. This summary is used in the marketplace listing search results.
3. In the **Description** box, enter a description for your offer. You can enter up to 3,000 characters of text in this box, which includes HTML markup and spaces.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Use the rich text editor controls to make your description more engaging. You can also use HTML tags to format your description. Most tags require both opening and closing tags. For information about HTML formatting, see [HTML tags supported in the commercial marketplace offer descriptions](supported-html-tags.md).

4. In the **Getting started instructions** box, provide instructions to help customers connect to your SaaS offer. You can add up to 3,000 characters of text and links to more detailed online documentation.
5. (Optional) In the **Search keywords** boxes, enter up to three search keywords that customers can use to find your offer in the marketplace.

    > [!TIP]
    > The text you enter in the **Name** and **Description** boxes are automatically included in search.

1. In the **Privacy policy link** box, enter a link (starting with https) to your organization's privacy policy. You're responsible to ensure your app complies with privacy laws and regulations, and for providing a valid privacy policy.

## Add links to supplemental online documentation (optional)

## Enter your contact information

Under **Contact information**, provide information for the following contacts:

   > [!NOTE]
   > CSP extends your offer to a broader range of qualified customers by enabling CSP partners to bundle, market, and resell your offer. These resellers will need access to materials for marketing your offer. For more information, see [Go-To-Market Services](https://partner.microsoft.com/reach-customers/gtm).

## Add marketing documents

You must add at least one and a maximum of three marketing documents for your offer. These documents must be in PDF format.
