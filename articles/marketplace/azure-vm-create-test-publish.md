# Test and publish a virtual machine offer on Azure Marketplace

After you've completed all the required sections of the offer, you can submit it for review and publication.

At the upper right, select **Review and publish**.

On this pane you can:

- View the completion status for each section of the offer:

  - **Not started**: The section has not been started and needs to be completed.
  - **Incomplete**: The section has errors that must be fixed or requires that you provide more information. For guidance about updating the incomplete information, see this article's earlier sections.
  - **Complete**: The section is complete and there are no errors. All sections of the offer must be complete before you can submit the offer.
- Provide **Notes for certification** to the certification team to help ensure that your application is tested correctly. Include testing instructions and any supplementary notes that can help the team understand your application.

To submit the offer for publishing, select **Review and publish**.

Microsoft will send an email message to let you know when a preview version of the offer is available to review and approve. To publish your offer to the public (or, if it's a private offer, publish it to a private audience), go to Partner Center, go to your offer's **Overview** page, and then select **Go-live**. The status of your offer appears at the top of the page when publishing is in progress.

## Errors and review feedback

The **Manual validation** step in the publishing process represents an extensive review of your offer and its associated technical assets. If this process uncovers errors with your offer, you'll receive a certification report that details the issues. Simply make the required corrections and republish your offer.

## Offer overview

The **Offer overview** page shows a visual representation of the steps, both completed and in progress, that are required to publish your offer and the length of time each step should take to complete.

This page also includes links to help you work with the offer, depending on its status:

- If the offer is a draft: [Delete draft offer](partner-center-portal/update-existing-offer.md#delete-a-draft-offer)
- If the offer is live: [Stop selling the offer](partner-center-portal/update-existing-offer.md#stop-selling-an-offer-or-plan)
- If the offer is in preview: **Go-live** (publishing-status.md#publisher-approval link invalid)
- If you haven't completed publisher sign-out: [Cancel publishing](partner-center-portal/update-existing-offer.md#cancel-publishing)
