# Market your virtual machine offer (ALL FROM SaaS)

This article describes additional marketing options you can choose if youâ€™re selling your software as a service (SaaS) offer through Microsoft. You can co-sell your offer with Microsoft, resell it through the [Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) program](cloud-solution-providers.md), or both.

## Co-sell with Microsoft

Providing information on the **Co-sell with Microsoft** page is entirely optional. But it's required to achieve _Co-sell Ready_ and _IP Co-sell Ready_ status. The Microsoft sales teams use this information to learn more about your solution when evaluating its fit for customer needs. The information you provide on this tab isn't available directly to customers.

For details and instructions to configure the **Co-sell with Microsoft** tab, see [Co-sell option in Partner Center](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-co-sell.md).

## Resell through CSPs

If you elect to make your offer available in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, CSPs can sell your product as part of a bundled solution to their customers. For more information about reselling your offer through the CSP program and step-by-step instructions to configure the **Resell through CSPs** tab, see [Cloud Solution Provider program](cloud-solution-providers.md).
