Simplified Currency Pricing
---------------------------

Starting September 2018, a new section called **Simplified Currency
Pricing** would be visible to you. Microsoft is streamlining the Azure
Marketplace business by enabling more predictable pricing and collections from
your customers across the world. This streamlining will be achieved by reducing the number of
currencies in which we invoice your customers.

The new section will take pricing in these new currencies. Once all customers
have been migrated to these new settlement currencies, the original pricing
section will be retired and only the “Simplified Currency Pricing” section will
remain.

You will have until November 1, 2018 to set a new price for the regions wherein the
settlement currency is changing. You will not be able to increase the price for
regions wherein the settlement currency is not changing. The following are the
regions wherein the currency is changing:
