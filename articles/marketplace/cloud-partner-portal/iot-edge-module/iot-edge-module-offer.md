# IoT Edge offer

The [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) no longer supports the creation and management of IoT Edge module offers. This functionality has been moved to Microsoft [Partner Center portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/). For more information, see [Create, configure, and publish an IoT Edge module offer in Azure Marketplace](../../partner-center-portal/azure-iot-edge-module-creation.md).

## Next steps

Before starting, [Create a Commercial Marketplace account in Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account) if you haven't done so yet. Ensure your account is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program. Then review the Partner Center portal steps listed in the [Offer creation checklist](../../partner-center-portal/offer-creation-checklist.md).
