# Microsoft Business Applications Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Program onboarding guide

The [Business Applications ISV Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/isv-overview) aims to accelerate the growth and overall success of Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) building modern, cloud-based, line-of-business (LOB) solutions with *Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement* (Dynamics CE) or *Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations* (Dynamics Ops). Here's how to be part of it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Existing ISV partners with *Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement* and *Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations* applications will have until **October 15, 2019** to complete the all onboarding steps listed below. ISVs who have not completed these steps by that time will have existing offers removed from [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com).

In order to enroll and take advantage of all the [technical, marketing, and sales enablement benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/business-applications/isv-overview) of the Business Applications ISV Program, we're asking existing ISV partners (with *Dynamics CE* and *Ops* offers) to complete several prerequisites explained in this guide. These steps include: 

 - [Setting up your account](#set-up-your-microsoft-partner-center-account) for Microsoft Partner Center
 - [Signing the agreement](#sign-the-business-applications-isv-program-agreement) for the Business Applications ISV Program
 - [Specifying your billing info](#set-up-your-billing-information), and
 - [Republishing your application](#recertify-your-application) to Microsoft AppSource

 **You'll need to complete all of the above steps in order to make changes to an existing offer (your offers will be locked for editing in *Cloud Partner Portal* until then).**

In the past, Microsoft lacked a way for customers to easily assess whether an ISV application built on
the platform would meet a given quality bar. When you follow these steps to enroll in the Microsoft Business Applications ISV Program, your application is certified and promoted by Microsoft as part of the official ISV ecosystem.

## Set up your Microsoft Partner Center account

[Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com) is the place to manage your account settings for the new Business Applications ISV Program.

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires an *Owner* role in Cloud Partner Portal for your given account.

If you've already published Dynamics CE and/or Dynamics Ops offers, most likely your Cloud Partner Portal (CPP) account has already been migrated and activated on Microsoft Partner Center. If not, you can manually activate your Partner Center account from your CPP Publisher Profile.

1. Sign in to your *Publisher Profile* page from [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/).

2. If you see a banner showing that your account settings have been migrated to Partner Center, continue on to the next section. Otherwise, click on the yellow banner prompting you to activate your Partner Center account.

For more info, see [*Account migration from Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center*](../partner-center-portal/account-migration-from-cpp-to-pc.md).

## Sign the Business Applications ISV Program agreement

Participation in this program requires you to review and accept the *Microsoft Business Applications ISV Addendum* agreement.

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires an *Owner* or *Manager* role in Partner Center for your given account in order to sign legal agreements. If you completed your Cloud Partner Portal account migration by [activating your Partner Center account](#set-up-your-microsoft-partner-center-account) in the previous step, your permissions have also migrated to Partner Center.

1. Go to https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/agreements (and sign in to Partner Center as prompted).

2. Under the heading *Commercial Marketplace*, locate **Microsoft Business Applications ISV Addendum** and click the link to review the agreement.

3. Click on *Accept Agreement* to sign the agreement.

## Set up your billing information

Next, set up your billing information for the Business Applications ISV Program.

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires an *Owner* or *Manager* role in Partner Center for your given account in order to update billing information.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).

2. Click on the *Settings* (gear) icon and select **Developer Settings**.

3. Under *Accounts*, click on **Billing profile**.

4. Review the primary contact and billing information that is populated from your legal entity, and click on the checkbox if you need to make updates.

5. (Optional) Supply Tax ID/VAT ID settings.

6. Save your changes on the form.

You can update your billing profile at any time, however *Company Name* and billing address *Country*  are not editable fields.

## Recertify your application

If you've complete the steps above, your existing Dynamics 365 CE and Dynamics 365 Ops offers are now unlocked for editing in the Cloud Partner Portal (you might need to refresh the page). You can also create new offers through the CPP.

The final step for enrollment in the Business Applications ISV Program is to recertify your existing applications.

1. [Follow the steps](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/isv-publish) to republish your application to AppSource.

2. [Create and publish a new offer](manage-offers/cpp-manage-offers.md) to Cloud Partner Portal. This will be an entirely new offer, and not intended to replace the existing one.
