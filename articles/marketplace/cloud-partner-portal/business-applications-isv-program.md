# Microsoft Business Applications Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Connect Program onboarding guide

The [Business Applications ISV Connect Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/isv-overview) aims to accelerate the growth and overall success of Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) building modern, cloud-based, line-of-business (LOB) solutions with *Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement and PowerApps* ("Dynamics CE offers") or *Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations* ("Dynamics Ops offers"). Here's how to be part of it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Existing ISV partners with *Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement*, *Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations*, and *PowerApps* applications should complete all onboarding steps below before **October 15, 2019** to avoid having their existing offers removed from [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com).

In order to enroll and take advantage of all the [technical, marketing, and sales enablement benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/isv-overview) of the Business Applications ISV Connect Program, we're asking existing ISV partners (with *Dynamics CE* and *Ops* offers) to complete the following steps:

- [Set up your Microsoft Partner Center account](#set-up-your-microsoft-partner-center-account).
- [Accept the Business Applications Addendum](#accept-the-business-applications-isv-program-addendum).
- [Set up your billing info](#set-up-your-billing-information).
- [Recertify your application](#recertify-your-application).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll need to complete all the above steps before publishing changes to an existing offer.

## Accept the Business Applications ISV Program addendum

Participation in this program requires you to review and accept the *Business Applications Addendum*.

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires an *Owner* or *Manager* role in Partner Center for your  account to sign legal agreements. If you completed your Cloud Partner Portal account migration by [activating your Partner Center account](#set-up-your-microsoft-partner-center-account) in the previous step, your permissions have also migrated to Partner Center.

1. Go to [the Partner Center Dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/agreements) and sign in to Partner Center as prompted.

2. Under the heading **Commercial Marketplace**, locate **Microsoft Business Applications ISV Addendum**.

3. Select the version link and view the agreement.

4. Select **Accept Agreement** to agree to and accept the agreement.

## Set up your billing information

Next, set up your billing information for the Business Applications ISV Connect Program.

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires an *Owner* or *Manager* role in Partner Center for your account to update billing information.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).

2. Select the *Settings* (gear) icon and select **Developer Settings**.

3. Under *Accounts*, select **Billing profile**.

4. Review the primary contact and billing information that is populated from your legal entity, and make any necessary updates.

5. Supply Tax ID/VAT ID settings, if applicable.

6. Select **Save** to save your changes.

You can update your billing profile at any time, however *Company Name* and billing address *Country* cannot be changed later.

## Recertify your application

After you've completed the steps above, your existing Dynamics CE and Dynamics Ops offers will be available for editing in Partner Center. You can also create new offers through Partner Center.

The final step for enrollment in the Business Applications ISV Connect program is recertifying your existing applications.

1. [Follow the steps](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/business-applications/isv-publish) to recertify your application to AppSource.
2. [Create and publish a new offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-customer-engagement-offer). This will be an entirely new offer, and does not replace an existing one.
