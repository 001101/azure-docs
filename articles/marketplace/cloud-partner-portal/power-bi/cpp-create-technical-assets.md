# Create Power BI App technical assets

The primary technical asset you will need for this offer type is a Power BI App, which is a collection of primary datasets, reports or dashboards, and optional connected services and embedded datasets. Power BI App is an evolution of an asset type previously known as [content packs](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-organizational-content-pack-introduction). For more information about developing this type of app, see [What are Power BI template apps?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636).


## Obtain an installation URL

You can build a Power BI App only within the [Power BI service](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). To begin, you sign in with a [Power BI Pro license](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro). After you create and test your service application in Power BI, you save the app installation URL that Power BI generates. Finally, you supply the URL on the [Technical Info](./cpp-technical-info-tab.md) tab of the Cloud Partner Portal submission form.
â€ƒ

## Next steps

After you've created and tested your Power BI App and you've created the associated offer, you can [publish the Power BI offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md).
