# Power BI app offer

|              |                                |
|-|--------------------------------|
| This section explains how to publish a Power BI app to the Microsoft [AppSource marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). A Power BI app packages Power BI content and uses dataflows to connect reports and dashboards to data in common data storage. The app can be then deployed to other tenants via AppSource. | ![Power BI icon](./media/powerbi-icon.png) |


This section is divided into these main parts:

-   [Prerequisites](./cpp-prerequisites.md). The technical and business requirements for creating and publishing a Power BI app offer.
-   [Create a Power BI app offer](./cpp-create-offer.md). How to create a Power BI app offer entry by using the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com).
-   [Publish a Power BI app offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md). How to submit a new offer to AppSource for publishing, and how to update an existing offer.


## Publishing steps

These are the high-level steps for publishing a Power BI app offer:

This is the Power BI apps publishing process:

1. Create a service application in Power BI. This generates a package installation URL, which represents the technical assets for the offer. For more information, see [What is Power BI?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636).
2. Collect or create the business assets, including:
    - Marketing materials.
    - Legal and support documents.
3.  Create the offer. Use the Cloud Partner Portal to configure the details of the offer, including the offer description, marketing materials, legal information, support information, and asset specifications.
4.  Certify and publish the offer. This starts the publishing process.
    - The AppSource onboarding team tests, validates, and certifies your application. 
    - After the offer is certified, review it in its test environment and release it.

After all these steps are performed, your app will go live on AppSource.

## Next steps

Before you begin these steps, you must meet the [requirements](./cpp-prerequisites.md) for publishing a Power BI app to AppSource.
