# API support in Azure Static Web Apps with Azure Functions

Azure Static Web Apps provides serverless API endpoints via [Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md). By leveraging Azure Functions, APIs dynamically scale based on demand, and include the following features:

- **Integrated security** with direct access to [user authentication data](user-information.md).
- **Seamless routing** that makes the _api_ route available to the web app without requiring custom CORS rules.
- **Azure Functions v3.x** running Node.js 12.x.
- **HTTP triggers** and output bindings.

## Configuration

API endpoints are available to the web app through the _api_ route. While this route is fixed, you have control over name and location of the associated Azure Functions app. You can change this location by editing the workflow YAML file located in your repository's _.github/workflows_ folder. Set the `jobs > steps > with > api_location` value to the desired folder location for the API app in your repository.

## Constraints

- The API route prefix is must be _api_.
- Triggers and bindings are limited to [HTTP](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook.md).
  - All other [Azure Functions triggers and bindings](../azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings.md) are restricted.
