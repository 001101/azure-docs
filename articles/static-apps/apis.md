# API support in Azure Static Web Apps with Azure Functions

Azure Static Web Apps provides serverless API endpoints via [Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md). By leveraging Azure Functions, APIs dynamically scale based on demand and include the following features:

- **Integrated security** with direct access to [user authentication data](user-information.md).
- **Seamless relative access** making _api_ route  available to the web app without requiring custom CORS rules.
- **Azure Functions v3.x** running Node 12.x.
- **HTTP triggers** and output bindings.

## Constraints

- The API route prefix is fixed at _api_.
- Triggers and bindings are limited to [HTTP](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook).
  - All other [Azure Functions triggers and bindings](../azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings) are restricted
