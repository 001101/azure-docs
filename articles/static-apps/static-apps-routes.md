# Routes in App Service Static Apps

Introductory paragraph.

<!---Required:
Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what the customer will learn, or do, or accomplish. Answer the fundamental "why would I want to do this?" question.
--->

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

## Prerequisites

- First prerequisite
- Second prerequisite
- Third prerequisite
<!--- Make Prerequisites your first H2 if you have them.
If there's something a customer needs to take care of before they start (for example, creating a VM) it's OK to link to that content before they begin.

## <section>

<!---Detail what the reader needs to know in each section

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.

      <!---Use screenshots but be judicious to maintain a reasonable length. Make sure screenshots align to the [current standards](contribute-mvc-screen-shots.md).
      If users access your product/service via a web browser the first screenshot should always include the full browser window in Chrome or Safari. This is to show users that the portal is browser-based - OS and browser agnostic.--->
