# Azure Red Hat OpenShift troubleshooting

This article details some common problems encountered while creating or managing Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters.

## Retrying the creation of a failed Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster

If creating a cluster using the `az` CLI command fails, retrying creation will always fail. 
Use `az openshift delete` to delete the failed cluster. Then create an entirely new cluster.

## Untrusted Azure Red Hat OpenShift server certificate

Currently, the OpenShift console certificate is untrusted. When you navigate to the console, manually accept the untrusted certificate from your browser.

## Hidden Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster resource group

Currently, the `Microsoft.ContainerService/openShiftManagedClusters` resource created by the `az` CLI is hidden in the Azure portal. In the `Resource group` view, check `Show hidden types` to view the resource group.
