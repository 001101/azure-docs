# Tutorial: Delete an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster

This is the end of the tutorial. When you are done with the resources you have created, delete your cluster and associated resources so that you are not charged for resources you're no longer using.

In part three of the series, you learn how to:

> * [Scale an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](tutorial-scale-cluster.md)
> * Delete an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial:

* Create a cluster by following the [Create an ARO cluster](tutorial-create-cluster.md) tutorial.

## Step 1: Sign in to Azure

If you're running the Azure CLI locally, run `az login` to sign in to Azure.

```bash
az login
```

If you have access to multiple subscriptions, run `az account set -s
SUBSCRIPTION_ID` to default to the correct subscription.

## Step 2: Delete the cluster

Using the CLI command `az openshift delete <cluster name>` to delete the cluster.

## Step 3: Delete resources associated with the cluster

To clean up all resources associated with the cluster, you must delete the resource group that you specified when you created the cluster.  Which will also delete all of the other related resources that get created when you build an ARO cluster.

Currently, the `Microsoft.ContainerService/openShiftManagedClusters` resource that is created when you create the cluster is hidden in the Azure portal. In the `Resource group` view, check `Show hidden types` to view the resource group.

Or, you can run `az openshift list` to output the resource groups. Note the name of the resource group that you specified when you created the ARO cluster.

Delete the resource group with `az group delete --name <ARO cluster resource group name>`  The process will take a few minutes, and at the end the entire Resource Group and all resources inside it will be deleted.
