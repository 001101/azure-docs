# Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster support policy

This article outlines configuration requirements for Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 clusters in order to maintain cluster supportability. In the Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 service, cluster administrators are able to modify internal cluster components. Modifications must be made within the policy outlined in this document in order to maintain support from Microsoft and Red Hat.

> [!NOTE]
> Features marked Technology Preview in OpenShift Container Platform are not supported in Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

## Cluster configuration requirements

* All OpenShift Cluster operators must remain in a managed state. The list of cluster operators can be returned by running 'oc get clusteroperators'.
* The cluster Prometheus and Alertmanager services must not be removed or modified.  Service Alertmanager rules must not be removed.
* The ARO service sets the OpenShift cluster version.  It must not be modified.
* ARO service logging (mdsd pods) must not be removed or modified.
* The 'arosvc.azurecr.io' cluster pull secret must not be removed or modified.
* All cluster virtual machines must have outbound internet access, at least to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and service logging (Geneva) endpoints.
* The ARO service accesses your cluster via Private Link Service.  Service access must not be removed or modified.
* Non-RHCOS compute nodes are not supported. For example, you cannot use a RHEL compute node.
