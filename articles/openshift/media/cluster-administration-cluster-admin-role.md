# Azure Red Hat OpenShift customer administrator role

As an ARO (Azure Red Hat OpenShift) cluster administrator of an OpenShift cluster, your account has increased permissions and access to all user-created projects.

When your account has the osa-customer-admins authorization role bound to it, can automatically manage project

    Note: osa-customer-admin clusterrole is not the same as cluster-admin clusterrole

You can perform actions associated with a set of verbs (e.g., create) to operate on a set of resource names (e.g., templates). To view the details of these roles and their sets of verbs and resources, run the following:

$ oc describe clusterrole/osa-customer-admin

The verb names do not necessarily all map directly to oc commands, but rather equate more generally to the types of CLI operations you can perform. For example, having the list verb means that you can display a list of all objects of a given resource name (e.g., using oc get), while get means that you can display the details of a specific object if you know its name (e.g., using oc describe).

## How to configure customer administrator role

Customer administrator role can be configured only during cluster creation by providing flag `--customer-admin-group-id`.
