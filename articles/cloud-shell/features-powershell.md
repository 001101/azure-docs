# Features and tools for PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell

[!include [features-introblock](../../includes/cloud-shell-features-introblock.md)]

> [!TIP]
> [Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](features.md) is also available.

PowerShell in Cloud Shell runs on `Windows Server 2016`.

## Features

### Secure automatic authentication

PowerShell in Cloud Shell securely and automatically authenticates account access for the Azure PowerShell.

### Files persistence across sessions

To persist files across sessions, Cloud Shell walks you through attaching an Azure file share on first launch.
Once completed, Cloud Shell will automatically attach your storage (mount as `$home\clouddrive`) for all future sessions.
Since, each request for Cloud Shell is allocating a temporary machine, files outside of your `$home\clouddrive` and machine state are not persisted across sessions.

### Azure drive (Azure:)

PowerShell in Cloud Shell starts you in Azure drive (`Azure:`). Azure drive enables easy discovery and navigation of Azure resources such as Compute, Network, Storage etc. similar to filesystem navigation. You can continue to use the familiar [Azure PowerShell cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure) to manage these resources. Any changes made to the Azure resources, either made directly in Azure portal or through Azure PowerShell cmdlets, are instantly reflected in the Azure drive.

#### Contextual awareness

- **Resource group name**: When under a resource group in the Azure drive (`Azure:`), the resource group name is automatically passed to the Azure PowerShell cmdlets.

- **Get-AzureRmCommand**: This cmdlet returns the list of commands applicable in the context of the location under Azure drive (`Azure:`). For example, it shows only storage related commands when user is under `Azure:\<subscription name>\StorageAccounts`

### Extensible model

To import additional cmdlets and ability to run any executable.
