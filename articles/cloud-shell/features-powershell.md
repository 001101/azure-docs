# Features and tools for PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell

[!include [features-introblock](../../includes/cloud-shell-features-introblock.md)]

> [!TIP]
> [Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](features.md) is also available.

PowerShell in Cloud Shell runs on `Windows Server 2016`.

## Features

### Secure automatic authentication

PowerShell in Cloud Shell securely and automatically authenticates account access for the Azure PowerShell.

### Azure Files persistence

To persist files across sessions, Cloud Shell walks you through attaching an Azure file share on first launch.
Once completed, Cloud Shell will automatically attach your storage (mount as `$home\clouddrive`) for all future sessions.
Since Cloud Shell is allocated on a per-request basis using a temporary machine, files outside of your `$home\clouddrive` and machine state are not persisted across sessions.

### Azure namespace

Capability to let you easily discover and navigate all Azure resources.
