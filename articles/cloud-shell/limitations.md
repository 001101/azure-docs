# Limitations of Azure Cloud Shell
Azure Cloud Shell has the following known limitations:

## System state and persistence
The machine that provides your Cloud Shell session is temporary, and it is recycled after your session is inactive for 20 minutes. Cloud Shell requires a file share to be mounted. As a result, your subscription must be able to set up storage resources to access Cloud Shell. Other considerations include:
* With mounted storage, only modifications within your `$Home` directory or `clouddrive` directory are persisted.
* File shares can be mounted only from within your [assigned region](persisting-shell-storage.md#mount-a-new-clouddrive).
* Azure Files supports only locally redundant storage and geo-redundant storage accounts.

## User permissions
Permissions are set as regular users without sudo access. Any installation outside your `$Home` directory will not persist.
Although certain commands within the `clouddrive` directory, such as `git clone`, do not have proper permissions, your `$Home` directory does have permissions.

## Browser support
Cloud Shell supports the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. Safari in private mode is not supported.

## Copy and paste
Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V do not function as copy/paste shortcuts in Cloud Shell on Windows machines, use Ctrl+Insert and Shift+Insert to copy and paste respectively.

Right-click copy-and-paste options are also available, but right-click function is subject to browser-specific clipboard access. 


## Bash Specific Limitations
### Editing .bashrc
Take caution when editing .bashrc, doing so can cause unexpected errors in Cloud Shell. 

### .bash_history
Your history of bash commands may be inconsistent because of Cloud Shell session disruption or concurrent sessions.

## PowerShell Specific Limitations
### Startup time can be long
  - **Details**: PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell could take up to 60 seconds to initialize.
  - **Workaround**: None. This is an issue we are working to address.

### An error occurs during startup if your Cloud Shell storage account is already created in a region other than your current region. 
  - **Details**: This issue affects early Private Preview users who created storage when only the West US region was supported.
    If a storage account is already created in the West US region, but your shell now starts in another region, you might see an error at startup such as one of the following:
    * `Requesting a Cloud Shell..Sorry, something went wrong: {"code":"ServiceUnavailable","message":"Azure Cloud Shell is not available at this moment, please retry later."}`
    * `Requesting a Cloud Shell..Sorry, something went wrong: {"code":"InternalServerError","message":"Encountered an internal server error. The tracking id is '...'."}`

  - **Workaround**: To mount storage in your new region, untag the existing storage account and restart PowerShell in Cloud Shell. 
      1.	Log in into [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) directly (that is, without using our private preview link)
      2.	Launch the Cloud Shell (Bash)
          * If you have an active PowerShell session [you need to Restart Cloud Shell](#for-a-given-user-only-one-shell-can-be-active)
      3.	Wait for the prompt and run command `clouddrive unmount`
      > Note: Untagging the storage account doesn't remove any data and it will still exist in your subscription

      4.	Log back using [PowerShell Private Preview link](https://aka.ms/PSCloudPreview) and launch the Cloud Shell (PowerShell) 
      > Note: You will have to [Restart Cloud Shell](media/shell-recycle.png) for PowerShell instance

### An error about [MissingSubscriptionRegistration](media/storageRP-error.jpg) occurs during persistent storage creation
  - **Details**: The selected subscription does not have Storage RP registered.
  - **Resolution**: [Register your Storage resource provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-common-deployment-errors#noregisteredproviderfound)

### During first use initialization, an [Unknown Error](media/startup_unknown_error.jpg) occurs

  - **Details**: During first use, the console may hang and display the message, "Sorry, something went wrong: Unknown Error".
  - **Resolution**: There are two ways to resolve this issue.
    1. Refresh the web page using the browser's refresh button and re-open the console.
    1. Close the shell IFrame (the subwindow that appears after clicking on the shell button) and reopen the console.

### For a given user only one shell can be active
  - **Details**: If the user launches Bash shell first and shortly opens PowerShell, it would connect back to the Bash shell with blue background.
  Similarly, if the user launches PowerShell first and shortly opens Bash shell, it would connect back to PowerShell instance with black background.
  - **Workaround**: Restart the shell by clicking [Restart Cloud Shell](media/shell-recycle.png) in the shell IFrame (refreshing the browser tab does not work).

### Automatic Azure authentication limit
  - **Details**: The authentication is active only for an hour due to a limitation in processing the Azure authentication token.
  - **Workaround**: Restart the shell by clicking [Restart Cloud Shell](media/shell-recycle.png) in the shell IFrame (refreshing the browser tab does not work).

### Get-Help -online does not open the help page
  - **Details**: If a user types `Get-Help Find-Module -online`, one sees an error message such as:\
  `Starting a browser to display online Help failed. No program or browser is associated to open the URI http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398574.`
  - **Workaround**: Copy the url and open it manually on your browser.

### GUI applications are not supported
  - **Details**: If a user tries to launch a GUI app (for example, git clone a 2FA enabled private repo. It pops up a 2FA authentication dialog box), the console prompt does not return.
  - **Workaround**: `Ctrl+C` to exit the command.


## Usage limits
Cloud Shell is intended for interactive use cases. As a result, any long-running non-interactive sessions are ended without warning.

## Network connectivity
Any latency in Cloud Shell is subject to local internet connectivity, Cloud Shell continues to attempt to carry out any instructions sent.
