# Azure security baseline for Cloud Shell

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview) to Cloud
Shell. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Cloud Shell. **Controls** not applicable to Cloud
Shell have been excluded. To see how Cloud Shell completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Cloud Shell security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

**Guidance**: Customers may deploy Azure Cloud Shell into a customer owned Virtual Network.

When you deploy Azure Cloud Shell into a customer owned Virtual Network you must create or use an existing virtual network. Ensure that the chosen virtual network has a network security group applied to its subnets and network access controls configured specific to your application's trusted ports and sources.
