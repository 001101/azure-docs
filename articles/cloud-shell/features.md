# Features and Tools for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell

[!include [features-introblock](<features-introblock.md)]

> [!TIP]
> [PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell](features-powershell.md) is also available.

Bash in Cloud Shell runs on `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`.

## Features

### Secure automatic authentication

Bash in Cloud Shell securely and automatically authenticates account access for the Azure CLI 2.0.

### Automatic ssh key persistence
[TODO:]

### $Home persistence

To persist files across sessions, Cloud Shell walks you through attaching an Azure file share on first launch.
Once completed, Cloud Shell will automatically attach your storage (mounted as `$Home\clouddrive`) for all future sessions.
Additionally, the user's `$Home` is persisted as an .img in their file share.
Since Cloud Shell is allocated on a per-request basis using a temporary machine, files outside of your `$Home` and machine state are not persisted across sessions.
