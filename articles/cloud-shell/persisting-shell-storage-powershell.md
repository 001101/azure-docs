## How Cloud Shell works
Cloud Shell persists files through the following method: 
* Mounting your specified file share as `clouddrive` in your `$Home` directory for direct file-share interaction. `/Home/<User>/clouddrive` is mapped to `$home\clouddrive`.
 
## Supported storage regions
The Azure files must reside in the same region as the Cloud Shell machine that you're mounting them to. Cloud Shell machines exist in the following regions:
|Area|Region|
|---|---|
|Americas|East US, South Central US, West US|
|Europe|North Europe, West Europe|
|Asia Pacific|India Central, Southeast Asia|

## `Get-Clouddrive`
The `Get-Clouddrive` command retrieves the file share information currently mounted by the clouddrive in the Cloud Shell.

## Unmount `clouddrive`
You can unmount a file share that's mounted to Cloud Shell at any time. If the file share has been removed, you will be prompted to create and mount a new file share at the next session because Cloud Shell requires a mounted file share.

### `Dismount-Clouddrive`
The `Dismount-Clouddrive` command unmounts a file share from the current storage account. Dismounting the clouddrive will terminate the current session. The user will be prompted to create and mount a new file share during the next session.
