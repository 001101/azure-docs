# Migrate network resources from Azure Germany to global Azure

Most networking services don't support migration from Azure Germany to global Azure. However, you can connect your networks in both cloud environments by using a site-to-site VPN. 

The steps to setting up a site-to-site VPN between clouds are similar to deploying a site-to-site VPN between your on-premises network and Azure. Define a gateway in both clouds, and then tell the VPNs how to communicate with each other. [Create a site-to-site connection in the Azure portal](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) describes the steps you complete to deploy a site-to-site VPN. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. Define a virtual network.
1. Define address space.
1. Define subnets.
1. Define a gateway subnet.
1. Define a gateway for the Azure Virtual Network network.
1. Define a gateway for the local network (your local VPN device).
1. Configure a local VPN device.
1. Build the connection.

To connect vIrtual networks between global Azure and Azure Germany, repeat steps 1-5 for both environments. Connect the virtual networks in a final step. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. Complete steps 1-5 in the preceding procedure in global Azure.
1. Complete steps 1-5 in Azure Germany.
1. Complete step 6 in global Azure:
   - Enter the public IP address of the VPN gateway in Azure Germany.
1. Complete step 6 in Azure Germany:
   - Enter the public IP address of the VPN gateway in global Azure.
1. Skip step 7.
1. Complete step 8.

## Virtual network

Migration of virtual networks between Azure Germany and global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create new virtual networks in the target region and migrate resources into those virtual networks.

- [Planning virtual networks](../virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm.md)

## Network security groups

Migrating network security groups between Azure Germany and global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create new network security groups in the target region and apply the network security groups rules to the new application environment.

You can get the current configuration of any network security group from the portal or by using the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
$nsg=Get-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceName <nsg-name> -ResourceGroupName <resourcegroupname>
Get-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg
```
For more information, see these articles:

- [About network security groups](../virtual-network/security-overview.md)
- [Manage network security groups](../virtual-network/manage-network-security-group.md)

## ExpressRoute

Migrating an Azure ExpressRoute resource between Azure Germany and global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create new ExpressRoute circuits and a new ExpressRoute gateway in global Azure.

For more information, see these articles:

- [Create a new ExpressRoute gateway](../expressroute/expressroute-howto-add-gateway-portal-resource-manager.md)
- [ExpressRoute locations and service providers](../expressroute/expressroute-locations.md)
- [About virtual network gateways for ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md)

## VPN Gateway

Migrating Azure VPN Gateway between Azure Germany and global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create and configure a new instance of VPN Gateway in global Azure.

Collect information about your current VPN Gateway configuration by using the portal or by using PowerShell. There's a set of cmdlets starting with `Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway*`.

Don't forget to update your on-premise configuration and delete any existing rules for the old IP ranges once you updated your Azure network environment.

For more information, see these articles:

- [Create a site-to-site connection](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) .
- [Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/get-azurermvirtualnetworkgateway?view=azurermps-6.5.0) PowerShell cmdlets,
- Blog: [Create Site-to-Site connection](https://blogs.technet.microsoftcom/ralfwi/2017/02/02/connecting-clouds/) between Azure Germany and global Azure
 
## Application Gateway

Migrating Azure Application Gateway resources between Azure Germany and global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create and configure a new gateway in global Azure.

Collect information about your current gateway configuration by using the portal or by using PowerShell. There's a set of cmdlets starting with `Get-AzureRmApplicationGateway*`.

For more information, see these articles:

- [Create Application Gateway](../application-gateway/quick-create-portal.md)
- [Get-AzureRmApplicationGateway](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/get-azurermapplicationgateway?view=azurermps-6.5.0) PowerShell cmdlets

## DNS

To migrate your Azure DNS configuration from Azure Germany to global Azure, export the DNS zone file, and then import it under the new subscription. Currently, the only way to export the zone file is by using the Azure CLI.

After you sign in to your source subscription in Azure Germany, configure the Azure CLI to use Azure Resource Manager mode. Export the zone by running this command:

```azurecli
az network dns zone export -g <resource group> -n <zone name> -f <zone file name>
```

Example:

```azurecli
az network dns zone export -g "myresourcegroup" -n "contoso.com" -f "contoso.com.txt"
```

This command calls the Azure DNS service to export the zone "contoso.com" in the resource group "myresourcegroup". The output is stored as a BIND-compatible zone file in "contoso.com.txt" in the current folder.

When the export is finished, delete the NS records from the zone file. New NS records are created for the new region and subscription.

Now, sign in to your target environment, create a new resource group (or select an existing one), and import the previously created zone file:

```azurecli
az network dns zone import -g <resource group> -n <zone name> -f <zone file name>
```

When the zone has been imported, you must validate the zone by running the following command:

```azurecli
az network dns record-set list -g <resource group> -z <zone name>
```

When validation is finished, contact your domain registrar and redelegate the NS records. To get NS record information, run this command:

```azurecli
az network dns record-set ns list -g <resource group> -z --output json
```

- [Azure DNS import and export](../dns/dns-import-export.md)

## Network Watcher

Migrating Azure Network Watcher resources between Azure Germany and global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create and configure a new Network Watcher in global Azure. Afterward, compare results between the old and new environments.

For more information, see these articles:

- [Network security group flow logs](../network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal.md)
- [Connection Monitor](../network-watcher/connection-monitor.md)
- [Network Watcher overview](../network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview.md)

## Traffic Manager

Azure Traffic Manager can help you with a smooth migration. However, you can't migrate Traffic Manager profiles that you create in Azure Germany to global Azure. (During a migration, you migrate Traffic Manager endpoints to the target environment, so, you need to update the Traffic Manager profile anyway.)

You can define additional endpoints in the target environment by using Traffic Manager still running in the old environment. When Traffic Manager is running in the new environment, you can still define endpoints in the old environment that you haven't yet migrated. This scenario is known as [the Blue-Green scenario](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/blue-green-deployments-using-azure-traffic-manager/). The scenario is summarized in the following steps:

1. Create a new Traffic Manager profile in global Azure.
1. Define the endpoints in Azure Germany.
1. Change your DNS CNAME to the new Traffic Manager profile.
1. Turn off the old Traffic Manager profile.
1. For each endpoint in Azure Germany:
   1. Migrate the endpoint to global Azure.
   1. Change the Traffic Manager profile to use the new endpoint.

- [Create a Traffic Manager profile](../traffic-manager/traffic-manager-create-profile.md)

## Load Balancer

Migrating Azure Load Balancer resources between Azure Germany and global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create and configure a new load balancer in global Azure.
