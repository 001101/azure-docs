# Migrate security resources from Azure Germany to global Azure

This article has information that can help you migrate Azure security resources from Azure Germany to global Azure.

## Azure Active Directory

For information about migrating this service, see [Migration of identities](./germany-migration-identity.md#azure-active-directory).

## Key Vault

Some features of Azure Key Vault can't be migrated from Azure Germany to global Azure:

- Encryption keys
- Application secrets

### Encryption keys

Encryption keys can't be migrated. Create new keys in the target region and use them to protect the target resource (Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database). Then, securely migrate the data from the old region to the new region.

### Application secrets

Application secrets are certificates, storage account keys, and other application-related secrets. During a migration, you can complete one of the following actions:

- Create a new key vault in global Azure.
- Create new application secrets.
- Read the current secrets in Azure Germany, and then enter the value in the new vault.

```powershell
Get-AzureKeyVaultSecret -vaultname mysecrets -name Deploydefaultpw
```

For more information, see these articles:
- [KeyVault overview](../key-vault/key-vault-overview.md)
- [KeyVault PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/module/azurerm.keyvault/?view=azurermps-6.5.0)

## VPN Gateway

Migrating an instance of Azure VPN Gateway from Azure Germany to global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create and configure a new instance of VPN Gateway in global Azure.

Collect information about your current VPN Gateway configuration by using the Azure portal or Azure PowerShell. You can use a set of cmdlets that begin with `Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway*`.

Be sure to update your on-premises configuration and delete any existing rules for the old IP address ranges after you update your Azure network environment.

For more information, see these articles:
- [Create a site-to-site connection](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) with VPN Gateway.
- [Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/get-azurermvirtualnetworkgateway?view=azurermps-6.5.0) PowerShell cmdlets
- The [Create a site-to-site connection](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ralfwi/2017/02/02/connecting-clouds/) blog post describes how to create a site-to-site connection between Azure Germany and global Azure.
 
## Application Gateway

Migrating an Azure Application Gateway instance from Azure Germany to global Azure isn't supported at this time. We recommend that you create and configure a new instance of Application Gateway in global Azure.

Collect information about your current gateway configuration by using the Azure portal or PowerShell. You can use a set of cmdlets that begin with `Get-AzureRmApplicationGateway*`.

For more information, see these articles:
- [Create an application gateway](../application-gateway/quick-create-portal.md)
- [Get-AzureRmApplicationGateway](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/get-azurermapplicationgateway?view=azurermps-6.5.0) PowerShell cmdlets.
