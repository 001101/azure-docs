# AI + Machine Learning

## Machine Learning

It's not possible to migrate the content of an Azure Machine Learning workspace and web service from Azure Germany to global Azure. You must recreate them by hand. The steps are:

- Open an experiment from a workspace in Azure Germany in one browser screen.
- In another browser screen, create a new workspace in a global Azure region (West Europe for example).
- Create a blank new experiment in the new workspace.
- Follow the graph displayed in the Azure Germany workspace. Replicate it manually by dragging and dropping the modules in the new workspace. Connect them with lines.
- Press *Run* button to execute the new experiment.
- If you deploy a web service, press *Create predictive experiment* to create a predictive experiment from the training experiment.
- Press *Run* again in the auto-generated predictive experiment.
- Press *Deploy* button to deploy a new web service.
