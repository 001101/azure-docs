# Onboarding Peering Service

Peering Service is a networking service that improves internet access to Microsoft Public services such as Office 35, Dynamics 365, SaaS services running on Azure or any Microsoft services accessible via public IP Azure. 

As it works on the partnership program with certified Service Providers, you can on-board the service by reaching out to them with no requirements from Microsoft. Further, the customer is not required to do any registration process with Microsoft.

To onboard the service, do the following:

- Work with Internet Service provider or Internet Exchange Partner to obtain Peering Service to connect your network with Microsoft network.
- Ensure the connectivity providers are certified to provide Peering Service.

Action plans are described as below:

| **Step** | **Action**| **What you get**| **Costs**|
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
|1|Customer to provision the connectivity from a certified partner (no interaction with Microsoft) ​ |An Internet provider who is well connected to Microsoft and meets the technical requirements for performant and reliable connectivity to Microsoft. ​ |Connectivity costs from the Service Provider offering​. No additional data transfer costs from Microsoft​ |
