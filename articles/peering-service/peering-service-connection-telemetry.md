# Peering Service connection telemetry

Connection telemetry is the insights collected for a specific connection. Customers can opt to obtain monitoring reports by defining the connection telemetry metrics. 

## Preview Scope

Telemetry scope is comprised of the following:  

**Latency Measurement**

Measures the latency from the client to the Microsoft Edge and based on which visual reports are generated. 

Preferences are provided for those prefixes registered with Peering Service. 

**Prefix Monitoring** 

Monitors routing path for any suspicious activity and captures the same in the event logs. For instance, event logs are created for some of the factors specified below: 

   - Origin autonomous exchange 

   - BJP Withdrawal 

   - Route leak 

## Benefits 

 - Identify the root cause analysis. 

 - Avert the risk of service outages. 

 - Control over the routing traffic. 

##	Preview Limitations
**Latency telemetry** 

- At the granular level, latency reports are generated for every 1 hour.  

- Reports can be viewed in the Azure dashboard and not sent as notifications. 

## Next steps
