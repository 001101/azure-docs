# Set up the rules engine for Standard Azure CDN

> [!NOTE]
> The rules engine is available only for Standard Azure Content Delivery Network from Microsoft. 

You can use the Standard rules engine for Azure Content Delivery Network (Azure CDN) to customize how HTTP requests are handled. For example, you can use the rules engine to enforce content delivery to use specific protocols, to define a caching policy, or to modify an HTTP header. This article demonstrates how to create a rule that automatically redirects users to HTTPS. 

## Redirect users to HTTPS

1. In your Microsoft profiles, go to Azure Content Delivery Network.

1. On the **CDN profile** page, select the endpoint you want to create rules for.
  
1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
   
    The **Rules Engine** pane appears and displays the list of available global rules.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The order in which multiple rules are listed affects how rules are handled. A subsequent rule might override the actions that are specified in an existing rule.
   >

1. Select **Add rule** and enter a rule name. Rule names must start with a letter and can contain only numbers and letters.

1. Identify the type of requests the rule applies to:
    1. Select **Add condition**, and then select the **Request protocol** match condition.
    1. For **Operator**, select **Equals**.
    1. For **Value**, select **HTTP**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can select from multiple match conditions in the **Add condition** drop-down list. For a detailed list of match conditions, see [Rules engine match conditions](cdn-standard-rules-engine-match-conditions.md).
   
1. Select the action to apply to the identified requests:
   1. Select **Add action**, and then select **URL redirect**.
   1. For **Type**, select **Found (302)**.
   1. For **Protocol**, select **HTTPS**.
   1. Leave all other fields blank to use incoming values.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can select from multiple actions in the **Add action** drop-down list. For a detailed list of actions, see [Rules engine actions](cdn-standard-rules-engine-actions.md).

6. Select **Save** to save the new rule. The rule is now available to use.
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Rule changes can take up to 15 minutes to propagate through Azure CDN.
