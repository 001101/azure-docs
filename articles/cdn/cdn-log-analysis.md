# Analyze Azure CDN usage patterns

After enabling CDN for your application, you may want to monitor the CDN usage, check the health of your delivery, and troubleshoot potential issues. Azure CDN provides these capabilities with the following two products: 

## CDN Core Analytics

As a current Azure CDN user with Verizon standard or premium profile, you can view core analytics in the supplemental portal accessible via the **Manage** option from the Azure portal. For more information, see [CDN Core Analytics](cdn-analyze-usage-patterns.md)

## Azure Diagnostic Logs

This feature is available for all CDN endpoints belonging to Verizon (Standard & Premium) and Akamai (Standard) CDN Profiles. For more information, see [Diagnostic Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-of-diagnostic-logs).
