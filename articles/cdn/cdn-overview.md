# What is Azure Content Delivery Network?

A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers that are close to end users, to minimize latency. The benefits of using a CDN to cache web site assets include:

* Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are required to load content.
* Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.
* Distribution of user requests and serving of content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server.

Azure Content Delivery Network offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. To see a list of current CDN node locations, see [Azure CDN POP locations](cdn-pop-locations.md).

To use Azure CDN, you must create at least one CDN profile. A CDN profile is a collection of CDN endpoints; each profile can contain one or more CDN endpoints. Every CDN endpoint in your profile represents a specific configuration of content deliver behavior and access. To organize your CDN endpoints by internet domain, web application, or some other criteria, you can use multiple profiles. Because [Azure CDN pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cdn/) is applied at the CDN profile level, you must create multiple CDN profiles if you want to use a mix of pricing tiers.

To use Azure CDN, you must own at lease one Azure subscription. Each Azure subscription has default limits for the following resources:
 - The number of CDN profiles that can be created
 - The number of endpoints that can be created in a CDN profile 
 - The number of custom domains that can be mapped to an endpoint

For more information about CDN subscription limits, see [CDN limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#cdn-limits).


## How it works
![CDN Overview](./media/cdn-overview/cdn-overview.png)

1. A user (Alice) requests a file (also called an asset) by using a URL with a special domain name, such as `<endpointname>.azureedge.net`. 
    
2. The DNS routes the request to the best performing point-of-presence (POP) location, which is usually the POP that is geographically closest to the user.
    
3. If the edge servers in the POP do not have the file in their cache, the edge server requests the file from the origin server. 

    The origin server can be an Azure Web App, Azure Cloud Service, Azure Storage account, or any publicly accessible web server.
   
4. The origin returns the file to the edge server.
    
5. The edge server caches the file and returns the file to the original requestor (Alice). 
 
    The file remains cached on the edge server until the time-to-live (TTL) specified by its HTTP headers expires. If the origin didn't specify a TTL, the default TTL is seven days.
    
6. Additional users can then request the same file by using the same URL that Alice used, and can also be directed to the same POP.
    
7. If the TTL for the file hasn't expired, the edge server returns the file directly from the cache. This process results in a faster, more responsive user experience.
