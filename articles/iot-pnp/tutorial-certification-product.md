# Tutorial: Add your product information

In the tutorial, you learned about how to register your company to the portal, create Plug and Play models and implement your device code to be certified.

This tutorial shows you how to add the product information that's shown in the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](https://aka.ms/iotdevcat) for your Plug and Play device.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Certification requirements

To certify your IoT Plug and Play device, your device must meet following requirements:

* Your IoT Plug and Play device code must be installed on your device.
* Your device code must support the [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md).
* Your device code must implement [Device Information Interface](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-IoT-PnP-Preview/blob/master/src/provisioningscripts/samples/interfaces/DeviceInformation.interface.json)

Use the [IoT Plug and Play SDK](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-IoT-PnP-Preview) for writing your device code. The SDK makes it easy to add Plug and Play support to your device
