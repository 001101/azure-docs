# IoT Plug and Play Preview limits, quotas, and throttles

This article explains the IoT Plug and Play-specific limits, quotas, and throttling that apply in the public preview. There are existing [IoT Hub quotas and throttling](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling.md) that also apply.

## IoT Hub

For the public preview, the following limits and quotas apply to an IoT hub:

| Limits, restrictions, and throttles | Value | Notes |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Number of interfaces that can be registered per hub | 1500 ||
| Maximum number of components that can be registered per model | 299 ||
| Maximum size of an interface file | 512 KB ||
| Maximum size of a component name | 64 chars ||
| Maximum size of a property name  | 64 bytes, 7 levels in depth (and the first level is reserved for `$iotin`) | Allowed characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9 (not as the first character), and underscore. |
| Maximum size of a property value | Same as [IoT Hub Limits](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md#device-twin-size)||
| Maximum size of a command name | 64 chars ||
| Device twin size | Same as [IoT Hub Limits](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md#device-twin-size) ||
| Resolution API calls across SKU (regardless of units) | 100 requests/second ||

## Model Repository

The following limits and quotas apply to a model repository:

| Limits, restrictions, and throttles | Value |
|-----|-----|
| Number of unpublished interfaces per Azure Active Directory tenant| 1500  |
| Number of published interfaces per Azure Active Directory tenant| 1500  |
| Number of model repositories being created/updated by a tenant| 1 QPS |
| Number of interfaces being published | 10 QPS|
| Number of interfaces being created | 10 QPS|

## Parser library

The parser library follows the limits that apply to the [Digital Twin Definition Language](https://github.com/Azure/IoTPlugandPlay/tree/master/DTDL).

## Next steps

A suggested next step is to learn how to [Connect to and interact with an IoT Plug and Play device](./howto-connect-pnp-device-solution.md).
