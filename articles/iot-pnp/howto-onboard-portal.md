# Onboard to the Azure Certified for IoT portal

You can use the Azure Certified for IoT portal to:

- Complete the certification process for your IoT device.
- Find IoT Plug and Play device capability models. You can use these models to quickly build IoT ready devices and integrate them with solutions.

## Sign in

The type of account you use to sign in to the portal determines the features you have access to:

If you sign in with a Microsoft _work account_, you can:

- Run certification tests.
- Browse the device capability model repositories.

If you sign in with a [Microsoft Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/) account, you can:

- Run certification tests.
- Browse the device capability model repositories.
- Publish your device in the IoT Certified Device Catalog.

The Azure Certified for IoT portal checks your membership with the Partner Center when you sign in:

- If your organization is already a member of the Partner Center, you're granted access to all functions in the portal.
- If you see a notification message that your Microsoft Partner Network ID is missing, you should [create a Partner Center account](https://docs.microsoft.com/artner-center/mpn-create-a-partner-center-account). When your account is approved, you can return to the portal and publish your device. For more information, see the [Partner Center FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4340639/partner-center-account-faqs).

Before you publish your device to the IoT Certified Device Catalog, read and accept the program agreement. You can find the agreement on the settings page in the Azure Certified for IoT portal.

## Next steps

The suggested next step is to learn how to [submit a Plug and Play device for certification](tutorial-certification-test.md).
