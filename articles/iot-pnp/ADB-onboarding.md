If you have a work account, you can benefit from most functionalities of Azure Certified for IoT portal, including running certification tests and browsing device capability model repositories. However, certain experiences such as publication of your device to the IoT Certified Device Catalog will require a Microsoft Partner Center account. Microsoft Partner Center is your one-stop location for managing your end-to-end relationship with Microsoft. It has tools and resources to help you transact and grow your business, including membership options, customer referrals, and the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program. When you join a Microsoft partner program, you become part of a global community that connects you to the relationships, insights, tools, resources, and programs you need to amaze your customers and drive business growth.

We automatically check your membership with the Partner Center when you sign in to the Azure Certified for IoT portal. If your organization is already a member of the Partner Center, you are granted access to full functionality of the website. However, if you see a notification message that your Microsoft Partner Network ID is missing, you should [create a Partner Center account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/mpn-create-a-partner-center-account). Once your account is created and approved, you can return to the Certified for IoT portal to complete the device publication process. For questions, please refer to [Partner Center FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4340639/partner-center-account-faqs).

It is also important read and accept the program agreement located in the settings page in order to publish your device to the IoT Certified Device Catalog.
