# Understand the IoT Plug and Play Preview model repository

This article describes concepts behind the IoT Plug and Play Preview model repository.

## IoT Plug and Play Preview model repository

The model repository stores the Digital Twin interfaces that describe the functionality of IoT Plug and Play devices. Device manufacturers store the interfaces associated with their devices in the model repository. The model repository provides role-based access control (RBAC) both on the tenant and on the interfaces themselvs, so that device developers and tenant administrators can determine whether interfaces should be public or private, as well as who can read, modify. and publish them. Users can view all public interfaces in the model repository as well as those private interfaces that they have been granted access to. IoT solutions can query the model repository for interfaces specified in  device telemetry messages sent by devices when they connect to an IoT hub.

You can use the [Azure Certified for IoT portal](https://aka.ms/ACFI), Azure CLI commands, SDK APIs, and REST APIs to interact with the model repository.

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Tenant roles and permissions

The following table describes the roles that can be assigned on the tenant.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Creator | CreateModel </br> ReadTenantModels |
| Publisher | PublishModel </br> ReadTenantModels |
| Tenant Administrator | CreateModel </br> ManageAccess </br> ReadTenantInformation </br> ReadTenantModels |

The following table describes the permissions that can be granted in the tenant with the different roles.

| Permission | Description |
|------------| ------------|
| CreateModel | Allows the user to create  models in the tenant. |
| ManageAccess | Allows the user to assign or remove other users to the *Administrator*, *Creator*, or *Publisher* roles in the tenant. |
| PublishModel | Allows the user to publish models that exist in the tenant. |
| ReadTenantInformation | Allows the user to read information about the tenant; for example, number of interfaces. |
| ReadTenantModels | Allows the user to view all models in the tenant. |

The first user in an organization's tenant to log on to the [Azure Certified for IoT portal](https://aka.ms/ACFI) is assigned the *Tenant Administrator* role. That person can then add other users in the tenant to tenant roles.

### Model roles and permissions

Once an interface is published, it's available publicly (anonymous authentication). Device manufacturers may, however, want to maintain private interfaces; for example, they may have customers who require that their device capabilities remain confidential. For this scenario, the model repository exposes permissions and roles that can be applied to individual  models.

The following table describes the roles that can be granted on an individual model.

| Role | Permissions | Remarks |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Model Administrator (owner) | ReadModel </br> ModelAdministrator | The *Model Administrator* role is automatically assigned to the user who creates the model. The user must be in either the *Tenant Administrator* or the *Creator* role on the tenant. |
| Reader | ReadModel | The *Reader* role can only be assigned to service identities and external users. To read a model, users in the tenant must be either the owner of the model or be in one of the tenant roles that grants the *ReadTenantModels* permission. |

The following table describes the permissions that are granted on a model with the different roles.

| Permission | Description |
|------------| ------------|
| Model Administrator | Allows the user to add or remove access to the model on which it is granted by assigning the *Reader* role to an external user or service identity. </br></br> Allows the user to read sharing info about the model on which it is granted. For example, the number of times a model has been shared and who the model has been shared with. |
| ReadModel | Allows the assigned user or service identity to view only the model on which it is granted. |

When a user in the *Tenant Creator* role adds a new model to the model repository, that user is automatically assigned the *Model Administrator* role on the model. The model administrator can add external users and service identities to the *Reader* role on the model. Typically a device manufacturer will generate a service identity (service principal) at the request of an external partner and add that service principal to the *Reader* role on the models that the partner needs access to.
