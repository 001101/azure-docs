# Develop an IoT Plug and Play Preview end-to-end solution

IoT Plug and Play Preview simplifies IoT by enabling you to interact with a device's capabilities without knowledge of the underlying device implementation. This tutorial shows you how to use a sample IoT Plug and Play Preview device written in C and interact with it using the Node.js service SDK.

## Prerequisites

**Installation for Bug Bash 5/13**

1. Create an IoT Hub in Central US region, with the **IOTPNP_TEST_BY_MAIN** subscription. Create the IoT Hub under this subscription, within the resource group **BugBash** in the supported region: **Central US**.

1. Download and install the latest release of **Azure IoT explorer** from the tool's [repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases) page, by selecting the .msi file under "Assets" for the most recent update.

1. Complete the sections in the [C device quickstart](./quickstart-connect-device-c.md) to download and build the code in the Azure IoT Hub Device C SDK.

1. Complete the section in the [Node.js service quickstart](quickstart-service-node.md) to install the required dependencies.

## The device and the models

The sample device declares its model definition in the `azure-iot-sdk-c\digitaltwin_client\samples\SampleDevice.model.json` file:

```json
{
  "@id": "dtmi:com:example:SampleDevice;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "displayName": "My Sample Model",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": "Component",
      "schema": "dtmi:com:example:EnvironmentalSensor;1",
      "name": "sensor"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Component",
      "schema": "dtmi:azure:DeviceManagement:DeviceInformation;1",
      "name": "deviceInformation"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Component",
      "schema": "dtmi:azure:Client:SDKInformation;1",
      "name": "sdkInformation"
    }
  ],
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2"
}
```

This model shows that the sample device implements three IoT Plug and Play interfaces:

1. EnvironmentalSensor: `"schema": "dtmi:com:example:EnvironmentalSensor;1"`
1. DeviceInformation: `"schema": "dtmi:azure:DeviceManagement:DeviceInformation;1"`
1. SDKInformation: `"schema": "dtmi:azure:Client:SDKInformation;1"`

The last two, are public interfaces and are published in the global repository:

- [DeviceInfo](https://devicemodels.azureiotsolutions.com/models/public/dtmi:azure:DeviceManagement:DeviceInformation;1?codeView=true)
- See definition for [SDKInfo](https://devicemodels.azureiotsolutions.com/models/public/dtmi:azure:Client:SDKInformation;1?codeView=true)

The EnvironmentalSensor interface, is [defined in the C solution sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/public-preview-pnp/digitaltwin_client/samples/digitaltwin_sample_environmental_sensor/EnvironmentalSensor.interface.json) as follows:

```json
{
  "@id": "dtmi:com:example:EnvironmentalSensor;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "displayName": "Environmental Sensor",
  "description": "Provides functionality to report temperature, humidity. Provides telemetry, commands and read-write properties",
  "comment": "Requires temperature and humidity sensors.",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "displayName": "Device State",
      "description": "The state of the device. Two states are available or not available.",
      "name": "state",
      "schema": "boolean"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "displayName": "Customer Name",
      "description": "The name of the customer currently operating the device.",
      "name": "name",
      "schema": "string",
      "writable": true
    },
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "displayName": "Brightness Level",
      "description": "The brightness level for the light on the device. Can be specified as 1 (high), 2 (medium), 3 (low)",
      "name": "brightness",
      "writable": true,
      "schema": "integer"
    },
    {
      "@type": [
        "Telemetry",
        "Temperature"
      ],
      "description": "Current temperature on the device",
      "displayName": "Temperature",
      "name": "temp",
      "schema": "double",
      "unit": "degreeCelsius"
    },
    {
      "@type": [
        "Telemetry",
        "RelativeHumidity"
      ],
      "description": "Current humidity on the device",
      "displayName": "Humidity",
      "name": "humidity",
      "schema": "double",
      "unit": "percent"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Command",
      "description": "This Command will begin blinking the LED for given time interval.",
      "name": "blink",
      "request": {
        "name": "interval",
        "schema": "integer"
      },
      "response": {
        "name": "blinkResponse",
        "schema": {
          "@type": "Object",
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "description",
              "schema": "string"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Command",
      "name": "turnOn",
      "comment": "This Command will turn on the LED light on the device."
    },
    {
      "@type": "Command",
      "name": "turnOff",
      "comment": "This Command will turn off the LED light on the device."
    }
  ],
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2"
}
```

## Implement the device in C

To view the sample device code, navigate to the `azure-iot-sdk-c\digitaltwin_client\samples` folder. The files in this folder show how the interfaces are implemented and how to create a client application. To learn more about these files, see the [Connect a sample IoT Plug and Play Preview device application (C)](quickstart-connect-device-c.md) quickstart.

Use the following command to run the sample device:

``` cmd/sh
azure-iot-sdk-c\cmake\digitaltwin_client\samples\digitaltwin_sample_device\Debug\digitaltwin_sample_device.exe <YourDeviceConnectionString>
```

Leave the sample code running and use Azure IoT Explorer to verify that it connected to your IoT hub. In Azure IoT Explorer:

1. Open the IoT hub you created for this tutorial.
1. In the device list, select the device you created for this tutorial.
1. Navigate to the **IoT Plug and Play components** tab.

    > [!TIP]
    > Azure IoT Explorer can't display the private component and its properties, commands, and telemetry definitions. Copy the `SampleDevice.model.json` model file and the `EnvironmentalSensor.interface.json` interface file to a folder on your local machine. Then configure the Azure IoT Explorer tool to point to this folder.

1. Send commands such as **turnOn**, **turnOff**, and **blink**. The sample device shows messages similar to the following output:

    ```cmd/bash
    Info: DigitalTwin Client Core: Processing method callback for method $iotin:sensor*turnOff, payload=000001E15861FDE0, size=84
    Info: DigitalTwin Interface : Invoking callback to process command turnOff on interface name sensor
    Info: ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSOR_INTERFACE: Turn off light command invoked
    Info: ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSOR_INTERFACE: Turn off light data=<null>
    Info: DigitalTwin Interface: Callback to process command returned.  responseData=0000000000000000, responseLen=0, responseStatus=200
    Info: DigitalTwin Client Core: Processing telemetry callback.  confirmationResult=IOTHUB_CLIENT_CONFIRMATION_OK, userContextCallback=000001E1585FF0C0
    Info: DigitalTwin Interface: Invoking telemetry confirmation callback for component name=sensor, reportedStatus=DIGITALTWIN_CLIENT_OK, userContextCallback=0000000000000000
    ```

## Interact with sample device from code

To use the Node Service SDK to interact with sample device, navigate to the service node sample code in the `azure-iot-sdk-node\digitaltwins\samples\service\javascript` folder:

1. Run the `get_digital_twin.js` script to find the device model ID:

    ```cmd/bash
    getting digital twin for device EM_Device01...
    device metadata:
    {
      "$model": "dtmi:com:example:SampleDevice;1"
    }
    ```

1. Run the `invoke_component_command.js` to call the `turnOn` command:

    ```cmd/bash
    azure-iot-sdk-node\digitaltwins\samples\service\javascript>node invoke_component_command.js
    invoking command turnOn on component instancesensor for device EM_Device01...
    null
    ```

    The sample device shows output similar to the output shown when you used the Azure IoT Explorer.
