# Build an IoT solution for IoT Plug and Play devices

This article describes how, as a solution developer, you can build an IoT solution for IoT Plug and Play devices.

There are two broad categories of IoT solution: purpose-built solutions that work with a known set of IoT Plug and Play devices, and model-driven solutions that work with any IoT Plug and Play device.

This how-to article shows you how to build both types of solution. The article also provides sample applications to get you started.

## Prerequisites

Before you start:

- Either, acquire an IoT Plug and Play device that's pre-configured to connect to your device provisioning service instance or IoT Hub. You can find these devices in the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/).
- Or, use a simulated version of a sample device. You can use the [Node SDK device sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/tree/master/device/samples).

To complete the tutorial, you need Node.js version 10.0.x or later. Node.js is available for [download](https://nodejs.org) for multiple platforms.

You can verify the current version of node.js on your development machine by using the following command:

```cmd/sh
node --version
```

## Capability discovery

When an IoT Plug and Play device first connects to your IoT hub, it sends a model information telemetry message. This message includes the IDs of the interfaces the device implements. For your solution to work with the device, it must resolve those IDs and retrieve the definitions for each interface.

Here are the steps an IoT Plug and Play device takes when it uses the Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to connect to a hub:

1. When the device is turned on, it connects to the global end point for the DPS and authenticates using one of the allowed methods.
1. DPS then authenticates the device and looks up the rule that tells it which IoT hub to assign the device to. DPS then registers the device with that hub.
1. DPS returns an IoT Hub connection string to the device.
1. The device then sends a discovery telemetry message to your IoT Hub. The discovery telemetry message contains the IDs of the interfaces the device implements.
1. The IoT Plug and Play device is now ready to work with a solution that uses your IoT hub.

If the device connects directly to your IoT hub, it connects using a connection string that's embedded in the device code. The device then sends a discovery telemetry message to your IoT Hub.

See the [ModelInformation](concepts-common-interfaces.md) interface to learn more about the model information telemetry message.

### Purpose-built IoT solutions

A purpose-built IoT solution works with a known set of IoT Plug and Play device capability models and interfaces.

You'll have the capability model and interfaces for the devices that will connect to your solution ahead of time. Use the following steps to prepare your solution:

1. Store the interface JSON files in Azure in a location where your solution can read them.
1. Write logic in your IoT solution based on the expected IoT Plug and Play capability models and interface. For more information, see this [sample IoT application](overview-iot-plug-and-play.md).
1. Then, subscribe to notifications from the IoT hub your solution uses.

When you receive a notification for a new device connection, follow these steps:

1. Read the discovery telemetry message to retrieve the IDs of the capability model and interfaces implemented by the device.
1. Compare the ID of the capability model against the IDs of the capability models you stored ahead of time.
1. Now you know what type of device has connected. Use the logic you wrote earlier to enable users to interact with the device appropriately.

### Model-driven solutions

A model-driven IoT solution can work with any IoT Plug and Play device. Building a model driven IoT Solution is more complex, but the benefit is that your solution works with any devices added in the future.

To build a model-driven IoT solution, you need to build logic against the IoT Plug and Play interface primitives: telemetry, properties, and commands. Your IoT solution's logic represent a device by combining multiple telemetry, property, and command capabilities.

Your solution must also subscribe to notifications from the IoT hub it uses.

When your solution receives a notification for a new device connection, follow these steps:

1. Read the discovery telemetry message to retrieve the IDs of the capability model and interfaces implemented by the device.
1. For each ID, read the full JSON file to find the device's capabilities.
1. Check to see if each interface is present in any caches you've built for storing the JSON files retrieved earlier by your solution.
1. Then, check if an interface with that ID is present in the global model repository. For more information, see [Global model repository](overview-iot-plug-and-play.md).

    ```c
    Code sample
    ```

1. If the interface isn't present in the global model repository, try looking for it in any private model repositories known to your solution. You need a connection string to access a private model repository. For more information, see [Private model repository](overview-iot-plug-and-play.md).

    ```c
    Code sample
    ```

1. If you can't find all the interfaces in either the global model repository, or in a private model repository, you can check if the device can provide the interface definition. A device can implement the standard [ModelDefinition](overview-iot-plug-and-play.md) interface to publish information about how to retrieve interface files with a command.

    ```c
    Code sample
    ```

1. If you found JSON files for each interface implemented by the device, you can enumerate the capabilities of the device. Use the logic you wrote earlier to enable users to interact with the device.
1. At any time, you can call the digital twins API to retrieve the capability model ID and interface IDs for the device.

    ```c
    Code sample
    ```

## Next steps

Now that you've built an IoT solution for IoT Plug and Play devices, learn more about the [Azure IoT Platform](overview-iot-plug-and-play.md) to leverage other capabilities for your solution.
