# Manage models in the model repository

The Azure IoT Model Repository stores the models defined using [DTDLv2](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) language specification. The model repository makes the models discoverable and consumable by device and solution developers.

You can use the [Azure IoT Model Repository portal](https://aka.ms/iotmodelrepo), the [Azure CLI model repository commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot/pnp?view=azure-cli-latest), or the [Model repository REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/iothub/digitaltwinmodelrepositoryservice/getmodel/getmodel) to manage models in the repository.  

## Public and Private models

Models can be privately visible to the company (or organization) or publicly available to everyone.

Company models are private and are maintained by your company (or organization). Access to company models is controlled through role-based access control (RBAC) on your repository tenant. Repository tenant roles determine who can create and publish models in your organization. Permissions on models allow the creator of a model, which is private to the company (or organization), to share it with a limited audience external to your organization.

Once a model has been published, it is public. Public models are available anonymously.

For an overview of model repository concepts including RBAC, see [Understand the Azure IoT Model Repository](concepts-model-repository.md).

## Set up your model repository tenant and users

Use your _work or school account_ to access the model repository. To learn how to set up an Azure AD tenant and how to create a user or service principal in an Azure AD tenant, see the [Additional information](#additional-information) section.

- If you're the first user from your organization to access the model repository or to sign in to the portal, you're granted the _Tenant Administrator_ role. This role allows you to assign roles to other users in your organization's repository (repository tenant).
- You can be assigned other roles by a _Tenant Administrator_ like _ReadTenantModels_ or _CreateModels_.
- To publish your models, your organization needs to be a member of the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/). To create a partner center account, see [create a Partner Center account](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/mpn-create-a-partner-center-account). After your account is approved, you can publish your models. For more information, see the [Partner Center FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4340639/partner-center-account-faqs).

## Manage model repository tenant roles

 By default, users and service principals can read their company's private models, models that have been shared with them by other companies, and all public models. Repository tenant administrators can add users and service principals  to repository tenant roles so that they can create private models, publish private models, or manage roles for other users and service principals.

To add permissions to a user or a service principal in a model repository tenant role using the portal:

1. Sign-in to the [Azure IoT Model Repository portal](https://aka.ms/iotmodelrepo).

2. Select **Access management** on the left pane, then select **+Add**. On the **Add Permission** pane, type the work address of the user you want to add to the role.

3. Choose the role you want to add the user to from the **Role** dropdown. Then select **Save**.

    ![Choose tenant role.](./media/howto-manage-models/choose-role.png)

## Upload a model

You must be a member of the repository tenant's _Creator_ role to upload a model to the model repository.

To upload a model using the portal:

1. Sign-in to the [Azure IoT Model Repository portal](https://aka.ms/iotmodelrepo).

2. Expand **Company Models** on the left pane and select **Create model**. Then select **Import Json**.

    ![Create a model.](./media/howto-manage-models/create-model.png)

3. Select the file you want to upload. If the portal successfully validates your model, select **Save**.

## Share a private model

You can share private models that you have created with users and service principals of external organizations. In this way, you can allow your collaborators to view and develop solutions with your company's private models.

To share a private model using the portal:

If you're the creator of a model, the **Share** and **Shared with** buttons will be active when you view the model in your Company models section.

![Model sharing.](./media/howto-manage-models/share-model.png)

- To share the model with an external user, select **Share**. In the **Share model** pane, enter the email address of the external user and select **Save**.

- To see the users who you have shared the model with, select **Shared with**.

- To stop sharing the model with a specific user, select the user from the list of users on the **Shared with** pane. Then select **Remove** and confirm your choice when prompted.

    ![Stop sharing a model.](./media/howto-manage-models/unshare-model.png)

## Publish a model

To publish a model, the following requirements must be met:

1. The company (or organization) tenant must be a Microsoft Partner. To learn how to register as a Microsoft Partner, see [Set up your model repository tenant and users](#set-up-your-model-repository-tenant-and-users).

2. The user or service principal must be a member of the repository tenant's _Publisher_ role.

To publish a model using the portal:

1. Sign-in to the [Azure IoT Model Repository portal](https://aka.ms/iotmodelrepo).

2. Expand **Company Models** on the left pane and select the model you want to publish. Then select **Publish**.

    ![Publish a model.](./media/howto-manage-models/publish-model.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you get a notification saying that that you don't have a Microsoft Partner (MPN) ID, follow the registration steps in the notification. For more information, see [Set up your model repository tenant and users](#set-up-your-model-repository-tenant-and-users).

## Manage models with the Model repository REST API

To manage models with the Model repository REST API, see the [Model repository REST API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/iothub/digitaltwinmodelrepositoryservice/getmodel/getmodel). When calling the REST APIs to manage private models of a company (or organization), you need to provide an  Authorization token in JWT format for the user or service principal. See the [Additional information](#additional-information) section to learn how to get the JWT token for a user or service principal.

## Manage models with the Azure CLI

To manage models with the Azure CLI, see the documentation for the [az iot pnp command](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot/pnp?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Additional information

You may find the following topics helpful when working with Azure Active Directory:

- To create a new Azure AD tenant, see [Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant). Note that most organizations will already have Azure AD tenants.

- To add users or guest users to an Azure AD tenant, see [Add or delete users using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory).

- To add a service principal to an Azure AD tenant, see [How to use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

- To learn how to get a JWT token from Azure AD to use when calling REST APIs, see [Acquire a token from Azure AD for authorizing requests from a client application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-app).
