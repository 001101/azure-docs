# Tutorial: Create an Azure Service Fabric Mesh app

You will learn how to create an Azure Service Fabric app consisting of an ASP.NET web front-end and an ASP.NET Core Web API back-end service. Then you will debug the app on your local development cluster, after which you will publish the app to Azure. When you're finished, you'll have a simple to-do app that demonstrates how to make a service-to-service call in a Service Fabric app.

In this tutorial you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a Service Fabric Mesh app consisting of a ASP.NET web front-end.
> * Add a back-end service to the project & retrieve data from it.
> * Debug the app locally.
> * Publish the app to Azure.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/include-preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you've [set up your development environment](service-fabric-mesh-setup-developer-environment-sdk.md) which includes installing the Service Fabric runtime, SDK, Docker, and Visual Studio 2017.

## Create a Service Fabric Mesh project

Run Visual Studio and select **File** > **New** > **Project...**

In the **New Project** dialog, type **mesh** into the **Search** box at the top. Select the **Service Fabric Mesh Application** template.

In the **Name** box, type **ServiceFabricApp** and in the **Location** box, set the folder path to where the files for the project will be stored.

Make sure that **Create directory for solution** is checked, and click **OK** to create the Service Fabric Mesh project. Next you will see the **New Service Fabric Service** dialog.

![Visual studio new Service Fabric Mesh project dialog](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-new-project.png)

### Create the web front-end service

In the **New Service Fabric Service** dialog, select the **ASP.NET Core** project type, make sure **Container OS** is set to **Windows**.

Set the **Service Name** to something unique because the name of the service is used as the repository name of the Docker image. This tutorial will use the name **WebFrontEnd**. If you have an existing Docker image with the same repository name, it will be overwritten by Visual Studio. Open a terminal and use the Docker command `docker images` to verify that the project name you have chosen isn't being used as a docker repository name. If it is, choose another service name unless you have no concerns about overwriting the existing docker image.

Press **OK** to create the ASP.NET Core service. Next you will see the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application** dialog.

![Visual studio new Service Fabric Mesh project dialog](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-new-service-fabric-service.png)

In the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application** dialog, select **Web Application** and then click **OK**.

![Visual studio new ASP.NET core application](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-new-aspnetcore-app.png)

Now we have the Service Fabric Application project which includes the ASP.NET Core project that we will use to display to-do information. Now we will create the model that will represent to-do information.

## Create the to-do items model

For simplicity, we will store the to-do items in a list in memory. We need to define a class to represent the to-do items, and a list to hold them. We'll create a class library for this.

In Visual Studio, which currently has the Service Fabric Mesh app loaded, select **File** > **Add** > **New Project**.

In the **New Project** dialog, type **C# .net core class** into the **Search** box at the top. Select the **Class Library (.NET Core)** template.

In the **Name** box, type **Model** and in the **Location** box, set the folder path to where the files for the project will be stored. Click **OK** to create the class library.

In the Solution explorer, under **Model**, right-click **Class1.cs** and choose **Rename**. Rename the class **ToDoItem.cs**. A prompt may appear asking whether to rename all references to `Class1`. Click **Yes**.

Replace the contents of the empty `class ToDoItem` with the following:

```csharp
public class ToDoItem
{
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public int Index { get; set; }
    public bool Completed { get; set; }

    public ToDoItem(string description)
    {
        Description = description;
        Index = 0;
    }

    public static ToDoItem Load(string description, int index, bool completed)
    {
        ToDoItem newItem = new ToDoItem(description)
        {
            Index = index,
            Completed = completed
        };

        return newItem;
    }
}
```

This class represents individual to-do items.

We need a list to hold the to-do items. In Visual Studio, right-click the **Model** class library, and select **Add** > **Class...** The **Add New Item** dialog will appear. Set the **Name** to **ToDoList.cs** and click **Add**.

In **ToDoList.cs**, replace the empty `class ToDoList` with the following code:

```csharp
public class ToDoList
{
    private List<ToDoItem> _items;

    public string Name { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<ToDoItem> Items { get => _items; }

    public ToDoList(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
        _items = new List<ToDoItem>();
    }

    public ToDoItem Add(string description)
    {
        var item = new ToDoItem(description);
        _items.Add(item);
        item.Index = _items.IndexOf(item);
        return item;
    }
    public void Add(ToDoItem item)
    {
        _items.Add(item);
        item.Index = _items.Count - 1;
    }

    public ToDoItem RemoveAt(int index)
    {
        if (index >= 0 && index < _items.Count)
        {
            var result = _items[index];
            _items.RemoveAt(index);

            // Reorder items
            for (int i = index; i < _items.Count; i++)
            {
                _items[i].Index = i;
            }

            return result;
        }
        else
        {
            throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();
        }
    }
}
```

Next, create the service fabric service (a Web API project) that will track the to-do items.

## Create the back-end service

In the Visual Studio **Solution Explorer** window, right-click **ServiceFabricMeshApp** and click **Add** > **New Service Fabric Service...**

The **New Service Fabric Service** dialog appears. Select the **ASP.NET Core** project type, and make sure **Container OS** is set to **Windows**.

Set the **Service Name** to something unique because the name of the service is used as the repository name of the Docker image. This tutorial will use the name **ToDoService**. If you have an existing Docker image with the same repository name, it will be overwritten by Visual Studio. Open a terminal and use the Docker command `docker images` to verify that the project name you have chosen isn't being used as a docker repository name. If it is, choose another service name unless you are not concerned about about overwriting the existing docker image.

Click **OK** to create the ASP.NET Core service. Next, the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application** dialog will appear. In that dialog select **API** and then **OK**, and a project for the service is added to the solution. 

![Visual studio new ASP.NET core application](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-new-aspnetcore-app.png)

Because this is a back-end service that doesn't provide any UI, turn off launching the browser when the service is launched. In the **Solution Explorer**, right-click **ToDoService**, and select **Properties**. In the properties window that appears, select the **Debug** tab on the left, and uncheck **Launch browser**.

Because this service maintains the to-do information, we need to add a reference to the Model class library. In the Solution Explorer, right-click **ToDoService** and then select **Add** > **Reference...**. The **Reference Manager** dialog will appear.

In the **Reference Manager**, select the checkbox for **Model**, and click **OK**.

### Add a data context

ASP.Net Web API projects use the model view controller (MVC) pattern. Next create a data context that coordinates serving up the data from the data model, and a controller that handles the HTTP requests and creates the HTTP response.

To add the data context class, in the solution explorer right click **ToDoService** and then **Add** > **Class**.
In the **Add New Item** dialog that appears, ensure that **Class** is selected, and set the **Name** to `Datacontext.cs`, and click **Add**.

In **Datacontext.cs**, replace the contents of the empty 'class DataContext' with the following:

```csharp
public static class DataContext
{
    public static Model.ToDoList ToDoList { get; } = new Model.ToDoList("Azure learning List");

    static DataContext()
    {
        ToDoList = new Model.ToDoList("Main List");

        // Seed to-do list

        ToDoList.Add(Model.ToDoItem.Load("Learn about microservices", 0, true));
        ToDoList.Add(Model.ToDoItem.Load("Learn about Service Fabric", 1, true));
        ToDoList.Add(Model.ToDoItem.Load("Learn about Service Fabric Mesh", 2, false));
    }
}
```

This is a minimal data context that primarily populates some sample to-do items and provides access to the list of to-do items.

### Add a controller

When we created the **ToDoService** project, a default controller was provided by the template. In the **Solution Explorer**, open the **Controllers** folder and you wil see the **ValuesController.cs** file. We will repurpose that file to be the to-do items controller.

Right-click **ValuesController.cs** and then **Rename**. Rename the file to  `ToDoController.cs`. If a prompt to rename all references appears, click **Yes**.

Add the following `using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;` to the top of the file and replace the contents of `class ToDoController` with the following:

```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ToDoController : Controller
{
    // GET api/todo
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Model.ToDoItem> Get()
    {
        return DataContext.ToDoList.Items;
    }

    // GET api/todo/5
    [HttpGet("{index}")]
    public Model.ToDoItem Get(int index)
    {
        return DataContext.ToDoList.Items.ElementAt(index);
    }

    //// POST api/values
    //[HttpPost]
    //public void Post([FromBody]string value)
    //{
    //}

    //// PUT api/values/5
    //[HttpPut("{id}")]
    //public void Put(int id, [FromBody]string value)
    //{
    //}

    // DELETE api/values/5
    [HttpDelete("{index}")]
    public void Delete(int index)
    {
    }
}
```

For this tutorial, we won't implement add, delete, etc. but will simply focus on retrieving the to-do data.

## Create the web page that displays to-do items

Now that we have the back-end service implemented, let's code the web site that will display it. So we return to the **WebFrontEnd** project.

The web page that displays the to-do items needs access to the **ToDoItem** class and list. Add a reference to the Model project in the **Solution Explorer** by right-clicking **WebFrontEnd** and selecting **Add** > **Reference...** The **Reference Manager** dialog will appear.

In the **Reference Manager**, select the checkbox for **Model**, and click **OK**.

In the **Solution Explorer**, open the Index.cshtml page by navigating to **WebFrontEnd** > **Pages** > **Index.cshtml**. Open **Index.cshtml**.

Replace the contents of the entire file with:

```HTML
@page
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

<div>
    <table class="table-bordered">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Done?</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var item in Model.Items)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>@item.Description</td>
                    <td>@item.Completed</td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
```

This defines a simple table that displays the to-do items. Now open the code behind for the Index page in the **Solution Explorer** by double-clicking on **Index.cshtml** and then opening **Index.cshtml.cs**.

At the top of **Index.cshtml.cs**, add the following using statement: `using System.Net.Http;`

Replace the contents of `public class IndexModel` with the following:

```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public Model.ToDoItem[] Items = new Model.ToDoItem[] { };

    public void OnGet()
    {
        HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

        using (HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(backendUrl).GetAwaiter().GetResult())
        {
            if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
            {
                Items = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Model.ToDoItem[]>(response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result);
            }
        }
    }

    private static string backendDNSName = $"{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ServiceName")}.{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ApiHostName")}";
    private static Uri backendUrl = new Uri($"http://{backendDNSName}:{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ApiHostPort")}/api/todo");
}
```

### Set environment variables

To communicate with the back-end service, we need to specify the URL for that service. For the purpose of this tutorial, this is done via environment variables that are read with the following code that we added above:

```csharp
private static string backendDNSName = $"{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ServiceName")}.{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AppName")}";
private static Uri backendUrl = new Uri($"http://{backendDNSName}:{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ApiHostPort")}/api/todo");
```

The URL is comprised of the application name, the service name, and the port. All of this information is found in the service.yaml file found in the **ToDoService** project. Navigate in **Solution Explorer** to the **ToDoService** project and open **Service Resources** > **service.yaml**.

![Figure 1 - The ToDoService service.yaml file](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-serviceyaml-port.png)

* The app name (`ServiceFabricMeshApp`) is found under `application:` after `name:` See (1) in the figure above.
* The service name (`ToDoService`) is found under `services:` after `name:` See (2) in the figure above.
* The port (`20006`) is found under `endpoints:` after `port:` See (3) in the figure above.

Now that we have the app name, service name, and port number, we can create the environment variables that the app will use to communicate with the back-end service.

In **Solution Explorer**, navigate  to **WebFrontEnd** > **Service Resources** > **service.yaml** so that we can define the variables that specify the back-end service address.

In the service.yaml file, add the following under `environmentVariables:` (be careful to use spaces, not tabs, when you indent these or the file will fail validation during compile):

``` xml
- name: AppName
    value: ServiceFabricMeshApp
- name: ApiHostPort
    value: 20006
- name: ServiceName
    value: ToDoService
```

It should look something like this (although your `ApiHostPort` value will probably be different):

![Service.yaml in the WebFrontEnd project](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-serviceyaml-envvars.png)

We are now ready to build and deploy the image the Service Fabric app, along with the back-end web service, to your local cluster.

## Build and debug on your local cluster

A Docker image is automatically built and deployed to your local cluster as soon as your project loads. This process may take a while. You can monitor the progress in the Visual Studio **Output** pane if you set the Output pane's **Show output from:** drop-down list to **Service Fabric Tools**.

Press **F5** to compile and run your service locally. Whenever the project is run and debugged locally, Visual Studio will:

* Make sure that Docker for Windows is running and set to use Windows as the container operating system.
* Download any missing Docker base images. This part may take some time
* Build (or rebuild) the Docker image used to host your code project.
* Deploy and run the container on the local Service Fabric development cluster.
* Run your services and hit any breakpoints you have set.

After the local deployment is finished, and Visual Studio is running your app, a browser window will open to a default sample webpage.

**Debugging tips**

* If you get a Visual Studio error that "No Service Fabric local cluster is running", ensure that the Service Local Custer Manager (SLCM) is running. Then right-click the SLCM icon in the task bar, and click **Start Local Cluster**. Once it has started, in Visual Studio press **F5** again.
* If you get a 404 when the app starts, it probably means that your environment variables in service.yaml are not set correctly. Ensure that the ApiHostName and ApiHostPort are set correctly per the instructions in [Set environment variables](#set-environment-variables).
* If you get a build error on the service.yaml file, ensure that you used spaces and not tabs when you added the environment variables.

### Debug in Visual Studio

When you dbug a Service Fabric mesh application in Visual Studio, you are using a local Service Fabric development cluster. To see how to-do items are retrieved from the back-end service, we will debug into the OnGet() method.
1. In the **WebFrontEnd** project, open **Pages** > **Index.cshtml** > **Index.cshtml.cs** and set a breakpoint in the web API's **Get** method (line 17).
2. In the **ToDoService** project, open **TodoController.cs** and set a breakpoint in the web API's **Get** method (line 16).
3. Go back to the browser and refresh the page. You hit the  breakpoint in the web front-end's `OnGet()` method. You can inspect the `backendUrl` variable to see how the environment variables that you defined in the **service.yaml** file are combined into the URL used to contact the back-end service.
4. Step over (F10) the `client.GetAsync(backendUrl).GetAwaiter().GetResult())` call and you will hit the controller's `Get()` breakpoint. In this method you can see how the list of to-do items is retrieved from the in-memory list.
5. When you are done looking around you can stop debugging your project in Visual Studio by pressing **Shift+F5**.

## Publish to Azure

To publish your Service Fabric Mesh project to Azure, right-click on **ServiceFabricMeshApp** in Visual studio and select **Publish...**

Next, you will see a **Publish Service Fabric Application** dialog.

![Visual studio Service Fabric Mesh publish dialog](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-publish-dialog.png)

Select your Azure account and subscription. Choose a **Location**. This article uses **East US**.

Under **Resource group**, select **\<Create New Resource Group...>**. This will show you a dialog where you will create a new resource group. Choose the **East US** location and name the group **sfmeshTutorial1RG**. Press **Create** to create the resource group and return to the publish dialog.

![Visual studio Service Fabric Mesh new resource group dialog](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-publish-new-resource-group-dialog.png)

Back in the **Publish Service Fabric Application** dialog, under **Azure Container Registry**, select **\<Create New Container Registry...>**. In the **Create Container Registry** dialog, use a unique name for the **Container registry name**. For **Location**, pick **East US**. Select the **sfmeshTutorial1RG** resource group. Set the **SKU** to **Basic** and then press **Create** to return to the publish dialog.

![Visual studio Service Fabric Mesh new resource group dialog](media/service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-dotnetcore/visual-studio-publish-new-container-registry-dialog.png)

In the publish dialog, press the **Publish** button to deploy your Service Fabric application to Azure.

When you publish to Azure for the first time, it can take up to 10 or more minutes. Subsequent publishes of the same project generally take around five minutes. Obviously, these estimates will vary based on your internet connection speed and other factors. You can monitor the progress of the deployment by selecting the **Service Fabric Tools** pane in the Visual Studio **Output** window. Once the deployment has finished, the **Service Fabric Tools** output will display the IP address and port of your application in the form of a URL.

```json
Packaging Application...
Building Images...
Web1 -> C:\Code\ServiceFabricMeshApp\ToDoService\bin\Any CPU\Release\netcoreapp2.0\ToDoService.dll
Uploading the images to Azure Container Registy...
Deploying application to remote endpoint...
The application was deployed successfully and it can be accessed at http://10.000.38.000:20000.
```

Open a web browser and navigate to the URL to see the website running in Azure.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete all of the resources you created. Since you created a new resource group to host both the ACR and Service Fabric Mesh service resources, you can safely delete this resource group.

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group sfmeshTutorial1RG
```

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name sfmeshTutorial1RG
```

Alternatively, you can delete the resource group [from the portal](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal.md#delete-resource-group-or-resources).
