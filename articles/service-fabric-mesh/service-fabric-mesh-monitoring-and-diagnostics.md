# Monitoring and diagnostics
Azure Service Fabric Mesh is a fully managed service enabling developers to deploy containerized applications without managing virtual machines, storage, or networking resources. Monitoring and diagnostics for Service Fabric Mesh is catagorized into three main types of diagnostics data:

1. Application logs - these are defined as the logs from your containerized applications, based on how you have instrumented your application (docker logs)
2. Platform events - events from the SeaBreeze platform relevant to your container operation, currently including container activation, deactivation, termination.
3. Container metrics - resource utilization and performance metrics for your containers (docker stats)

This article discusses the monitoring and diagnostics options for the latest preview version available.

## Application logs

You can view your docker logs from your deployed containers, on a per container basis. In the Service Fabric Mesh application model, each container is a code package in your application. To see the associated logs with a code package, use the following command:

```cli
az mesh codepackage logs --resource-group <nameOfResourceGroup> --app-name <nameOfCGS> --service-name <nameOfService> --replica-name <nameOfReplica> --code-package-name <nameOfCodePackage>
```

*Note: currently, replica names are incrementing numbers from 0.*

Here is what this looks like for seeing the logs from the VotingWeb.Code container from the voting application:

```cli
az mesh codepackage logs --resource-group <RG> --app-name SbzVoting --service-name VotingWeb --replica-name 0 --code-package-name VotingWeb.Code
```

## Platform events

Here is a list of current events exposed in the platform, with a brief description: 

* ContainerActivated: container successfully created and started
* ContainerDeactivated – container stopped
* ContainerTerminated – container exited with status (could be 'success' or 'error'). The container will be restarted automatically. 

Currently, events can be viewed at a service replica level. Here is the CLI command to view container events. 

```cli
az mesh servicereplica show <nameOfResourceGroup> --app-name <nameOfCGS> --service-name <nameOfService> --replica-name <nameOfReplica>
```

Here is what this looks like for seeing events for the VotingWeb service deployed in the voting application:

```cli
az mesh servicereplica show --resource-group <RG> --app-name SbzVoting --service-name VotingWeb --replica-name 0 
```
