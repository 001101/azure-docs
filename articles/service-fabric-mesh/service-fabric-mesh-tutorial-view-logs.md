## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial:

* Deploy the to-do app. If you have not done that yet, follow the instructions in [Publish the app to Azure](service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-service-fabric-mesh-app.md).

## See the application logs

JTW: We should be clear on what scenarios we recommend this for. App Insights can be used for Application level telemetry and container logs I believe? But customers wonâ€™t be able to get container lifecycle events nor performance counters with this solution. So basically they can only get diagnostics from within their application and app insights is an option they can use. 


Examine the logs for the deployed to-do app:

```azurecli-interactive
az mesh code-package-log get --resource-group $rg --application-name ServiceMeshApp --service-name todoservice --replica-name 0 --code-package-name ServiceMeshApp
```

JTW: To view the logs of your own app, supply the value for the  your resource group in place of `$rg` ...
