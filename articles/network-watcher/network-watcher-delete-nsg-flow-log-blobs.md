# Delete network security group flow log storage blobs in Network Watcher

This article describes how to manually delete network security group (NSG) flow logs storage blobs that have a non-zero retention policy using an Azure PowerShell script.

[Network security group flow logs](network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview.md) are a feature of Network Watcher that allows you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through an NSG. Flow logs are stored within a storage account and are maintained based on the value set for the retention policy. You can set log retention policy from one day to 2,147,483,647 days. If a retention policy is not set, the logs are maintained forever.

Retention policies on NSG flow logs were recently turned off. As a result, storage blobs created by NSG Flow logs will no longer be automatically deleted. If you have an existing non-zero retention policy, we recommend you periodically delete the storage blobs that are past their retention period to avoid  incurring any charges. 

## Delete NSG flow logs from storage account using Azure PowerShell
 
1. Download and save the following script to the current working directory or relevant path folders. 

```powershell
# This powershell script deletes all NSG flow log blobs that should not be retained anymore as per configured retention policy.
# While configuring NSG flow logs on Azure portal, the user configures the retention period of NSG flow log blobs in
# their storage account (in days).
# This script reads all blobs and deletes blobs that are not to be retained (outside retention window)
# if the retention days are zero; all blobs are retained forever and hence no blobs are deleted.
#

{
    # Query Flow Log Status which are enabled
    $NsgFlowLog = Get-AzNetworkWatcherFlowLogStatus -NetworkWatcher $NW -TargetResourceId $Nsg.Id | Where-Object {$_.Enabled -eq "True"}

            Write-Output ($Blob.Name + '===>' + $BlobLastModifietedDTinUTC  + ' ===> RETAINED')
        }
    }
}

Write-Output ('Retention policy for all NSGs evaluated and completed successfully')

```
2. Enter the following parameters in the script as needed:
    1. SubscriptionId [Mandatory]: The subscription ID from where you would like to delete NSG Flow Log blobs.
    2. Location [Mandatory]: The _location string_ of the region of the NSGs for which you would like to delete NSG Flow Log blobs. You can view this information on the Azure portal or from the [list here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-extensions-cli/blob/beb3d3fe984cfa9c7798cb11a274c5337968cbc5/regions.go#L23).
    3. Confirm [Optional]: Pass the confirm flag if you want to manually confirm the deletion of each storage blob.
3. Run the saved script as follows. In the following example, the script was saved as **Delete-NsgFlowLogsBlobs.ps1**:
     ```
    .\Delete-NsgFlowLogsBlobs.ps1 -SubscriptionId "99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999" -Location  "eastus2euap" -Confirm
    ```
