# Traffic analytics

Traffic analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application activity in cloud networks. Traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher network security group (NSG) flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. With traffic analytics, you can:

- Visualize network activity across your Azure subscriptions and identify hot spots.
- Identify security threats to, and secure your network, with information such as open-ports, applications attempting internet access, and virtual machines (VM) connecting to rogue networks.
- Understand traffic flow patterns across Azure regions and the internet to optimize your network deployment for performance and capacity.
- Pinpoint network misconfigurations leading to failed connections in your network.

# Fields used in Traffic Analytics Queries

Traffic Analytics is built on top of Log Analytics, so you can run custom queries on data decorated by Traffic Analytics and set alerts on the same.

Listed below are the fields in the schema and what they signify

| Field | Format | Comments | 
|---------|--------- |---------|
| TableName	| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL |	
| SubType_s	| FlowLog |	Subtype for the flow logs |
| FASchemaVersion_s |	1	| Flow log schema version |
| TimeProcessed_t	| Date and Time in UTC	| Time at which the Network Watcher traffic analytics processed the raw flow logs from the storage account |
| FlowIntervalStartTime_t |	Date and Time in UTC |	Starting time of the flow log processing interval. This is time from which flow interval is measured |
| FlowIntervalEndTime_t	| Date and Time in UTC | Ending time of the flow log processing interval |
| FlowStartTime_t |	Date and Time in UTC |	First occurrence of such an aggregated flow (same four tuple) in the flow log processing interval between “FlowIntervalStartTime_t” and “FlowIntervalEndTime_t”. This gets aggregated based on aggregation logic |
| FlowEndTime_t | Date and Time in UTC | Last occurrence of the aggregated flow (same four tuple) in the flow log processing interval between “FlowIntervalStartTime_t” and “FlowIntervalEndTime_t”. In terms of flow log v2, this field contains the time when the last flow with the same four-tuple started (marked as “B” in the raw flow record) |

# Notes
    
    1. All flows that happened between “FlowIntervalStartTime_t” and “FlowIntervalEndTime_t” and captured in the storage account will be processed by Network watcher traffic analytics service. As of now, the default processing interval is 60 minutes and always this processing interval aligns with the hour interval. Processing interval never spans across hours.
    2. Network watcher traffic analytics exposes intervals at which the NSG flow logs should be processed. Default processing interval is 60 minutes.
    3. Aggregation Logic - In network watcher traffic analytics, we aggregate flows that have the same Source IP, Destination IP, Destination port and Transport layer protocol (TCP or UDP) (Note: Source port is excluded for aggregation). FlowStartTime_t field indicates the first occurrence of such an aggregated flow (same four tuple) in the flow log processing interval between “FlowIntervalStartTime_t” and “FlowIntervalEndTime_t”
    4. In case of AzurePublic and ExternalPublic flows, the customer owned azure VM IP is populated in this field, while the Public IP addresses are being populated in the PublicIPs_s field. For these two flow types, we should use VMIP_s and PublicIPs_s instead of SrcIP_s and DestIP_s fields. For AzurePublic and ExternalPublicIP addresses, we aggregate further, so that the number of records ingested to customer log analytics workspace is minimal.(This field will be deprecated soon and we should be using SrcIP_ and DestIP_s depending on whether azure VM was the source or the destination in the flow)
    5. Details for flow types : Based on the IP addresses involved in the flow, we categorize the flows in to the following flow types.
