# Data residency for Azure Network Watcher
With the exception of the Connection Monitor (Preview) service, Azure Network Watcher doesn't store customer data.


## Connection Monitor (Preview) data residency
The Connection Monitor (Preview) service stores customer data. This data is automatically stored by Network Watcher in a single region. So Connection Monitor (Preview) automatically satisfies in-region data residency requirements, including requirements specified on the [Trust Center](https://azuredatacentermap.azurewebsites.net/).

## Singapore data residency

In Azure, the feature that enables storing customer data in a single region is currently available only in the Southeast Asia Region (Singapore) of the Asia Pacific geo. For all other regions, customer data is stored in geo. For more information, see the [Trust Center](https://azuredatacentermap.azurewebsites.net/).

> [!Note]
> **Prior replication**
>
> You can store your customers' IP addresses with your Network Watcher instance so that Network Watcher can monitor reachability, latency, and network topology changes related to these customer IP addresses. These customer IP addresses might be classified as customer data. As of July 15, 2020, Network Watcher stored this data in a single region. Customer data, including this data, is no longer being replicated to Hong Kong. This customer data is and was encrypted at rest.
> 
> If this customer data were accessed by a third party, the third party would know the IP address but would not be able to access the machine or device associated with the IP address. We don't believe that any third parties have accessed this customer data in Hong Kong.
