# Tutorial: Deploy Azure Digital Twins and configure a spatial graph

Azure Digital Twins service allows you to bring together people, places and devices in a coherant spatial system. This series of tutorials demonstrate how to use the Digital Twins to detect room occupancy with optimal conditions of temperature and air quality. This will walk you through a scenario of a sample building, containing multiple floors and rooms within each floor. The rooms contain devices with sensors to detect motion, ambient temperature and air quality in the form of carbon dioxide. This series will show you how to represent the rooms in the building to the Digital Twins service, as well as how to connect the sensors to this service, so you can monitor the data coming in near real-time. As an occupant or user of the sample building, you can use this information to book meeting rooms with optimal conditions. 

In the first tutorial of this series, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy your Digital Twins instance
> * Allow application to connect to Digital Twins
> * Download and explore the Digital Twins sample
> * Provision your spatial graph

If you don’t have an Azure account, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

Note that if you already have completed the [Quickstart to find available rooms and monitor air quality](quickstart-view-occupancy-dotnet.md) and still have all your Digital Twins resources, you may proceed to [Tutorial to receive notifications from your Azure Digital Twins setup](tutorial-facilities-events.md) to learn how to create notifications from your setup. If you haven't provisioned your Digital Twins spatial graph, then use this tutorial to provision as well as modify your sample graph. 

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) should be installed on your development machine.

<a id="deploy" />
## Deploy your Digital Twins instance

Use the steps in this section to create a new instance of the Digital Twins service. 

[!INCLUDE [create-digital-twins-portal](../../includes/create-digital-twins-portal.md)]


## Allow application to connect to Digital Twins

Digital Twins uses [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) to control access to the service. Grant access rights to your application using the steps in this section.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-permissions](../../includes/digital-twins-permissions.md)]


## Download and explore the Digital Twins sample

### Download the sample
1. Open [the Digital Twins .Net sample app](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples-csharp) in a browser, click **Clone or download**, and then click **Download ZIP**. 
2. Copy the ZIP folder to a new folder on your machine, and extract the contents. 

### Explore the sample
The sample allows you to configure and provision a spatial intelligence graph. The *occupancy-quickstart/src* folder contains the following:
- *models*: Explore the code in this folder. This replicates the object model used by the Digital Twins, for spaces and other resources. 
- *api*: This folder contains wrapper functions for Digital Twins REST APIs. This is not a complete library. For a complete list of features, visit [this sample Digital Twins swagger URL](https://docs.westcentralus.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger) or the URL that you copied after [deploying your instance](#deploy) above.
- *actions*: The code in this folder performs advanced tasks using the Digital Twins REST APIs, for example:
    - provision your spatial graph using the *provisionSample.cs*,
    - get information about the provisioned spaces using the *getSpaces.cs*,
    - get the results of a sample custom function called user-defined function with the *getAvailableAndFreshSpaces.cs*, and
    - create endpoints to interact with other services using the *createEndpoints.cs*, among other things.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To prevent unauthorized access to your Digital Twins management API, the sample requires you to sign in with your Azure account credentials every time you run it. It will direct you to a Sign-in page, and give a session-specific code to enter on that page. Follow the prompts to sign in with your Azure account.


### Configure the sample
1. Open a command window, and navigate to the *digital-twins-samples-csharp-master/occupancy-quickstart/src* in the downloaded sample folder.
2. Run `dotnet restore` to restore dependencies to the sample project.
3. In the same folder, open the *appSettings.json* file, and update the following values:
    1. *ClientId*: Enter the *Application ID* of your AAD app registration, noted in the preceding section.
    1. *Tenant*: Enter the *Directory Id* of your [AAD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant), also noted in the previous section.
    1. *BaseUrl*: The *Management API* URL of your Digital Twins instance, which will be in the following format, `https://yourDigitalTwinsName.yourLocation.azuresmartspaces.net/management/api/v1.0/`.
4. Run `dotnet run` to see a list of Digital Twins features that you can explore using the sample.

## Provision your spatial graph
This section shows how to provision a spatial graph for a sample building, using the sample we downloaded in the previous section.

- Navigate to the *src\actions* folder in the sample. Open the file *provisionSample.cs* in an editor and note the following function.

```csharp
public static async Task<IEnumerable<ProvisionResults.Space>> ProvisionSample(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger logger)
{
    IEnumerable<SpaceDescription> spaceCreateDescriptions;
    using (var r = new StreamReader("actions/provisionSample.yaml"))
    {
        spaceCreateDescriptions = await GetProvisionSampleTopology(r);
    }

    var results = await CreateSpaces(httpClient, logger, spaceCreateDescriptions, Guid.Empty);

    Console.WriteLine($"Completed Provisioning: {JsonConvert.SerializeObject(results, Formatting.Indented)}");

    return results;
}

```
This function uses the *provisionSample.yaml* in the same folder to provision a spatial graph of an imaginary building. Open this *yaml* file in your editor, and note the hierarchy of rooms, sensors and devices in the building. Each of the entry is of a predefined `type` or a Digital Twin object, for example, *Venue*, *Floor*, *Area*, *Room*. A spatial intelligence graph for a particular *space* is built using the  objects relevant to that space. For a building, the objects or types used in the *provisionSample.yaml* will be sufficient. A spatial graph for a different type of space, like a factory or a mine, will use a different set of objects that is more relevant. The Digital Twins service provides you with a few predefined sets of objects: `Default`, `BACnet`, `SmartGrid`, and `Advanced`. The `Default` set of objects is loaded by default, and provides generic names for most types (ex: Temperature for SensorDataType, Map for SpaceBlobType, Active for SpaceStatus, etc.) and space types (ex: Space Type Room and Space Subtypes FocusRoom, ConferenceRoom, BathRoom, etc.). You can see which sets are loaded or available by running the command `dotnet run GetOntologies` in the command line for the sample. For more details on spatial graphs and the object model that builds it, read [Understanding Digital Twins Object Model and Spatial Intelligence Graph](concepts-objectmodel-spatialgraph.md). 

### Configure your spatial intelligence graph
The *provisionSample.yaml* contains an easy-to-visualize sample spatial graph. It contains the following nodes:

- **resources**: The `resources` node lets you create an IoT Hub resource to communicate with the devices in your setup. You would typically create an IoT hub at the root node of your graph, so that all the devices and sensors in that hierarchy can send telemetry to the same IoT hub.  

- **spaces**: In the Digital Twins object model, `spaces` represent the physical locations. Each space has a `Type`, e.g. *Region*, *Venue*, or a *Customer*, and a friendly `Name`. Spaces can belong to other spaces creating a hierarchical structure. The *provisionSample.yaml* has a spatial graph of an imaginary building. Note the logical nesting of spaces of type `Floor` within the `Venue`, `Area` in a floor, and `Room` in an area. 

- **devices**: Spaces can contain `devices`, which are physical or virtual entities that manage a number of sensors. For example, a device could be a user’s phone, a Raspberry Pi sensor pod, a gateway, etc. In the imaginary building in your sample, note how the room named *Focus Room* contains a *Raspberry Pi 3 A1* device. Each device node is identified by a unique `hardwareId`.

- **sensors**: A device can contain multiple `sensors`, which can detect and record physical changes like temperature, motion, battery level, etc. Note that the *provisionSample.yaml* file has two devices to record *Motion* and *CarbonDioxide*. Add another sensor to record *Temperature*, by adding the following lines, below the lines for the CarbonDioxide sensor:
```yaml
        - dataType: Temperature
          hardwareId: SAMPLE_SENSOR_TEMPERATURE
```

Save and close the *provisionSample.yaml* file. In the next tutorial, you will add more information to this file, and then complete the provisioning of your Azure Digital Twins sample building.


## Clean up resources

If you wish to stop exploring Azure Digital Twins beyond this point, feel free to delete resources created in this tutorial:

1. From the left-hand menu in the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com), click **All resources**, select and **Delete** your Digital Twins resource group.
2. If you need to, you may proceed to delete the sample application on your work machine as well. 


## Next steps

Proceed to the next tutorial in the series to learn how to create a custom *user-defined function* to monitor conditions in your sample building.
