# Tutorial: Set up and provision Azure Digital Twins 

Azure Digital Twins service allows you to bring together people, places and devices in a coherant spatial system. This series of tutorials demonstrate how to use the Digital Twins to detect room occupancy with optimal conditions of temperature and air quality. This will walk you through a scenario of a sample building, containing multiple floors and rooms within each floor. The rooms contain devices with sensors to detect motion, ambient temperature and air quality in the form of carbon dioxide. This series will show you how to represent the rooms in the building to the Digital Twins service, as well as how to connect the sensors to this service, so you can monitor the data coming in near real-time. As a facilities administrator, you can use this information to book meeting rooms with optimal conditions. 

In the first tutorial of this series, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy your Digital Twins instance
> * Permit your application to connect to Digital Twins
> * Download and explore the Digital Twins sample
> * Provision your spaces and devices

If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) should be installed on your development machine.


## Deploy your Digital Twins instance

Create a new instance of the Digital Twins in the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the steps in this section. 

[!INCLUDE [create-digital-twins-portal](../../includes/create-digital-twins-portal.md)]


## Permit your application to connect to Digital Twins

Digital Twins uses [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) to control access to the service. Grant access rights to your application using the steps in this section.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-permissions](../../includes/digital-twins-permissions.md)]


## Download and explore the Digital Twins sample

### Download the sample
[Download or clone the Digital Twins .Net sample app](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples-csharp) from Github. To clone the sample using a Git client, run the following command: 
```cmd/sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples-csharp.git
``` 

### Explore the sample
The sample allows you to configure and provision a spatial topology. Take your time to explore the contents of the *src* folder and notice the following folders:
- *models*: Explore the code in this folder and notice how this replicates the object model used by the Digital Twins, for spaces and other resources. 
- *api*: This folder contains wrapper functions for Digital Twins REST APIs. This is not a complete library. For a complete list of features, visit the swagger URL created for your Digital Twins instance which has this format: `yourDigitalTwinsName.yourLocation.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger`.
- *actions*: The code in this folder performs advanced tasks using the Digital Twins REST APIs, for example:
    - provision your spatial graph using the *provisionSample.cs*, and
    - get information about the provisioned spaces using the *getSpaces.cs*. 

### Configure the sample
1. In a command window, navigate to the *digital-twins-samples-csharp-master\occupancy-quickstart\src* in the Digital Twins sample.
2. Run `dotnet restore` to restore dependencies to the sample project.
3. Open the *appSettings.json* file and update the following values:
    a. *ClientId*: Enter the AAD application id that you noted in the preceding section.
    b. *Tenant*: Enter the *Directory Id* of your [AAD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant).
    c. *BaseUrl*: The URL of your Digital Twins instance, which will be in the following format, `https://[yourDigitalTwinsName].[yourLocation].azuresmartspaces.net/management/api/v1.0/`.
4. Run `dotnet run` to see a list of Digital Twins features that you can explore using the sample.


## Provision your spaces and devices
In this section, we will learn how to provision a spatial graph for a Smart Building using the .Net sample we downloaded in the previous sections.

- Navigate to the *src\actions* folder in the .Net sample. Open the file *provisionSample.cs* in an editor and note the following function.

```csharp
public static async Task<IEnumerable<ProvisionResults.Space>> ProvisionSample(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger logger)
{
    IEnumerable<SpaceDescription> spaceCreateDescriptions;
    using (var r = new StreamReader("actions/provisionSample.yaml"))
    {
        spaceCreateDescriptions = await GetProvisionSampleTopology(r);
    }

    var results = await CreateSpaces(httpClient, logger, spaceCreateDescriptions, Guid.Empty);

    Console.WriteLine($"Completed Provisioning: {JsonConvert.SerializeObject(results, Formatting.Indented)}");

    return results;
}

```
This function uses the *provisionSample.yaml* in the same folder to start provisioning a spatial graph. 

- Open the file *provisionSample.yaml* in your editor. Note the plan of rooms, sensors and devices in a fictitious building. Each of the entry is of a predefined `type` or a Digital Twin object, for example, *Venue*, *Floor*, *Area*, *Room*. A spatial intelligence graph for a particular *space* is built using the  objects relevant to that space. For example, for a regular building, the objects or types used in the provisionSample.yaml will be sufficient. For a spatial graph for another type of space, for example, a factory or a mine, a different set of objects make sense. For more detailed information on spatial graphs and the object model that builds it, read the [Understanding Digital Twins Object Model and Spatial Intelligence Graph](concepts-objectmodel-spatialgraph.md).

- The *provisionSample.yaml* contains an easy-to-visualize sample spatial graph. The `resources` node lets you create an IoT hub to communicate with the devices in your setup. You would typically create an IoT Hub resource at the root node of your graph, which here is `Venue` type. Since this graph is relevant to a Smart Building application, notice how objects of type `spaces` are nested within each other as logical nesting of `Floor`, `Area` in that floor, and a `Room` in that area. Some of the space objects can have subtypes relevant to a particular building. For a particular `space`, for example a conference room, you could add objects of type `devices`, which are identified by a unique `hardwareId`, and a device will have `sensors` to detect physical changes like temperature or motion. Try adding more spaces, devices and sensors at any level in this graph to better suit your sample scenario. For example, add a second conference room entry below the first one:
```yaml
   - name: Conference Room 2
      type: Room
      subType: ConferenceRoom
```

- Run `dotnet run ProvisionSample` at the command line to provision your spatial topology. Observe the messages in the command window and notice how your spatial graph gets created. Notice how it creates an IoT hub at the root node or the `Venue`. 
- From the output in the command window, copy the value of the `ConnectionString`, under the `Devices` section, to your clipboard. You will need this value to simulate the device connection in the following tutorial.


## Clean up resources

If you wish to stop exploring Azure Digital Twins beyond this point, feel free to delete resources created in this tutorial:

1. From the left-hand menu in the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com), click **All resources**, select and **Delete** your Digital Twins resource group.
2. If you need to, you may proceed to delete the sample application on your work machine as well. 


## Next steps

Proceed to the next tutorial in the series to learn how to create customized code or User-Defined Functions to monitor conditions in your sample building.
