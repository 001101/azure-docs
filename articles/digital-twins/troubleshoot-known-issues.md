# Known issues in Azure Digital Twins

This article provides information about known issues associated with Azure Digital Twins.

## Managing event routes in the Azure portal

If you are signed into the portal with a personal [**Microsoft account (MSA)**](https://account.microsoft.com/account/Account), such as an *@outlook.com* account, you will see a screen saying *You need permission to view event routes* when attempting to manage event routes in the portal, regardless of your permission level.

### Troubleshooting steps

Users who are currently unable to manage event routes in the portal can still manage event routes using the Azure Digital Twins APIs or CLI. Switching to one of these tools for event route management is the recommended strategy to mitigate this issue.

The instructions for this can be found in [*How-to: Manage endpoints and routes*](how-to-manage-routes).

### Possible causes

You are signed into the portal with a personal [Microsoft account (MSA)](https://account.microsoft.com/account/Account), such as an *@outlook.com* account. Managing event routes in the Azure portal is currently only available to Azure users on corporate-domain accounts.
