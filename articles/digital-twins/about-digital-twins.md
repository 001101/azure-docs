# Overview: What is Azure Digital Twins?

Azure Digital Twins is a service in the Azure IoT Platform that allows you to create a comprehensive model of the physical environment. It provides a spatial intelligence graph to model the relationships and interactions between people, space, and devices.

Azure Digital Twins can be used to query data for a space rather than from many sensors. You can therefore build repeatable, scalable, spatially aware, experiences that are uniquely relevant because of their ability to correlate data across the digital and physical world.

Azure Digital Twins applies to environments of all types including such as offices, schools, hospitals, banks, stadiums, factories, parking lots, parks, electrical grids, and cities. Example use cases are predicting maintenance needs, analyzing energy requirements, and optimizing the use of available space.

## Key Capabilities

Key capabilities of Azure Digital Twins include:

* **Spatial intelligence graph**: a virtual representation of the physical environment that enables you to model the relationships among people, places, and devices.
* **Pre-loaded domain-specific concepts (Digital Twin Object Models)**: pre-defined device protocols and data schema that are aligned your solution’s domain-specific needs to accelerate and simplify development.
* **Multi and nested tenancy**: build solutions that scale and securely replicate across multiple tenants or create multiple sub-tenants that can be accessed and used in an isolated and secure manner.
* **Advanced compute capabilities**: define and run custom functions against incoming telemetry messages to send signals to pre-defined endpoints.
* **Built-in access control**: access and identity management features such as Role-Based Access Control and Azure Active Directory enable you to securely control individuals’ and devices’ access. You can also perform specific actions within the Digital Twin environment.
* **Ecosystem**: connect an Azure Digital Twins instance to the broad set of Azure Analytics, AI, and Storage services, Azure Maps, Microsoft Mixed Reality, Dynamics 365, or Office 365.

## Solutions that Benefit from Azure Digital Twins

Azure Digital Twins is applicable to any industry or scenario that can benefit from virtually representing the physical world. Some examples include:

* Showing a property management company the occupancy levels of a space over time to glean insights about the best ways to configure its office building.
* Triggering work order tickets to a mobile app that drives security guard dispatch, janitorial services scheduling, and any other services in a retail space or sports venue.
* Showing a building occupant which rooms are occupied in a building in real time. Then, helping the occupant reserve workspaces and find colleagues.
* Tracking what assets are located within a space, or what assets are in a given space.
* Optimizing electric vehicle charging my modeling user preferences and energy-grid constraints.
