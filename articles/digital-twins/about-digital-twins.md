# What is Azure Digital Twins?

Digital Twins is an Azure IoT Cloud platform enabling IoT solutions to be built from distributed devices, sensors, and places.

Azure Digital Twins makes it easy to create a "digital twin" that effectively models the relationships between people, places, and devices. These predefined models, or **Ontology**, simplify building solutions unique to different industry domain.

Your "digital twins" will supply powerful real-time analytics and device telemetry, user-defined functions to automate event and data processing, and robust security for your IoT app.

## Services in Azure Digital Twins

From **Ontology's** pre-defined models to device **Telemetry**, many services combine to make the Azure Digital Twins platform.

### Object Ontology

A rich **Ontology** of pre-defined object models is provided to better categorize IoT assets and speed along development. These models simplify the representation of many familiar resources an IoT app will use.

These models can be used to simplify API interaction, represent data, or configure your app.

### Spatial Intelligence Graphs

IoT apps bring together numerous devices, sensors, and places. Azure Digital Twins unites these elements into a unified system.

For example, smart utility app might involve several electricity usage devices connected across a neighborhood. In order to accurately monitor electricity use and ensure correct billing, the smart utility company must track each device, sensor, and their locations.

Digital Twins enables these kinds of complex relationships between people, places, and devices to be easily defined through its powerful **Ontology** and situated into a contextual IoT space called a **Topology**.

### User-Defined Functions

**User-Defined Functions** can be specified for each node an IoT environment allowing custom, repeat, and automatic data processing.

**User-Defined Functions**  can be assigned for individual or grouped devices and sensors.

### Telemetry and Insights

Devices, sensors, and whole buildings can stream their data directly to your IoT app through Azure IoT Hub. IoT Hub provides powerful event data processing and a robust telemetry pipeline.

Using **Telemetry**, your app can collect temperature data from multiple sensors or calculate the current room capacity of an entire office building.
