# Azure Digital Twin public preview service limits

During Public Preview, Azure Digital Twins will have subscription, instance, and rate limits as described below.  

> [!NOTE]
> These limits will be increased and/or removed by General Availability (GA).

## Per-Subscription limits

During Public Preview, each Azure Subscription can create exactly one Azure Digital Twins instance.

> [!TIP]
> Deleting your instance will allow you to create a new one.

## Per-Instance limits

Each Azure Digital Twins instance can have:

- One `IoTHub` Resource
- One `EventHub` endpoint for event type DeviceMessage
- Up to three `EventHub`, `ServiceBus`, or `EventGrid` endpoints of event type `SensorChange`, `SpaceChange`, `TopologyOperation`, or `UdfCustom`

## Management API limits

The request rate limits for your Management API are:

- 100 requests per second to Management API
- A single Management API query can return up to 1000 objects

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you exceed the 1000 object limit, you will receive an error and will need to simplify your query.

## UDF Rate limits

The following limits cap the total number of all user-defined function calls made within your Azure Digital Twins instance:

- 400 client library calls per second
- 100 SendNotification calls per second

> [!NOTE]
> The following actions may cause additional rate limits to be applied temporarily:
> - Topology object metadata edits
> - UDF definition updates
> - Devices sending telemetry for the first time

## Device Telemetry limits

Your devices together may send up to 100 messages per second to your Azure Digital Twins instance.
