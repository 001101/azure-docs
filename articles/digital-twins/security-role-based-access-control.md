# Azure Digital Twins Role-Based Access Control

Digital Twins security enables precise access to specific resources and actions in your IoT topology. It does so through granular role and permission management called Digital Twins Role-Based Access Control.

Using Role-Based Access Control, permission can be granted to the specific user, users, or service principal as needed. Additionally, the degree of access can also be fine-tuned.

Role-Based Access Control is unique in that permissions are inherited down the topology tree.

## What can I do with Role-Based Access Control?

* Grant a user the ability to manage devices for an entire building, or only a particular room or floor
* Grant an admin global access to all topology nodes for an entire topology, or only a section
* Grant a support specialist read access to the topology, except for access keys
* Grant every member of a domain read access to all topology objects

## Role-Based Access Control best practices

>[!NOTE]
> Always follow the principle of least privilege: grant an identity only the amount of access needed to perform its job.

This is particularly important given the downward inheritance that is built into Role-Based Access Control.

Periodic auditing of role assignments is recommended.

It's also encouraged to perform a clean-up process as individuals change roles or assignments.

## Role-Based Access Control Components

Role-Based Access Control involves several pieces.

### Role definitions

A **role definition** is a collection of permissions and is sometimes just called a **role**.

A **role definition** lists the operations that can be performed. These include *read*, *write*, and *delete*. It also specifies a set of conditions that might exclude certain object types in the topology.

The following roles are available in Role-Based Access Control:

* Space Administrator: Global access able to perform all operations for the specified space and all nodes underneath
* User Administrator: CRUD for users and user related objects. Read for spaces.
* Device Administrator: CRUD for devices and device related objects. Read for spaces.
* Key Administrator: CRUD for access keys. Read for spaces.
* Token Administrator: Read and Update for access keys. Read for spaces.
* User: Read access for spaces, sensors, and users, including their corresponding related objects.
* Support Specialist: Read access for everything except access keys.
* Device Installer: Read and Update for devices and sensors, including their corresponding related objects. Read access for spaces.
* Gateway Device: Create access for sensors. Read access for devices and sensors, including their corresponding related objects.

*The full definitions for the above can be retrieved by querying the system/roles API.*

### Object Types

The `ObjectIdType` refers to the type of identity that is being given a role. Apart from the `DeviceId` and `UserDefinedFunctionId` types, the types correspond to a property of an Azure Active Directory (AAD) object:
  
* The UserId type assigns a role to a user.
* The DeviceId type assigns a role to a device.
* The DomainName type assigns a role to a domain name. Each user with the specified domain name will have the access rights of the corresponding role.
* The TenantId type assigns a role to a tenant. Each user belonging to the specified AAD tenant id will have the access rights of the corresponding role.
* The ServicePrincipalId type assigns a role to a service principal object id.
* The UserDefinedFunctionId type assigns a role to a User Defined Function (UDF)

To query for the object id for a user reference the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/get-azureaduser?view=azureadps-2.0).

To obtain the object id for a service principal reference the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/get-azurermadserviceprincipal?view=azurermps-6.8.1).

To retrieve the object id for an AAD tenant reference the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant).

## Role Assignments

Permissions are granted by created a role assignment, and revoked by removing a role assignment. A Digital Twins role assignment associates an object (user, AAD tenant, etc.), role, and a space. Permissions are then inherited by any child spaces.

For example, a user is given a role assignment with role DeviceInstaller for the root node of a topology, which represents a building. She then is able to read and update devices not only for that node, but all other child spaces in the building.
