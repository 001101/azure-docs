# Security best practices

Azure Digital Twins security enables precise access to specific resources and actions in your IoT topology. It does so through granular role and permission management called Role-Based Access Control.

Azure Digital Twins also leverages other security features present on Azure IoT including Azure Active Directory. For that reason, configuring your Digital Twins app involves using many of the same [Azure IoT security practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-fundamentals/iot-security-best-practices?context=azure/iot-hub/) currently recommended.

This article summarizes key best practices to follow.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Review additional security resources (including your device vendors) to ensure maximal security for your IoT space.

## IoT Security best practices

Some key practices to safely secure your IoT devices include:

* Secure each device that's connected to your IoT space in a tamper-proof way.
* Limit I/O and device bandwidth to improve performance. Rate-limiting and throttling can improve security by preventing denial-of-service attacks.
* Limit the role of each device, sensor, and person within your IoT space. If compromised, the impact is minimized.
* Potential use of device IP address filtering.

Some key practices to safely secure an IoT space include:

* Use powerful encryption wherever possible. That means requiring long passwords, using secure protocols, and two-factor authentication.
* Encrypt saved, stored, or persistent data.
* Require passwords or keys to be periodically changed or refreshed.
* Carefully restrict access and permissions by role (see Role-Based Access Control best practices below).

Monitoring IoT resources to watch for outliers, threats, or resource parameters that fall outside the range of usual operation is managed through Azure Analytics.

## Azure Active Directory best practices

Azure Digital Twins enforces an [OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) security flow through Azure Active Directory to authenticate to downstream APIs. Familiar best practices for securely interacting with APIs through OAuth 2.0 apply here as well. A few key practices to secure your IoT space for Azure Active Directory include:

* Limiting OAuth 2.0 scope of access for a token.
* Verifying the length of time a token is valid and whether a token remains valid.
* Setting appropriate lengths of time that tokens are valid for.
* Refreshing expired tokens.
