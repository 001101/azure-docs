# Routing events and messages

IoT solutions often stitch together several services including storage, analytics, and more. This article will describe how to connect your Azure Digital Twins instance to the broad set of Azure analytics, AI, and storage services, to bring deeper insights to your applications.

## Route types

Digital Twins offers two methods to integrate IoT events into other Azure services or business applications:

* **Routing Digital Twins events**: Digital Twins events can be triggered when an object in the spatial graph changes, when telemetry data is received, or when a User-Defined Function creates a notification based on predefined conditions. Users can send these events to [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/), [Service Bus topics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/), or [Event Grids](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/) for further processing.

* **Routing device telemetry**: In addition to routing events, Digital Twins can also route raw device telemetry messages to Event Hubs for further insights and analytics. These types of messages aren't processed by Digital Twins, and they are only forwarded to the Event Hub.

Users can specify one or more egress endpoints to send out events or to forward messages. Events and messages will be sent to the endpoints according to these predefined routing preferences. In other words, users can specify certain one endpoint to receive graph operation events, another to receive device telemetry events, and so on.

Routing to Event Hubs will maintain the order in which telemetry messages are sent, so that they arrive at the endpoint in the same sequence as they were originally received. Event Grid and Service Bus don't guarantee that endpoints will receive events in the same order that they occurred. However, the event schema does include a timestamp that can be used to identify the order after the events arrive at the endpoint.

## Route implementation

The Digital Twins service currently supports the following **EndpointTypes**:

- **EventHub**: is the Event Hub connection string endpoint.
- **ServiceBus**: is the Service Bus connection string endpoint.
- **EventGrid**: is the Event Grid connection string endpoint.

Digital Twins currently supports the following **EventTypes** that will be sent to the chosen endpoint:

- **DeviceMessages**: are telemetry messages sent from the users' devices and forwarded by the system.
- **TopologyOperation**: are operations that change the graph or metadata of the graph. For example, adding or deleting an entity, such as a space.
- **SpaceChange**: are changes in a space's computed value as a result of a device telemetry message.
- **SensorChange**: are changes in a sensor's computed value as a result of a device telemetry message.
- **UdfCustom**: are custom notifications from a user-defined function.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all **EndpointTypes** support all **EventTypes**. 

The **EventTypes** allowed for each **EndpointType** are as follows:

|             | DeviceMessages | TopologyOperation | SpaceChange | SensorChange | UdfCustom |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
| **EventHub**|     X          |         X         |     X       |      X       |   X       |
| **ServiceBus**|              |         X         |     X       |      X       |   X       |
| **EventGrid**|               |         X         |     X       |      X       |   X       |
