# Integrate industry-standard models with DTDL for Azure Digital Twins

Using models that are based on industry standards or use standard ontology representation, such as RDF or OWL, provides a rich starting point when designing your Azure Digital Twins models. Using industry models also helps with standardization and information sharing.

To be used with Azure Digital Twins, a model must be represented in the JSON-LD-based [**Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)**](concepts-models.md). Therefore, this article describes how to represent your industry-standard models in DTDL, integrating the existing industry concepts with DTDL semantics so that Azure Digital Twins can use them. The DTDL model then serves as the source of truth for the model within Azure Digital Twins.

There are two main paths to integrating industry-standard models with DTDL, depending on your situation:
* If you have yet to create your models, you can design them around **existing starter DTDL ontologies** that contain language specific to your industry.
* If you already have existing models that are based on an industry standard, you'll need to **convert them to DTDL** in order to bring them into Azure Digital Twins.

You can also always use the ideas from your industry models to develop your own custom DTDL models from scratch, as described in [*How-to: Manage custom models*](how-to-manage-model.md).

## Use a starter DTDL ontology for your industry 

For some industries, there are starter DTDL ontologies (sets of models) available that help provide common ground for industry standards and DTDL requirements to prevent reinvention. You can also extend or contribute to a starter ontology to customize it to your business. 

Here are the starter DTDL ontologies currently available:
* For the real estate industry – the [Smart Building DTDL-based ontology](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building) (created in partnership with the RealEstateCore Consortium). Here you can find models for smart buildings, as well as best practices for how to consume and extend the ontology.

For other domains that do not currently offer starter DTDL ontologies, like smart cities and energy grids, you can follow the best practices outlined in this article to convert industry models and create your own solutions.

## Create and edit models

The first step in modeling is creating your models. You can create and complete editing of your industry-standard models before converting them to DTDL, or you can convert them to DTDL early and continue editing them as DTDL documents.

### With industry standards

Most industry models (also referred to as **ontologies**) are based on semantic web standards such as [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/[), [RDF](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDF), and [RDFS](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDFS). 

In some cases, you may want to create or edit a model using OWL-based model tools. You can use any number of model authoring tools to design an OWL-based model, including the following.
* [WebProtégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#web-protege) and [Protégé Desktop](https://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#desktop-protege) are popular examples. You can import industry models in multiple formats, edit or extend a model, and export the model. 
* [WebVOWL](http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/) is another popular tool for visualizing models. 

If you create a model using some industry standard that is not DTDL, you will then need to convert it to DTDL and upload it to Azure Digital Twins. 

#### Common model file formats 

RDF, OWL, and RDFS are the basic building blocks of the semantic web. 

**RDF** provides a conceptual structure for describing things, in the form of **triples**. Triples consist of three parts: **subject**, **predicate**, and **object**. Objects can be made of URIs. 

Here are some examples of RDF triples:

```
<LogicalDevice> <hasCapabiity> <Temperature>
<Chiller> <locatedIn> <Level1>
<Asset> <isPartOf> <Asset>  
```

These examples are all valid RDF, but the last statement is semantically invalid. This situation is where the OWL specification enters the picture. **OWL** defines what you can write with RDF in order to have valid ontology.

Here is an example making use of OWL: 

```
<Asset> <isPartOf> <Building>
<TemperatureSensor> <isType> <Sensor>
```

**RDFS** provides additional vocabulary semantics that help you define and describe classes. For example, one such class is `rdfs:subClassOf`:

```
<Equipment> <subClassOf> <Asset>
```

Models can be saved, imported, and exported in many file formats, including:  
* RDF/XML 
* Turtle (TTL) 
* OWL/XML 

### With DTDL

Azure Digital Twins uses the JSON-LD-based **Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL)** for modeling. Any model that will be used with Azure Digital Twins will need to be either originally written in or converted into DTDL.

When working with models in DTDL, you can use the [**DTDL extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-dtdl) available for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which provides syntax validation and other features to facilitate writing DTDL models.

You can read more about Azure Digital Twins models and their components in [*Concepts: Custom models*](concepts-models.md) and [*How-to: Manage custom models*](how-to-manage-model.md).

## Convert industry-standard models to DTDL

To use a model with Azure Digital Twins, it must be in DTDL format. This section describes a pattern for converting convert RDF-based models to DTDL so that they can be used with Azure Digital Twins, including...
* **Strategy-level guidance** that can be applied to a variety of standards and model types
* [**Sample code** for an RDF-specific converter](#sample-converter-application)

### Conversion pattern

There are several third-party libraries that can be used when converting RDF-based models to DTDL. Some of these libraries allow you to load your model file into a graph. You can loop through the graph looking for specific RDFS and OWL constructs, and convert these to DTDL.   

The following table is an example of how RDFS and OWL constructs can be mapped to DTDL. 

| RDFS/OWL concept | RDFS/OWL construct | DTDL concept | DTDL construct |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Classes | `owl:Class`<br>IRI suffix<br>``rdfs:label``<br>``rdfs:comment`` | Interface | `@type:Interface`<br>`@id`<br>`displayName`<br>`comment` 
| Subclasses | `owl:Class`<br>IRI suffix<br>`rdfs:label`<br>`rdfs:comment`<br>`rdfs:subClassOf` | Interface | `@type:Interface`<br>`@id`<br>`displayName`<br>`comment`<br>`extends` 
| Datatype Properties | `owl:DatatypeProperty`<br>`rdfs:label` or `INode`<br>`rdfs:label`<br>`rdfs:range` | Interface Properties | `@type:Property`<br>`name`<br>`displayName`<br>`schema` 
| Object Properties | `owl:ObjectProperty`<br>`rdfs:label` or `INode`<br>`rdfs:range`<br>`rdfs:comment`<br>`rdfs:label` | Relationship | `type:Relationship`<br>`name`<br>`target` (or omitted if no `rdfs:range`)<br>`comment`<br>`displayName`<br>

The following C# code snippet shows how an RDF model file is loaded into a graph and converted to DTDL, using the [**dotNetRDF**](https://www.dotnetrdf.org/) library. 

```csharp
using VDS.RDF.Ontology; 
using VDS.RDF.Parsing; 
using Microsoft.Azure.DigitalTwins.Parser; 

//...

Console.WriteLine("Reading file..."); 

FileLoader.Load(_ontologyGraph, rdfFile.FullName); 

// Start looping through for each owl:Class 
foreach (OntologyClass owlClass in _ontologyGraph.OwlClasses) 
{ 

    // Generate a DTMI for the owl:Class 
    string Id = GenerateDTMI(owlClass); 

    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Id)) 
    { 

        Console.WriteLine($"{owlClass.ToString()} -> {Id}"); 

        // Create Interface
        DtdlInterface dtdlInterface = new DtdlInterface 
        { 
            Id = Id, 
            Type = "Interface", 
            DisplayName = GetInterfaceDisplayName(owlClass), 
            Comment = GetInterfaceComment(owlClass), 
            Contents = new List<DtdlContents>() 
        }; 

        // Use DTDL 'extends' for super classes 
        IEnumerable<OntologyClass> foundSuperClasses = owlClass.DirectSuperClasses; 

        //... 
     }

     // Add interface to the list of interfaces 
     _interfaceList.Add(dtdlInterface); 
} 

// Serialize to JSON 
var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(_interfaceList); 

//...
``` 

### Sample converter application 

There is a sample application available that converts an RDF-based model file to [DTDL (version 2)](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) for use by the Azure Digital Twins service. The sample is a .NET Core command-line application called **RdfToDtdlConverter**.

You can get the sample here: [**RdfToDtdlConverter**](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/rdftodtdlconverter/digital-twins-model-conversion-samples/). 

To download the code to your machine, hit the *Download ZIP* button underneath the title on the sample landing page. This will download a *ZIP* file under the name *RdfToDtdlConverter_sample_application_to_convert_RDF_to_DTDL.zip*, which you can then unzip and explore.

You can use this sample to see the conversion patterns in context, and to have as a building block for your own applications performing model conversions according to your own specific needs.

## Validate and upload DTDL models

[!INCLUDE [Azure Digital Twins: validate models info](../../includes/digital-twins-validate.md)]

Once a model is converted and validated, you can **upload it to your Azure Digital Twins instance**. For more information on this process, see the [*Upload models*](how-to-manage-model.md#upload-models) section of *How-to: Manage custom models*.
