# Manage a graph of digital twins using relationships

The heart of Azure Digital Twins is the [twin graph](concepts-twins-graph.md) representing your whole environment. The twin graph is made  of individual digital twins connected via **relationships**.

Once you have a working [Azure Digital Twins instance](how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md) and have set up [authentication](how-to-authenticate-client.md) code in your client app, you can use the [**DigitalTwins APIs**](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md) to create, modify, and delete digital twins and their relationships in an Azure Digital Twins instance. You can also use the [.NET (C#) SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/digitaltwins/Azure.DigitalTwins.Core), or the [Azure Digital Twins CLI](how-to-use-cli.md).

This article focuses on managing relationships and the graph as a whole; to work with individual digital twins, see [*How-to: Manage digital twins*](how-to-manage-twin.md).

## Create relationships

Relationships describe how different digital twins are connected to each other, which forms the basis of the twin graph.

Relationships are created using the `CreateRelationship` call. 

To create a relationship, you need to specify:
* The source twin ID (_srcId_) (the twin where the relationship originates)
* The target twin ID (_targetId_) (the twin where the relationship arrives)
* A relationship name (_relName_)
* A relationship ID (_relId_)

The relationship ID must be unique within the given source twin. It doesn't need to be globally unique.
For example, for the twin *foo*, each specific relationship ID must be unique. However, another twin *bar* can have an outgoing relationship that matches the same ID of a *foo* relationship.

The following code sample illustrates how to create a relationship to your Azure Digital Twins instance.

```csharp
public async static Task CreateRelationship(DigitalTwinsClient client, string srcId, string targetId, string relName)
        {
            var relationship = new BasicRelationship
            {
                TargetId = targetId,
                Name = relName
            };

            try
            {
                string relId = $"{srcId}-{relName}->{targetId}";
                await client.CreateRelationshipAsync(srcId, relId, JsonSerializer.Serialize(relationship));
                Console.WriteLine($"Created {relName} relationship successfully");
            }
            catch (RequestFailedException rex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Create relationship error: {rex.Status}:{rex.Message}");
            }
            
        }
```
In your main method, you can now call CreateRelationship() function with _contains_ relationship like this: 

`await CreateRelationship(client, srcId, targetId, "contains");`

If you wish to create multiple relationships, you can repeat calls to the same method, passing different relationship types into the argument. 

`await CreateRelationship(client, srcId, targetId, "<relationship-type>");`

For more information on the helper class `BasicRelationship`, see [*How-to: Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs*](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md).

### Create multiple relationships between twins

Relationships can be classified as
1. OutgoingRelationships - GetRelationshipsAsync() method is used to get outgoing relationships of a twin.
2. IncomingRelationships - GetIncomingRelationshipsAsync() method is used to get incoming relationships of a twin.

There is no restriction on the number of relationships that you can have between two twins—you can have as many relationships between twins as you like. 

This means that you can express several different types of relationships between two twins at once. For example, *Twin A* can have both a *stored* relationship and *manufactured* relationship with *Twin B*.

You can even create multiple instances of the same type of relationship between the same two twins, if desired. In this example, *Twin A* could have two different *stored* relationships with *Twin B* differed by relationship ID.

## List relationships

To access the list of **outgoing** relationships for a given twin in the graph, you can use GetRelationships() method like this:

`await client.GetRelationships()`

This returns an `Azure.Pageable<T>` or `Azure.AsyncPageable<T>`, depending on the synchronous or asynchronous version of the call.

Here is an example that retrieves a list of relationships:

```csharp
public static async Task<List<BasicRelationship>> FindOutgoingRelationshipsAsync(DigitalTwinsClient client, string dtId)
        {
            // Find the relationships for the twin
            try
            {
                // GetRelationshipsAsync will throw if an error occurs
                AsyncPageable<string> relsJson = client.GetRelationshipsAsync(dtId);
                List<BasicRelationship> results = new List<BasicRelationship>();
                await foreach (string relJson in relsJson)
                {
                    var rel = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<BasicRelationship>(relJson);
                    results.Add(rel);
                    Console.WriteLine(relJson);
                }

                return results;
            }
            catch (RequestFailedException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"*** Error {ex.Status}/{ex.ErrorCode} retrieving relationships for {dtId} due to {ex.Message}");
                return null;
            }
        }

```

You can now call this method to see the outgoing relationships of the twins like this:

`await FindOutgoingRelationshipsAsync(client, twin_id);`

You can use the retrieved relationships to navigate to other twins in your graph. To do this, read the `target` field from the relationship that is returned, and use it as the ID for your next call to `GetDigitalTwin`.

### Find incoming relationships to a digital twin

Azure Digital Twins also has an API to find all **incoming** relationships to a given twin. This is often useful for reverse navigation, or when deleting a twin.

The previous code sample focused on finding outgoing relationships from a twin. The following example is structured similarly, but finds *incoming* relationships to the twin instead.

Note that the `IncomingRelationship` calls don't return the full body of the relationship.

```csharp
public static async Task<List<IncomingRelationship>> FindIncomingRelationshipsAsync(DigitalTwinsClient client, string dtId)
        {
            // Find the relationships for the twin
            try
            {
                // GetRelationshipsAsync will throw an error if a problem occurs
                AsyncPageable<IncomingRelationship> incomingRels = client.GetIncomingRelationshipsAsync(dtId);

                List<IncomingRelationship> results = new List<IncomingRelationship>();
                await foreach (IncomingRelationship incomingRel in incomingRels)
                {
                    results.Add(incomingRel);
                    Console.WriteLine(incomingRel);

                }
                return results;
            }
            catch (RequestFailedException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"*** Error {ex.Status}/{ex.ErrorCode} retrieving incoming relationships for {dtId} due to {ex.Message}");
                return null;
            }
        }
```

You can now call this method to see the incoming relationships of the twins like this:

`await FindIncomingRelationshipsAsync(client, twin_id);`

You can fetch and print the properties of twins with their relationships using `FetchAndPrintTwinAsync()` method.

```csharp  
private static async Task FetchAndPrintTwinAsync(DigitalTwinsClient client, string twin_id)
        {
            BasicDigitalTwin twin;
            Response<string> res = client.GetDigitalTwin(twin_id);
            twin = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<BasicDigitalTwin>(res.Value);
            
            await FindOutgoingRelationshipsAsync(client, twin_id);
            await FindIncomingRelationshipsAsync(client, twin_id);

            return;
        }
```

You can now call this function in your main method like this: 

`await FetchAndPrintTwinAsync(client, targetId);`

## Create a twin graph 

The following runnable code snippet uses the relationship operations from this article to create a twin graph out of digital twins and relationships.

> The twin graph is a concept of creating relationships between twins. If you want to view the visual representation of the twin graph, you can checkout [visualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-manage-graph#visualization) section of this article. 

## Delete relationships

You can delete relationships using DeleteRelationshipAsync(srcId, relId) method.

`await DeleteRelationship(client, srcId, $"{targetId}-contains->{srcId}");` in your main method.

The first parameter specifies the source twin (the twin where the relationship originates). The other parameter is the relationship ID. You need both the twin ID and the relationship ID, because relationship IDs are only unique within the scope of a twin.

```csharp
private static async Task DeleteRelationship(DigitalTwinsClient client, string srcId, string relId)
        {
            try
            {
                Response response = await client.DeleteRelationshipAsync(srcId, relId);
                await FetchAndPrintTwinAsync(srcId, client);
                Console.WriteLine("Deleted relationship successfully");
            }
            catch (RequestFailedException Ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error {Ex.ErrorCode}");
            }
        }
```

### Create a twin graph from a spreadsheet

In practical use cases, twin hierarchies will often be created from data stored in a different database, or perhaps in a spreadsheet. This section illustrates how a spreadsheet can be parsed.

Consider the following data table, describing a set of digital twins and relationships to be created.

| ModelID| ID (must be unique) | Relationship (From) | Relationship Name | Init Data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dtmi:example:Floor;1 | Floor1 |  | 
| dtmi:example:Floor;1 | Floor0 |  |  
| dtmi:example:Room;1  | Room1 | Floor1 | contains | {"Temperature": 80, "Humidity": 60} |
| dtmi:example:Room;1  | Room0 | Floor0 | contains | {"Temperature": 70, "Humidity": 30} |


The following code uses the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview) to read a spreadsheet and construct an Azure Digital Twins twin graph from the results.

```csharp
var range = msftGraphClient.Me.Drive.Items["BuildingsWorkbook"].Workbook.Worksheets["Building"].usedRange;
JsonDocument data = JsonDocument.Parse(range.values);
List<BasicRelationship> RelationshipRecordList = new List<BasicRelationship>();
foreach (JsonElement row in data.RootElement.EnumerateArray())
{
    string type = row[0].GetString();
    string id = row[1].GetString();
    string relSource = row[2].GetString();
    string relName = row[3].GetString();
    // Parse spreadsheet extra data into a JSON string to initialize the digital twin
    // Left out for compactness
    Dictionary<string, object> initData = new Dictionary<string, object>() { ... };

    if (relSource != null)
    {
        BasicRelationship br = new BasicRelationship()
        {
            SourceId = relSource,
            TargetId = id,
            Name = relName
        };
        RelationshipRecordList.Add(br);
    }

    BasicDigitalTwin twin = new BasicDigitalTwin();
    twin.CustomProperties = initData;
    // Set the type of twin to be created
    switch (type)
    {
        case "room":
            twin.Metadata = new DigitalTwinMetadata() { ModelId = "dtmi:com:contoso:Room;2" };
            break;
        case "floor":
            twin.Metadata = new DigitalTwinMetadata() { ModelId = "dtmi:com:contoso:Floor;2" };
            break;
        ... handle additional types
    }
    try
    {
        client.CreateDigitalTwin(id, JsonSerializer.Serialize<BasicDigitalTwin>(twin));
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
       Console.WriteLine($"Error {e.Status}: {e.Message}");
    }
    foreach (BasicRelationship rec in RelationshipRecordList)
    { 
        try { 
            client.CreateRelationship(rec.SourceId, Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), JsonSerializer.Serialize<BasicRelationship>(rec));
        }
        catch (RequestFailedException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error {e.Status}: {e.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```
## Manage relationships with CLI

Twins and their relationships can also be managed using the Azure Digital Twins CLI. The commands can be found in [*How-to: Use the Azure Digital Twins CLI*](how-to-use-cli.md).
