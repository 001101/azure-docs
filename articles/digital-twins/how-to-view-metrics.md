# View and understand Azure Digital Twins metrics

These metrics give you information about the state of Azure Digital Twins resources in your Azure subscription. Azure Digital Twins metrics help you assess the overall health of Azure Digital Twins service and the resources connected to it. These user-facing statistics help you see what is going on with your Azure Digital Twins and help perform root-cause analysis on issues without needing to contact Azure support.

Metrics are enabled by default. You can view Azure Digital Twins metrics from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
