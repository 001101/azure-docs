> [!NOTE]
> You may choose to use low-priority VMs to run some or all of your workloads. These VMs do not have guaranteed availability and may be preempted while in use. A preempted job is restarted, not resumed.  Low-priority VMs have discounted rates compared to normal VMs, see [Plan and manage costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-plan-manage-cost). See how to [create a low-priority VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-set-up-training-targets#low-pri-vm).
