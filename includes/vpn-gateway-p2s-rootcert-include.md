You can use either a root certificate that was generated using an enterprise solution (recommended), or you can generate a self-signed certificate. After creating the root certificate, you export the public certificate data (not the private key) as a Base-64 encoded X.509 .cer file and upload the public certificate data to Azure.

* **Enterprise certificate:** If you are using an enterprise solution, you can use your existing certificate chain. Obtain the .cer file for the root certificate that you want to use.
* **Self-signed root certificate:** If you are not using an enterprise certificate solution, you need to create a self-signed root certificate. It's important that you follow the steps in one of the P2S certificate articles below. Otherwise, the certificates you create won't be compatible with P2S connections and you will receive a connection error. The steps in either of the following articles will generate a compatible certificate:

  * [Windows 10 PowerShell instructions](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md): These instructions require Windows 10 to generate certificates, however, the client certificates that you generate from this root certificate can be installed on any supported P2S client.
  * [MakeCert instructions](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site-makecert.md): MakeCert is deprecated, but doesn't require Windows 10 PowerShell to generate certificate. You can still use it to generate certificates.
