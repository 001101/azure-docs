## Configure the Spatial Anchors endpoint and account key

In the **Project** pane, navigate to `Assets/AzureSpatialAnchorsPlugin/Examples` and open the `AzureSpatialAnchorsBasicDemo.unity` scene file.

In the **Hierarchy** pane, select the **AzureSpatialAnchors** game object. Then, in the **Inspector** pane, enter the `Account Key` (from the Spatial Anchors resource created earlier) as the value for `Spatial Anchors Account Key` and the `Endpoint` url (from the Spatial Anchors resource created earlier) as the value for `Spatial Anchors Endpoint`.

Save the scene either by selecting **File** -> **Save Scene**.
