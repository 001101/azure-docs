You can access Azure Cognitive Services through two different resources: A multi-service resource, or a single-service one.

* Multi-service resource:
    * Use a single key for most Azure Cognitive Services.
* Single-service resource:
    * Enables access to a specified cognitive service. 
    * Use the free tier to try out the service.
