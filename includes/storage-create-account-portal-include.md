To create a general-purpose v2 storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **All services**. In the list of resources, type **Storage Accounts**. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. Select **Storage Accounts**.
1. On the **Storage Accounts** window that appears, choose **Add**.
1. On the **Basics** tab, select the subscription in which to create the storage account.
1. Under the **Resource group** field, select your desired resource group, or create a new resource group.
1. Next, enter a name for your storage account. The name you choose must be unique across Azure. The name also must be between 3 and 24 characters in length, and may include only numbers and lowercase letters.
1. Select a location for your storage account, or use the default location.
1. Select a performance tier. The default tier is *Standard*.
1. Set the **Account kind** field to *Storage V2 (general-purpose v2)*.
1. Specify how the storage account will be replicated. The default replication option is *Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)*.
1. Specify the access tier for blobs in the storage account. The default tier is *hot*.
1. To use [Azure Data Lake Storage](/services/storage/data-lake-storage/), choose the **Advanced** tab, and then set **Hierarchical namespace** to **Enabled**.
1. Select **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings and create the account.
1. Select **Create**.
