The following table describes default limits for Azure Storage. The *ingress* limit refers to all data (requests) being sent to a storage account. The *egress* limit refers to all data (responses) being received from a storage account.

| Resource | Default Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Number of storage accounts per region per subscription, including both standard and premium accounts | 200 |
| Max storage account capacity<sup>1</sup> | 2 PB for US and Europe, 500 TB for all other regions including UK |
| Max number of blob containers, blobs, file shares, tables, queues, entities, or messages per storage account | No limit |
| Maximum request rate<sup>1</sup> per storage account | 20,000 requests per second |
| Max ingress<sup>1</sup> for general-purpose v2 and Blob storage accounts (US and Europe regions, except UK regions) | 25 Gbps |
| Max ingress<sup>1</sup> for general-purpose v1 storage accounts (all regions including UK and except US and Europe) | 5 Gbps if RA-GRS/GRS enabled, 10 Gbps for LRS/ZRS<sup>2</sup> |
| Max egress<sup>1</sup> for general-purpose v2 and Blob storage accounts (all regions) | 50 Gbps |
| Max egress<sup>1</sup> for general-purpose v1 storage accounts (US regions) | 20 Gbps if RA-GRS/GRS enabled, 30 Gbps for LRS/ZRS <sup>2</sup> |
| Max egress<sup>1</sup> for general-purpose v1 storage accounts (Non-US regions) | 10 Gbps if RA-GRS/GRS enabled, 15 Gbps for LRS/ZRS <sup>2</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> Azure storage accounts support higher limits for capacity, request rate, ingress, and egress by request. For more information about the increased limits, see [Announcing larger, higher scale storage accounts](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-larger-higher-scale-storage-accounts/). To request an increase in account limits, contact [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/).

<sup>2</sup>[Azure Storage replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy) options include:
* **RA-GRS**: Read-access geo-redundant storage. If RA-GRS is enabled, egress targets for the secondary location are identical to those for the primary location.
* **GRS**: Geo-redundant storage. 
* **ZRS**: Zone-redundant storage.
* **LRS**: Locally redundant storage. 

If the needs of your application exceed the scalability targets of a single storage account, you can build your application to use multiple storage accounts. You can then partition your data objects across those storage accounts. See [Azure Storage Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/) for information on volume pricing.

All storage accounts run on a flat network topology and support the scalability and performance targets outlined in this article, regardless of when they were created. For more information on the Azure Storage flat network architecture and on scalability, see [Microsoft Azure Storage: A Highly Available Cloud Storage Service with Strong Consistency](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/11/20/windows-azure-storage-a-highly-available-cloud-storage-service-with-strong-consistency.aspx).
