1. [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](setup-create-workspace.md#portal) if you don't have one.

1. Open your workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  If you're not sure how to locate your workspace in the portal, see [how to find your workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md#view).

1. In your workspace, click on some section whose name I do not yet know.  Then click on some button whose name I also do not know.  This will open up some page whose title I do not know.  When I do know these things they will be added here, along with a screenshot.
