When an IoT Hub fails, the last error that caused the service problem is stored and can be retrieved . This table is the most likely errors that can happen. Please refer to this table for troubleshooting errors with your Iot hub.

|Last Known Error|Description/when it occurs|Mitigation/next steps|Comments|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
Transient=1|A transient error has occurred and IoTHub will retry the operation.|Check diagnostic logs for more relevant information about the error?| |
|InternalError=2|An error occurred while delivering a message to an endpoint|Check diagnostic logs for more relevant information about the error?||
|Unauthorized=3|IoTHub is not authorized to send messages to the specified endpoint.|Validate the connection string is up to date for the endpoint. If it has changed, consider updating your hub. For endpoints that use managed identity (GA in May--is it going to, do we need this, what's the deal?). Check that IoTHub principal has required permissions on the target resource.||
|Throttled=4|IoTHub is being throttled while writing messages into the endpoint.|Consider reviewing the throttling limits for the affected endpoint. <br><br>Increase the limit (is this possible), or consider reducing the load of messages sent to this endpoint.||
|Timeout=5|Operation timeout. Please retry.| Timeouts are usually retriable operations. Any other idea apart from retrying?||
|NullMessage=6|This happens when a non-nullable parameter is set to null.|Review content of the message to ensure all required fields are present.|This exception only happens for EventGrid. Do we want to document this? I don't feel customers will hit this scenario.|
|Slow=7|  |  |Like what are we using to describe a slow endpoint? I think we should not add this one, we don't show this to customers.|
|InvalidData=8|This error happens when sending invalid data (like invalid characters) to an event grid endpoint.|Validate data is correct.|We only expose this error code using Event Grid, and EG is not shown as an endpoint to the customer, so we should not include it.|
|**Service Bus**||||
|MaxMessageSize<br>Exceeded|Message routing has a message size limit of 256Kb. The message size being routed exceeded this limit.|See if fewer application properties or message enrichments can be used.||
|**Topics**||||
|PartitioningAndDuplicate<br>DetectionNotSupported=40|Service bus must not have duplicate detection enabled|Disable duplicate detection from service bus or consider using an entity without duplicate detection||
|SessionfulEntityNotSupported=41|Service bus must not have sessions enabled|Disable session from service bus or consider using an entity without sessions||
|NoMatchingSubscriptions<br>ForMessage=42|There is not subscription to write message on the service bus topic|Create a subscription for IoTHub messages to be sent||
|EndpointExternallyDisabled=43|Endpoint is not on active state so IoTHub can send messages to it|Wait for endpoint to be in Active state or troubleshoot the endpoint to become active.||
|DeviceMaximumQueueDepth<br>
Exceeded=44|Service bus size limit has been reached|Consider removing messages from the target event hub to allow new messages to be ingested into the event hub||
