## Deploy a licensed image

For many commonly used Marketplace images, you only need to supply the image publisher, offer, SKU, and version parameters to identify a Marketplace image through programmatic tools. However, certain VM images in the Azure Marketplace have license terms that you must accept before you can deploy them programmatically using Azure command-line tools, Resource Manager templates, or APIs.  

If you need to accept license terms for an image, you also need to provide *purchase plan* parameters for the image.

The following sections explain how to find out if an image has license terms you must accept, and how to find the purchase plan information.
