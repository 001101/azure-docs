In order to receive a LUIS prediction in a chat bot or other _client application_, you need to publish the app to the endpoint. 

You do not have to create a LUIS endpoint key in the Azure portal before you publish or before you test the endpoint URL. Every LUIS app has a free starter key for authoring. This key gives you unlimited authoring and a [few endpoint hits](../articles/cognitive-services/luis/luis-boundaries.md#key-limits). 

1. Select **Publish** in the top right navigation.

2. Select the Production slot and the **Publish** button.

3. Publishing is complete when you see the green status bar at the top of the website confirming success.

4. Select the link in the green status bar to go to the **Keys and endpoints** page to see the endpoint URLs. The endpoint URLs are listed at the bottom of the page.
