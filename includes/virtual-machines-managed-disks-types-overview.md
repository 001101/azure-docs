# Disk types

Azure managed disks currently offers four disk types, three of which are generally available and one that is currently in preview. These four disk types each have their own appropriate target customer scenarios, they are as follows:

|Disk Type  |Scenario  |
|---------|---------|
|Ultra SSD (Preview)     |IO-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databases (for example, SQL, Oracle), and other transaction-heavy workloads.         |
|Premium SSD     |Production and performance sensitive workloads         |
|Standard SSD     |Web servers, lightly used enterprise applications and Dev/Test         |
|Standard HDD     |Backup, Non-critical, Infrequent access         |

## Disk comparison

The following table provides a comparison of Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, and Ultra SSD for managed disks to help you decide what to use.

## Ultra SSD (Preview)

Azure Ultra SSD (preview) delivers high throughput, high IOPS, and consistent low latency disk storage for Azure IaaS VMs. This new offering provides top of the line performance at the same availability levels as our existing disks offerings. Sine additional benefits of Ultra SSD include the ability to dynamically change the performance of the disk, along with your workloads, without the need to restart your virtual machines. Ultra SSD is suited for data-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databases, and transaction-heavy workloads.

### Performance

When you provision an Ultra SSD, you have the option to independently configure the capacity and the performance of the disk. Ultra SSDs come in several fixed sizes, ranging from 4 GiB up to 64 TiB, and feature a flexible performance configuration model that allows you to independently configure IOPS and throughput. Ultra SSDs can only be used as data disks. We recommend using Premium SSDs as OS disks.

Some key capabilities of Ultra SSD are:

- Disk Capacity: Ultra SSD capacity ranges from 4 GiB up to 64 TiB.
- Disk IOPS: Ultra SSDs support IOPS limits of 300 IOPS/GiB, up to a maximum of 160 K IOPS per disk. To achieve the IOPS that you provisioned, ensure that the selected Disk IOPS are less than the VM IOPS. The minimum disk IOPS are 100 IOPS.
- Disk Throughput: With Ultra SSDs, the throughput limit of a single disk is 256 KiB/s for each provisioned IOPS, up to a maximum of 2000 MBps per disk (where MBps = 10^6 Bytes per second). The minimum disk throughput is 1 MiB.

### Disk size

|Disk Size (GiB)  |IOPS Caps  |Throughput Cap (MBps)  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|4     |1,200         |300         |
|8     |2,400         |600         |
|16     |4,800         |1,200         |
|32     |9,600         |2,000         |
|64     |19,200         |2,000         |
|128     |38,400         |2,000         |
|256     |76,800         |2,000         |
|512     |80,000         |2,000         |
|1,024-65,536 (sizes in this range increasing in increments of 1 TiB)     |160,000         |2,000         |

### Ultra SSD Preview Scope and Limitations

During preview, Ultra SSD Disks:

- Will be initially supported in East US 2 in a single Availability Zone  
- Can only be used with Availability Zones (Availability Sets and Single VM deployments outside of Zones will not have the ability to attach an Ultra SSD Disk)
- Are only supported on ES/DS v3 VMs
- Are only available as data disks and only support 4k physical sector size  
- Can only be created as Empty disks  
- Currently can only be deployed using Resource Manager templates, CLI, and Python SDK.
- Does not (yet) support disk snapshots, VM Images, Availability Sets, Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Azure Disk Encryption.
- Does not (yet) support integration with Azure Backup or Azure Site Recovery.
- As with [most previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), this feature should not be used for production workloads until General Availability (GA).

## Premium SSD

Azure Premium SSDs deliver high-performance and low-latency disk support for virtual machines (VMs) with input/output (I/O)-intensive workloads. To take advantage of the speed and performance of premium storage disks, you can migrate existing VM disks to Premium SSDs. Premium SSDs are suitable for mission-critical production applications.

## Standard SSD

Azure Standard Solid State Drives (SSD) managed disks are a cost-effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels. Standard SSD offers a good entry level experience for those who wish to move to the cloud, especially if you experience issues with the variance of workloads running on your HDD solutions on premises. Standard SSDs deliver better availability, consistency, reliability, and latency compared to HDD Disks. Standard SSDs are suitable for Web servers, low IOPS application servers, lightly used enterprise applications, and Dev/Test workloads.

## Standard HDD

Azure Standard Storage delivers reliable, low-cost disk support for VMs running latency-insensitive workloads. It also supports blobs, tables, queues, and files. With Standard Storage, the data is stored on hard disk drives (HDDs). When working with VMs, you can use standard SSD and HDD disks for Dev/Test scenarios and less critical workloads. Standard Storage is available in all Azure regions.

## Billing

When using managed disks, the following billing considerations apply:

- Disk Type
- managed disk Size
- Snapshots
- Outbound data transfers
- Number of Transactions

**managed disk Size**: managed disks are billed on the provisioned size. Azure maps the provisioned size (rounded up) to the nearest offered disk size. For details of the disk sizes offered, see the tables above. Each disk maps to a supported provisioned disk size offering and is billed accordingly. For example, if you provisioned a 200 GiB Standard SSD, it maps to the disk size offer of E15 (256 GiB). Billing for any provisioned disk is prorated hourly by using the monthly price for the Premium Storage offer. For example, if you provisioned an E10 disk and deleted it after 20 hours, you're billed for the E10 offering prorated to 20 hours. This is regardless of the amount of actual data written to the disk.

**Snapshots**: Snapshots are billed based on the size used. For example, if you create a snapshot of a managed disk with provisioned capacity of 64 GiB and actual used data size of 10 GiB, the snapshot is billed only for the used data size of 10 GiB.
