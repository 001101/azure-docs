This quickstart uses a pre-created Azure key vault. You can create a key vault by following the steps in the [Azure CLI quickstart](quick-create-cli.md), [Azure PowerShell quickstart](quick-create-powershell.md), or [Azure portal quickstart](quick-create-portal.md). Alternatively, you can simply run the Azure CLI commands below.

> [!Important]
> Each key vault must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-keyvault-name> with the name of your key vault in the following examples.

```azurecli
az group create --name "myResourceGroup" -l "EastUS"

az keyvault create --name <your-unique-keyvault-name> -g "myResourceGroup"
```

```azurepowershell
New-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location EastUS

New-AzKeyVault -Name <your-unique-keyvault-name> -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location EastUS
