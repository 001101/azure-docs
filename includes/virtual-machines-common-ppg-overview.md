Placing VMs in a single region reduces the physical distance between the instances. Placing them within a single availability zones is another step to bringing them physically closer together. However, as the Azure footprint grows, a single availability zone may span multiple physical data centers, which may result in a network latency impacting your application. 

To get VMs as close as possible, achieving the lowest possible latency, you should deploy them within a proximity placement group.

A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure that Azure compute resources are physically located close to each other. Proximity placement groups are useful for workloads where low latency is a requirement.


- Low latency between stand-alone VMs.
- Low Latency between VMs in a single availability set or a virtual machine scale set. 
- Low latency between stand-alone VMs, VMs in multiple Availability Sets, or multiple scale sets. You can have multiple compute resources in a single placement group to bring together a multi-tiered application. 
- Low latency between multiple application tiers using different hardware types. For example, running the backend using M-series in an availability set and the front end on a D-series instance, in a scale set, in a single proximity placement group.



## Best practices 
- Deploy all VM sizes in a single template. In order to avoid landing on hardware that doesn't support all the VM SKUs and sizes you require, make sure to include all application tiers in a single ARM template so that they will all be deployed at the same time..
- If you are scripting your deployment using PowerShell, CLI or the SDK, you may run run into an allocation error of type `OverconstrainedAllocationRequest`. In this case, you should stop/deallocate all the existing VMs, and change the sequence in the deployment script to begin with the VM SKU/sizes that failed. 
- Deploy largest and rarest VM types first. If a VM type is available in a limited number of regions, it is more rare. You can use [this page](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines) to check how many regions support the various sizes.  
- When re-using an existing placement group from which VMs were deleted, wait for the deletion to fully complete before adding VMs to it.
- Put VMs in a proximity placement group and the entire solution in an availability zone.
