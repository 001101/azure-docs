You can use queries in Data Explorer to retrieve and filter your data.

1. At the left of the **Documents** tab in Data Explorer, note that the query is set to `SELECT * FROM c`. This default query retrieves and displays all documents in the collection in ID order. 

    ![Default query in Data Explorer is `SELECT * FROM c`](./media/cosmos-db-create-sql-api-query-data/azure-cosmosdb-data-explorer-query.png)

2. On the **Documents** tab, select the **Edit Filter** button, replace the default query with `ORDER BY c._ts DESC`, and then select **Apply Filter**.

    ![Change the default query by adding ORDER BY c._ts DESC and clicking Apply Filter](./media/cosmos-db-create-sql-api-query-data/azure-cosmosdb-data-explorer-edit-query.png)

This modified query lists the documents in descending order based on their time stamp, so now your second document is listed first. If you're familiar with SQL syntax, you can enter any supported [SQL queries](../articles/cosmos-db/sql-api-sql-query.md) in the query predicate box. 

You can also use Data Explorer to create stored procedures, UDFs, and triggers for server-side business logic. Data Explorer exposes all of the built-in programmatic data access available in the APIs while providing easy access through the Azure portal. You can also use the portal to scale throughput and [review metrics and SLAs](../articles/cosmos-db/create-sql-api-dotnet.md#review-account-metrics-and-slas).
