Once you set up an Azure Digital Twins instance, it is common to interact with that instance through a client application that you create. In order to do this, you'll need to make sure the client app will be able to authenticate against Azure Digital Twins. This is done by setting up an [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) **app registration** for your client app to use.

This app registration is where you configure access permissions to the [Azure Digital Twins APIs](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md). Later, the client app will authenticate against the app registration, and as a result be granted the configured access permissions to the APIs.

>[!TIP]
> As a subscription Owner, you may prefer to set up a new app registration for every new Azure Digital Twins instance, *or* to do this only once and establish a single app registration that will be shared among all Azure Digital Twins instances in the subscription. This is how it's done within Microsoft's own tenant.
