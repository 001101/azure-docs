# Tutorial: Send push notifications to Xamarin.Forms apps using Azure Notification Hubs via a backend service

In this tutorial, you use [Azure Notification Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-overview) to push notifications to a [Xamarin.Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms) application targeting **Android** and **iOS**.  

[!INCLUDE [Notification Hubs Backend Service Introduction](../../includes/notification-hubs-backend-service-introduction.md)]

This tutorial takes you through the following steps:

> * [Set up Push Notification Services and Azure Notification Hubs.](#set-up-push-notification-services-and-azure-notification-hub)
> * [Create an ASP.NET Web API backend application.](#create-an-asp.net-web-api-backend-application)

> * [Test the solution.](#test-the-solution)

## Prerequisites

To follow along you will need:

* An [Azure subscription](https://portal.azure.com) where you can create and manage resources.
* A Mac with [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) installed (or a PC running [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs) with the **Mobile Development with .NET** workload).
* The ability to run the app on either **Android** (physical or emulator devices) or **iOS** (physical devices only).

For Android, you must have:

* A developer unlocked physical device or an emulator *(running API 26 and above with Google Play Services installed)*.

For iOS, you must have:

* An active [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com).
* A physical iOS device that is [registered to your developer account](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev40df0d9fa) *(running iOS 13.0 and above)*.
* A **.p12** [development certificate](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev04fd06d56) installed in your **keychain** allowing you to [run an app on a physical device](#https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev5a825a1ca).

> [!NOTE]
> The iOS Simulator does not support remote notifications and so a physical device is required when exploring this sample on iOS. However, you do not need to run the app on both **Android** and **iOS** in order to complete this tutorial.

Even if you have no prior experience with [building mobile apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-mobile-apps-with-xamarin-forms/) and [creating a Web API with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio), you should be able to follow along the steps for creating this first-principles example. However, you'll benefit from familiarity with the following:

* [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com)
* [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-3.1)
* [Google Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com) and [Azure Notification Hubs](notification-hubs-ios-apple-push-notification-apns-get-started.md).
* [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) and [Xamarin.Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms).

The steps provided are for [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) but it is also possible to follow along using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs).

## Set up Push Notification Services and Azure Notification Hub

Integrating Azure Notification Hubs with a Xamarin.Forms mobile app is similar to integrating Azure Notification Hubs with a Xamarin native application. You must first set up the underlying platform-specific messaging services, **[Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)** for Android and **[Apple Push Notification Services (APNS)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html)** for iOS, before configuring Notification Hubs to work with them.

[!INCLUDE [Create a Firebase project and enable Firebase Cloud Messaging](../../includes/notification-hubs-common-enable-firebase-cloud-messaging.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Enable Apple Push Notifications](../../includes/notification-hubs-common-enable-apple-push-notifications.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create a notification hub](../../includes/notification-hubs-common-create-a-notification-hub.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Configure your notification hub with APNs information](../../includes/notification-hubs-common-configure-with-apns-information.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Configure your notification hub with FCM information](../../includes/notification-hubs-common-configure-with-fcm-information.md)]

## Create an ASP.NET Core Web API backend application

In this section you will create the [ASP.NET Core Web API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis) backend to handle [device registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-registration-management#what-is-device-registration) and the sending of notifications to the Xamarin.Forms mobile app.

[!INCLUDE [Create an ASP.NET Core Web API backend application](../../notification-hubs-backend-service-web-api.md)]

## Create a cross-platform Xamarin.Forms application

You will build a [Xamarin.Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms) mobile application in this section.

[!INCLUDE [Sample application generic overview](../../includes/notification-hubs-backend-service-sample-app-overview.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create Xamarin.Forms application](../../includes/notification-hubs-backend-service-sample-app-xamarin-forms.md)]

## Configure the native Android project for push notifications

[!INCLUDE [Configure the native Android project](../../includes/notification-hubs-backend-service-configure-xamarin-android.md)]

## Configure the native iOS project for push notifications

[!INCLUDE [Configure the native Android project](../../includes/notification-hubs-backend-service-configure-xamarin-ios.md)]

## Test the solution

You can now test sending notifications via the backend service.

[!INCLUDE [Testing the solution](../../includes/notification-hubs-backend-service-testing.md)]

## Next Steps

You should now have a basic Xamarin.Forms app connected to a notification hub via a backend service and can send and receive notifications. You will likely need to adapt the approach used in this tutorial to fit the needs of your own application and implement robust error handling, retry logic, and logging. [Visual Studio App Center](https://appcenter.ms) can be quickly incorporated into mobile apps providing [analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/analytics) and [diagnostics](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/diagnostics/) to aid in troubleshooting.
