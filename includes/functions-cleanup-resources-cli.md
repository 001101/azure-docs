## Clean up resources

If you continue to the next step, [Add an Azure Storage queue output binding][Connect to an Azure Storage queue], keep all your resources in place as you'll build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources to avoid incurring further costs.

```azurecli
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg
```
