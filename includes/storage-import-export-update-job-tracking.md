After shipping the disks, return to the **Import/Export** page on the Azure portal. If the tracking number is not updated within 2 weeks of creating the job, the job expires. To update the tracking number, perform the following steps.
 
1. Select and click the job.
2. Click **Update job status and tracking info once drives are shipped**. 
3. Select the checkbox against **Mark as shipped**.
4. Provide the **Carrier** and **Tracking number**.
5. Track the job progress on the portal dashboard. For a description of each job state, go to [Viewing your job status](#viewing-your-job-status).
