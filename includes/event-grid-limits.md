The following limits apply to Azure Event Grid **topics** (system,  custom, and partner topics). 

| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Custom topics per Azure subscription | 100 |
| Event subscriptions per topic | 500 |
| Publish rate for a custom topic (ingress) | 5,000 events/sec or 1 MB/sec (whichever is met first) |
| Event size | 1 MB*  |
| Private endpoint connections per topic  | 64 | 
| IP Firewall rules per topic | 16 | 

\* Operations are charged in 64 KB increments though. So, events over 64 KB will incur operations charges as though they were multiple events. For example, an event that is 130 KB would incur operations as though it were three separate events.

The following limits apply to Azure Event Grid **domains**. 

| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Topics per event domain | 100,000 |
| Event subscriptions per topic within a domain | 500 |
| Domain scope event subscriptions | 50 |
| Publish rate for an event domain (ingress) | 5,000 events/sec or 1 MB/sec (whichever is met first) |
| Event Domains per Azure Subscription | 100 |
| Private endpoint connections per domain | 64 | 
| IP Firewall rules per domain | 16 |
