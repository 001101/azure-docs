If you experience any device issues, you can create a support package from the system logs. Microsoft Support uses this package to troubleshoot the issues. Follow these steps to create a support package:

Get-HcsNodeSupportPackage
    The support session stays enabled for 8 hours. To disable the support session anytime, use the `Disable-HcsSupportAccess` cmdlet.
