> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article contains content which requires the Azure classic CLI. This is
> an older version of the Azure CLI that should be used only with the
> Azure classic deployment model.
>
> The classic CLI can be installed side-by-side with the modern Azure CLI,
> but we recommend using the Azure CLI for all new scripts and deployments.
> To install the classic CLI, see [Install the Azure classic CLI](/cli/azure/install-classic-cli)
> and to install the current CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
