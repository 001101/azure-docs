Always use [Azure AD security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups) as the assigned principal in an ACL entry. Resist the opportunity to directly assign individual users or service principals. Using this structure will allow you to add and remove users or service principals without the need to reapply ACLs to an entire directory structure. Instead, you can just add or remove them users and service principals from the appropriate Azure AD security group. 

For example, imagine that you have a directory named **/logs** which holds log data that is generated by your server. You might need to grant permissions for the following activities:

- Grant Azure Data Factory (ADF) the ability to ingest data into that folder. 
- Grant specific users from the service engineering team the ability to upload logs and manage other users to this folder. 
- Give various Databricks clusters the ability to analyze logs. 

To enable these activities, you could create a `LogsWriter` group and a `LogsReader` group. Then, you could assign permissions as follows:

- Add the `LogsWriter` group to the ACL of the **/logs** directory with `rwx` permissions.
- Add the `LogsReader` group to the ACL of the **/logs** directory with `r-x` permissions.
- Add the service principal object or Managed Service Identity (MSI) for ADF to the `LogsWriters` group.
- Add the service engineering team (and any users) to the `LogsWriter` group.
- Add the service principal object or MSI for Databricks to the `LogsReader` group.
