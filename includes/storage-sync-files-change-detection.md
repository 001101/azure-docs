* <a id="afs-change-detection"></a>**I created a file directly in my Azure File share over SMB or through the portal. How long until the file is synced to the servers in the Sync Group?**  
    Changes made to the Azure File share using the Azure portal, SMB, or REST, are not immediately detected and replicated like changes to the Server Endpoint are. This is because Azure Files does not yet have change notifications/journaling, so there is no way to automatically initiate a sync session when files are changed. On Windows Server, Azure File Sync uses [Windows USN journaling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363798.aspx) to automatically initiate a sync session when files change.

    To detect changes to the Azure File share, Azure File Sync has a scheduled job called a "change detection job", which enumerates every file in the file share and compares it to the sync version for that file. When the change detection job determines files have changed, Azure File Sync initiates a sync session. The change detection job is initated every 24 hours. Because the change detection job works by enumerating every file in the Azure File share, very large namespaces will take longer than smaller namespaces. This means that for these namespaces, it may take longer than once every 24 hours to determine which files have changed. 
    
    In the long run, we'll need to add a change detection feature in Azure Files that we can use like how we use USN on Windows Server. Please help us prioritize this feature for a future release by voting for it at the [Azure Files UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/217298-storage/category/180670-files).
