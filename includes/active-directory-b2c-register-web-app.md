Make note of the globally unique **Application Client ID**. You use the ID in your application's code.

If your web application calls a web API secured by Azure AD B2C, perform these steps:
   1. Create an application secret by going to the **Keys** blade and clicking the **Generate Key** button. Make note of the **App key** value. You use the value as the application secret in your application's code.
   2. Click **API Access**, click **Add**, and select your web API and scopes (permissions).

> [!NOTE]
> An **Application Secret** is an important security credential, and should be secured appropriately.
