If your application needs to use [OpenID Connect sign-in](../articles/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-reference-oidc.md), toggle the **Allow implicit flow** toggle to **Yes**.

The **Reply URLs** are endpoints where Azure AD B2C returns any tokens that your application requests. For example, enter `https://contoso.com/b2capp`.
