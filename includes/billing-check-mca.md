2. Search on **Cost Management + Billing**.

3. If you have access to just one billing account, select **Properties** from the left-hand side. You have access to a billing account for a Microsoft customer agreement when the agreement type of the billing account is Microsoft Customer Agreement.

4. If you have access to multiple billing accounts, check the agreement type of the billing account in the list. You have access to a billing account for a Microsoft customer agreement if the agreement type of any of the billing accounts is Microsoft Customer Agreement.
