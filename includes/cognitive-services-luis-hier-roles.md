## Roles versus hierarchical entities

Should you use a hierarchical entity or a pattern with a simple entity with roles? 

That depends. Patterns and example utterances are comparable in that they represent a user's utterance, and are specific to an intent.  

If the utterances donâ€™t have a clear pattern, use hierarchical entities. 

|Hierarchical entities|Simple entity with roles|
|--|--|
|must have example utterances with child entities labeled in intents|must have example utterances, **roles can't be labeled in intents**|
|can use in patterns|**must** use in patterns|
|may need **more** example utterances in intent|may need **fewer** example utterances in intent|
