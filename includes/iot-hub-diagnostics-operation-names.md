<!-- operation names for the diag logs for IoT Hub -->


|Operation Name|Error Code (resultType)|Level|Description|Notes|
|------------- |----------|-----|-----------|--------|
|UndefinedRouteEvaluation |   |Information|We log undefined evaluation when a message cannot be evaluated with a giving condition. Example = a property on the route condition is not present in the message.|  |
|RouteEvaluationError|  |Error|Error evaluating message because of an issue with the message format. For example: content encoding not specified. Content type not valid.|This one has many sub-events in the spec doc. For example: routeEvaluationError-Content encoding not specified. routeEvaluationError-ContentType not valid. When this event is logged, we log the exception information with it, which can provide more information for the customer on why the evaluation failed. Examples: Content encoding is not specified in system properties. Error in $body query. Expecting a tags/desired/reported.|
|DroppedMessage|   |Error|Message dropped by routing as message didn't match any routing query. Message failed to send after several retries because of dead endpoint.|   |
|EndpointDead|   |Error|Endpoint has not been accepting messages from IoT Hub for over am hour.|   |
|EndpointUnhealthy|   |Error|Endpoint has not been accepting messages from IoT Hub and IoT Hub is trying to resend the messages.|This one has many sub-events in the spec doc. For example: <br>Endpointunhealthy-internalServerError<br>endpointUnhealthy-authorization error<br>Failure kind (result description field in diagnostic logs) is displayed in the error message, and it comes from the exception message when delivering messages to **an endpoint fails** *failing endpoint?*. For example, for a service bus that ran out of space I got this repro: <br>{ "time": "2019-12-12T03:25:14Z", "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/91D12660-3DEC-467A-BE2A-213B5544DDC0/RESOURCEGROUPS/JUAN-TEST/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.DEVICES/IOTHUBS/JUANHUB1", "operationName": "endpointUnhealthy", "category": "Routes", "level": "Error", "resultType": "403004", "resultDescription": "DeviceMaximumQueueDepthExceeded", "properties": "{\"deviceId\":null,\"endpointName\":\"juan-sb-1\",\"messageId\":null,\"details\":\"DeviceMaximumQueueDepthExceeded\",\"routeName\":null,\"statusCode\":\"403\"}", "location": "westus"} |
|OrphanedMessage|   |Information|Case when message does not match to any route|   |
|EndpointHealthy|   |Information|Endpoint is healthy and receiving messages from IoT Hub. We don’t log this all the time. We log it in the case of a revive; this means we were unable to send messages to the endpoint, but the endpoint is now healthy|   |
|InvalidMessage|   |Error|Message is invalid because of incompatibility with the endpoint|    |

**Throttled logs**

Throttle the log errors to protect from a situation when OperationName/error applies to many messages, to balance COGS. We throttle the following events by logging one occurrence per minute per IotHub.
