# Creating an incremental snapshot (preview) for managed disks

Incremental snapshots (preview) are point in time backups for managed disks that, when taken, consist only of all the changes since the last snapshot. When you attempt to download or otherwise use an incremental snapshot, the full VHD is used. This new capability for managed disk snapshots potentially allows them to be considerably more cost effective, since you are no longer required to store the entire disk with each individual snapshot, unless you choose to. Just like regular snapshots, incremental snapshots can be used to create a full managed disk or, to make a regular snapshot.

There are a few differences between an incremental snapshot and a regular snapshot. Incremental snapshots will always use standard HDDs storage, irrespective of the storage type of the disk, whereas regular snapshots can use premium SSDs. Additionally, incremental snapshots potentially offer better reliability with [zone-redundant storage](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs.md) (ZRS). If ZRS is available in the selected region, an incremental snapshot will use ZRS automatically. If ZRS is not available in the region, then the snapshot will default to [locally-redundant storage](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-lrs.md) (LRS). You can override this behavior and select one manually but, we do not recommend that. In contrast, only LRS is available for regular snapshots.

Incremental snapshots also offer a unique capability: They enable you to perform a diff to get the changes between two incremental snapshots of the same managed disks, down to the block level. You can use this capability to reduce your data footprint when copying snapshots across regions.

## Restrictions

- Incremental snapshots currently cannot be created after you've changed the size of a disk.
- Incremental snapshots currently cannot be moved between subscriptions.
- You can currently only generate SAS URIs of up to five snapshots of a particular snapshot family at any given time.
- When creating a disk from a snapshot, data is copied from that snapshot via a background process. If this background process is incomplete you will be unable to delete the snapshot.
- You cannot create an incremental snapshot for a particular disk outside of that disk's subscription.
- Up to seven incremental snapshots per disk can be created every five minutes.
- A total of 200 incremental snapshots can be created for a single disk.

## CLI
Get the SAS, then get the resource ID of the disk, then use the resource ID to create a incremental snapshot.


## Resource Manager template

Create an incremental snapshot for a managed disk by setting the apiVersion as **2019-03-01** and setting the incremental property to true as shown below. 

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "diskName": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "contosodisk1"
    },
  "diskResourceId": {
    "defaultValue": "<your_managed_disk_resource_ID>",
    "type": "String"
  }
  }, 
  "resources": [
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Compute/snapshots",
    "name": "[concat( parameters('diskName'),'_snapshot1')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "apiVersion": "2019-03-01",
    "properties": {
      "creationData": {
        "createOption": "Copy",
        "sourceResourceId": "[parameters('diskResourceId')]"
      },
      "incremental": true
    }
  }
  ]
}
```

## Next steps

If you haven't yet signed up for the preview and you'd like to start using incremental snapshots, please fill out our [survey](https://aka.ms/mdisnapshotpublicpreview).

Now that you've created an incremental snapshot, you can use it to get the differences between the current and last snapshot.

See our sample for details.
