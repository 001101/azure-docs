## Create a function

The following command creates an HTTP-triggered function named `MyHtpTrigger`.

```bash
func new --name MyHttpTrigger --template "HttpTrigger"
```

When the command executes, you see something like the following output, which in this case is for a JavaScript function:

```output
Writing MyFunctionProj/MyHttpTrigger/index.js
Writing MyFunctionProj/MyHttpTrigger/sample.dat
Writing MyFunctionProj/MyHttpTrigger/function.json
```
