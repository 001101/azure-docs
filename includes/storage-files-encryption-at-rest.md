All data stored in Azure Files is encrypted at rest. This functionality works similarly to how BitLocker works on-premises; data is encrypted beneath the file system level. This means that when you read the data, you don't have to have access to the underlying key to decrypt it at the client side.

By default, data stored in Azure Files is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. This means that Microsoft holds the keys to encrypt/decrypt the data, and is responsible for rotating them on a regular basis. You can also choose to manage your own keys, which gives you control over the rotation process. If you choose to encrypt your file shares with customer-managed keys, Azure Files is authorized to access your keys to fulfill read and write requests from your clients. With customer-managed keys, you can revoke this authorization at any time, but this means that your Azure file share will no longer be accessible via SMB or the FileREST API.

Azure Files uses the same encryption scheme as the other Azure storage services such as Azure Blob storage. To learn more about Azure storage service encryption (SSE), see [Azure storage encryption for data at rest](../common/storage-service-encryption.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ffiles%2ftoc.json).
