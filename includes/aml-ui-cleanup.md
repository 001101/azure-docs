### Delete everything

If you don't plan to use anything you created, delete the entire resource group so you don't incur any charges:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left.

1. From the list, select the resource group you created.

1. On the far right, select the **ellipsis (...)**.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

Deleting the resource group also deletes all resources you created in the visual interface.  

### Delete only compute target

The compute target you created here **automatically autoscales** to zero nodes when not in use to minimize charges.  But, if you want to delete the compute target, use these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your workspace.

1. In the **Compute** section of your workspace, select the resource.

1. Select **Delete**.

### Delete individual assets

In the visual interface where you created your experiment, delete individual assets by selecting them, and then selecting the delete button.
