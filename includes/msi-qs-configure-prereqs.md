If you're unfamiliar with MSI, check out the [Managed Service Identity overview](../articles/active-directory/msi-overview.md).

If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing. In addition, depending on requirements, your account needs to be given at least "Contributor" role membership at "Resource Group" scope. See [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](../articles/active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md) if you need assistance with role assignment.
