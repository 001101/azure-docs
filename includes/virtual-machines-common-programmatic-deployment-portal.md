### Enable programmatic deployment using the portal

One way to enable programmatic deployment is to first deploy the image from the Azure Portal. After you deploy the image manually, the image is automatically enabled for programmatic deployment.

You can also use the portpal to configure the Marketplace image for programmatic deployment. To do this, find the Marketplace image that you want to use. Click **Want to deploy programmatically? Get Started**. Review terms and prices for the offer. Then, select the subscriptions to enable it for programmatic use and click **Save**. 

To view or manage images enabled for programmatic deployment in the portal, click **Subscriptions** > *your subscription* > **Programmatic deployment**.
