### Functions 2.x and higher

```json
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "extensions": {
        "eventHubs": {
            "batchCheckpointFrequency": 5,
            "eventProcessorOptions": {
                "maxBatchSize": 256,
                "prefetchCount": 512
            },
            "initialOffsetOptions": {
                "type": "<fromStart OR fromEnd OR fromEnqueuedTime>",
                "enqueuedTime": "<time in any format supported DateTime.Parse() e.g. 2020-10-26T20:31Z>"
            }
        }
    }
}  
```

|Property  |Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|batchCheckpointFrequency|1|The number of event batches to process before creating an EventHub cursor checkpoint.|
|eventProcessorOptions/maxBatchSize|10|The maximum event count received per receive loop.|
|eventProcessorOptions/prefetchCount|300|The default pre-fetch count used by the underlying `EventProcessorHost`. The minimum allowed value is 10.|
|initialOffsetOptions/type|fromStart|The location in the event stream to start processing from if a checkpoint does not exist in storage. Applies to all partitions.|
|initialOffsetOptions/enqueuedTime|N/A|When "initialOffsetOptions/type" is configured as "fromEnqueuedTime", this field is mandatory.  It specifies the enqueued time of the event in the stream to start processing from. Supports time in any format supported by [DateTime.Parse()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/parsing-datetime) e.g. 2020-10-26T20:31Z. Specifying timezone is recommended for clarity, if timezone is not specified, local timezone of where the function runs is assumed, which is UTC when running on Azure.|

> For more details on how "initialOffsetOptions" works, please refer to the relevant [Azure Event Hubs documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.eventhubs.processor.eventprocessoroptions.initialoffsetprovider?view=azure-dotnet).

```

|Property  |Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
