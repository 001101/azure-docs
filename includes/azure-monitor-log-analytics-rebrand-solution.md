>[!NOTE]
>Previous versions of this article referred to Log Analytics as its own service. Its functionality hasn't changed, but it's been renamed to the log feature of Azure Monitor. This solution also hasn't changed, but with the rename, this article describes its data being stored in a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor. For more information, see [Azure Monitor branding changes](../azure-monitor-rebrand.md).
