The **Principle of Least Privilege** grants an identity only the amount of access needed to perform its job.

Permissions and roles in Role-Based Access Control are inherited from parent roles. Additional permissions and roles can be attached as needed. All such roles should be granted **exactly and no more than the access required** to fulfill their tasks per the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

>[!NOTE]
> **Always follow the Principle of Least Privilege**.

Two other important Role-Based Access Control practices to follow:

* Periodically audit role assignments to verify that each role has the correct permissions.
* Roles and assignments should be cleaned-up as individuals change roles or assignments.
