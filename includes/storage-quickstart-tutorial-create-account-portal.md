## Create a storage account using the Azure portal

First, create a new general-purpose storage account to use for this quickstart. 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in using your Azure account. 
2. On the Hub menu, select **New** > **Storage** > **Storage account - blob, file, table, queue**. 
3. Enter a name for your storage account. The name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only. It must also be unique.
4. Make sure that the following default values are set: 
    - **Deployment model** is set to **Resource manager**.
    - **Account kind** is set to **General purpose**.
    - **Performance** is set to **Standard**.
    - **Replication** is set to **Locally Redundant storage (LRS)**.
    - **Secure transfer required** is set to **Disabled**.
1. Select your subscription. 
2. For **Resource group**, create a new one and give it a unique name. 
3. Select the **Location** to use for your storage account.
4. Check **Pin to dashboard** and click **Create** to create your storage account. 

After your storage account is created, it is pinned to the dashboard. Click on it to open it. Under **Settings**, click **Access keys**. Select a key and copy the **Connection string** to the clipboard, then paste it into a text editor for later use.
