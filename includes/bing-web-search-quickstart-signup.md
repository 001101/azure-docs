Begin using the Bing Web Search API by creating an Azure resource. Choose the resource type below that's right for you:

* A [trial resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api)
    * No Azure subscription needed
    * Valid for seven days, for free. After signing up, a trial key and endpoint will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).

* A [ Bing Search v7 resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAnomalyDetector):
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
    * Use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

* A [Multi-Service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne):
    * Available through the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroupBlade) until you delete the resource.  
    * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Cognitive Services.
