>[!NOTE]
>Previous versions of this article referred to Log Analytics as its own service. Its functionality hasn't changed, but it's [now the log feature  of Azure Monitor](../articles/azure-monitor/azure-monitor-rebrand.md). The term log analytics now refers to the [page in the Azure portal](../articles/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal.md) used to [write and run queries](../articles/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-queries.md) and analyze log data.
