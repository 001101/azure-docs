## Prerequisites

* A [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) account  

Before you can use your GoogleDrive account in a Logic app, you must authorize the Logic app to connect to your GoogleDrive account.Fortunately, you can do this easily from within your Logic app on the Azure Portal.  

Here are the steps to authorize your Logic app to connect to your GoogleDrive account:  

1. To create a connection to Google Drive, in the Logic app designer, select **Show Microsoft managed APIs** in the drop down list then enter *GoogleDrive* in the search box. Select the trigger or action you'll like to use:

2. If you haven't created any connections to GoogleDrive before, you'll get prompted to provide your GoogleDrive credentials. These credentials will be used to authorize your Logic app to connect to, and access your GoogleDrive account's data:
