1. Navigate to the Virtual WAN page. In the portal, click **+Create a resource**. Type **Virtual WAN** into the search box and select Enter.
2. Select **Virtual WAN** from the results. On the Virtual WAN page, click **Create** to open the Create WAN page.
3. On the **Create WAN** page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the following fields:

   * **Subscription** - Select the subscription that you want to use.
   * **Resource Group** - Create new or use existing.
   * **Resource Location** - Choose a resource location from the dropdown. A WAN is a global resource and does not live in a particular region. However, you must select a region in order to more easily manage and locate the WAN resource that you create.
   * **Name** - Type the Name that you want to call your WAN.
   * **Type:** Basic or Standard. If you create a Basic WAN, you can create only a Basic hub. Basic hubs are capable of VPN site-to-site connectivity only.
