Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for Anomaly Detector using the [Azure portal](../articles/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) or [Azure CLI](../articles/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for seven days for free. After signing up, it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).
* Get your endpoint and key by finding your resource on the [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroupBlade), and clicking **Quick start**

>[!NOTE]
> New resources created after July 1, 2019 use the new endpoint format below. For more information and a complete list of regional endpoints, see [Custom subdomain names for Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains):
> * `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com`
