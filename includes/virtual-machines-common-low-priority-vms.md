Using low-priority VMs allows you to take advantage of unused capacity, at a significant cost savings. At any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Azure infrastructure will evict low-priority VMs. Therefore, low-priority VMs are great for workloads that can handle interruptions like batch processing jobs, dev/test environments, large compute workloads, and more.

The amount of available unused capacity can vary based on size, region, time of day, and more. When deploying low-priority VMs on scale sets, Azure will allocate the VMs if there is capacity available, but there is no SLA for these VMs. A low-priority scale set is deployed in a single fault domain and offers no high availability guarantees.

## Eviction Policy

When deploying low-priority VMs, Azure will allocate the VMs if there is capacity available, but there are no SLA guarantees. At any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, we will evict low-priority VMs with 30 seconds notice. 

For the preview, VMs will be evicted based on capacity and the max price you set. When creating low-priority virtual machines, the eviction policy is set to *Deallocate*. The *Deallocate* policy moves your evicted VMs to the stopped-deallocated state, allowing you to redeploy evicted VMs. However, there is no guarantee that the allocation will succeed. The deallocated VMs will count against your vCPU quota and you will be charged for your underlying disks. 

| Option | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Max price is set to >= the current price. | VM is deployed if capacity and quota are available. |
| Max price is set to < the current price. | The VM is not deployed. You will get an error message that the max price needs to be >= current price. |
| Restarting a stop/deallocate VM if the max price is >= the current price | If there is capacity and quota, then the VM is deployed. |
| Restarting a stop/deallocate VM if the max price is < the current price | You will get an error message that the max price needs to be >= current price. | 
| Price for the VM has gone up and is now > the max price. | The VM gets evicted. You get a 30s notification before actual eviction. | 
| After eviction the price for the VM goes back to being < the max price. | The VM will not be automatically re-started. You can restart the VM youself, and it will be charged at the current price. |
| If the max price is set to `-1` | The VM will not be evicted for pricing reasons. The max price will be the current price, up to the price for on-demand VMs. You will never be charged above the on-demand price.| 



## Pricing

Pricing for low-priority VMs is variable, based on region and SKU. For more information, see VM pricing for [Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) and [Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/). 


You can set a max price, in USD, using up to 5 decimal places. For example, the value `0.00432`would be a max price of $0.00432 USD per hour. You can also set the max price to be `-1`, which means that VM won't be evicted based on price. The price for the VM will be the current price for low-priority or the price for an on-demand VM, which ever is less, as long as there is capacity and quota available.

## Use the Azure CLI

The process to create a VM with low-priority using the Azure CLI is the same as detailed in the [getting started article](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli). Just add the '--Priority' parameter and set it to *Low*:

```azurecli
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --priority Low
```

## Use Azure PowerShell

The process to create a low-priority VM using Azure PowerShell is the same as creating other VMs, just add the '-Priority' parameter to the [New-AzVmConfig](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmconfig) portion of the script and set it to *Low*:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$location = "eastus"
$vmName = "myLowPriVM"
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location
$subnetConfig = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name mySubnet -AddressPrefix 192.168.1.0/24
$vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -Name MYvNET -AddressPrefix 192.168.0.0/16 -Subnet $subnetConfig
$pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -Name "mypublicdns$(Get-Random)" -AllocationMethod Static -IdleTimeoutInMinutes 4
$nsgRuleRDP = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name myNetworkSecurityGroupRuleRDP  -Protocol Tcp `
  -Direction Inbound -Priority 1000 -SourceAddressPrefix * -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
  -DestinationPortRange 3389 -Access Allow
$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -Name myNetworkSecurityGroup -SecurityRules $nsgRuleRDP
$nic = New-AzNetworkInterface -Name myNic -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id -NetworkSecurityGroupId $nsg.Id

# Create a virtual machine configuration and set this to be a low-priority VM
$vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName $vmName -VMSize Standard_D1 -Priority "Low" | `
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Windows -ComputerName $vmName -Credential $cred | `
Set-AzVMSourceImage -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer -Offer WindowsServer -Skus 2016-Datacenter -Version latest | `
Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -Id $nic.Id

New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location -VM $vmConfig
```

## Use Azure Resource Manager Templates

For template deployments, use`"apiVersion": "2019-03-01"`. Add the `priority`, `evictionPolicy` and `billingProfile` properties to in your template: 

```json
                "priority": "Low",
                "evictionPolicy": "Deallocate",
                "billingProfile": {
                    "maxPrice": -1
                }
```

Here is a sample template with the added properties for a low-priority VM. Replace the resource names with your own and `<password>` with a password for the local administrator account on the VM.

```json

##  Frequently asked questions

**Q:** Once created, is a low-priority VM the same as regular on-demand VM?
**A:** Yes.

**Q:** What to do when you get evicted, but still need capacity?
**A:** We recommend you use on-demand VMs instead of low-priority VMs if you need capacity right away.

**Q:** How is quota managed for low-priority VMs?
**A:** Low-priority VMs and regular VMs share the same quota pool. 

**Q:** Can I request for additional quota for low-priority?
**A:** Yes, you will be able to submit the request to increase your quota for low priority VMs through the automation tool.

**Q:** Can I use low-priority VMs with Batch?
**A:** Yes, you will be able to use low-priority as part of Batch. Learn more about our low-priority offering on Batch.

**Q:** Can I use low-priority VMs with AKS?
**A:** Not yet. We are working with AKS team to introduce low-priority VM option in AKS.

**Q:** Where can I post questions?
**A:** You can post and tag your question with `azurelowpri` at http://aka.ms/stackoverflow.
