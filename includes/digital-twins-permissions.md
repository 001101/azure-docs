As a solution developer, you might need to create a middle-tier application that is registered in Azure Active Directory and has been [delegated Read/Write access permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-permissions-and-consent) to the Azure Digital Twins Management APIs.

Users will authenticate against the middle-tier application and an Oauth [on-behalf-of](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-on-behalf-of) flow is used to call the actual API downstream. A [full example](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapi-onbehalfof/) demonstrating this is provided.

### Azure Active Directory app registration

1. Follow the steps to [integrate applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v1-integrate-apps-with-azure-ad) and register an application in Azure. Choose **Application type**=`Native` and **Redirect URI**=`https://microsoft.com` as outlined in below images:

1. After app registration is complete, click **Settings** > **Required permissions**:
    - Click **Add** on the top left.
    - Click **Select an API** to use to get external data into Digital Twins.
    - Search for **Azure Smart Spaces Service** API and click **Select**.

    - Click **Select permissions** that your app needs to have to access the correct information.
    - Check the **Read/Write Access** delegated permissions box and click **Select**.
    - Click **Done** and select **Grant permissions**
    - Get the `Application ID` of your Azure Active Directory app and use it to configure `appSettings.json` as `ClientId`:
