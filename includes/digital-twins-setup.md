## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

Also before you start, complete the following setup:
* Get the sample project you'll use in this tutorial by downloading [this repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-building-scenario) as a ZIP file to your machine.
* Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) version 16.5.1XXX or later on your development machine. If you have an older version installed already, you can open the *Visual Studio Installer* app on your machine and follow the prompts to update your installation.
* Run the following command in your Cloud Shell instance to add the Microsoft Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI.
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension add --name azure-iot
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses the newest version of the Azure IoT extension, called `azure-iot`. The legacy version is called `azure-iot-cli-ext`.You should only have one version installed at a time. You can use the command `az extension list` to validate the currently installed extensions.
> Use `az extension remove --name azure-cli-iot-ext` to remove the legacy version of the extension.
> Use `az extension add --name azure-iot` to add the new version of the extension. 
> To see what extensions you have installed, use `az extension list`.

> [!TIP]
> You can run `az dt -h` to see the top-level Azure Digital Twins commands.

## Set up an Azure Digital Twins instance

Begin by logging in, setting the shell context to your subscription, and registering with the Azure Digital Twins namespace.

```azurecli
az account set --subscription <your-subscription-ID>
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.DigitalTwins'
```

Next, run the following commands to create a new Azure resource group for use in this tutorial, and then create a new instance of Azure Digital Twins in this resource group.

```azurecli

az group create --location "westcentralus" --name <name-for-your-resource-group>
az dt create --dt-name <name-for-your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> -g <your-resource-group> -l "westcentralus"
```

The result of these commands looks something like this, outputting information about the resources you've created:
![Command window with successful creation of resource group and Azure Digital Twins instance](../articles/digital-twins-v2/media/include-setup/create-instance.png)

Save the Azure Digital Twins instance's *hostName*, *name*, and *resourceGroup*  from the output. You will use them later.

> [!TIP]
> You can see the properties of your instance at any time by running `az dt show --dt-name <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance>`.

### Assign Azure Active Directory permissions

Azure Digital Twins uses [Azure Active Directory (AAD)](../articles/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) for role-based access control (RBAC). This means that before you can make data plane calls to your Azure Digital Twins instance, you must first assign yourself a role with these permissions.

You also need to make sure your client app can authenticate against Azure Digital Twins, which you'll do by setting up an Azure Active Directory (AAD) app registration.

#### Assign yourself a role

Create a role assignment for yourself using your email associated with the AAD tenant on your Azure subscription. The following command assigns your user to an owner role:

```azurecli
az dt rbac assign-role --dt-name <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --assignee "<your-AAD-email>" --role owner
```

The result of this command is outputted information about the role assignment you've created.

> [!TIP]
> If you get a *400: BadRequest* error instead, run the following commands to get the *ObjectID* for your user:
> ```azurecli
> Connect-AzureAD
> Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId "<your-AAD-email>"
> ```
> Then, repeat the role assignment command using your user's *Object ID* in place of your email.

#### Register your application

To configure an app registration, complete the "Create an app registration" section of [How to authenticate](../articles/digital-twins-v2/how-to-authenticate.md). After doing this, your command window should look something like this:

![New AAD app registration](../articles/digital-twins-v2/media/include-setup/new-app-registration.png)        

Take note of the `appId` value from the output. This is your *Application (client) ID*, and you will use it later.

Next, run this command to take note of your *Directory (tenant) ID*. It appears as `ObjectId` in the command output.

```azurecli
Connect-AzureAD
Get-AzureADTenantDetail
```

You will use both of these values in the next step.

## Configure the sample project

To get started with the sample project, navigate on your local machine to the project folder you downloaded from this repository.

Open _DigitalTwinsMetadata/DigitalTwinsSample/**Program.cs**_, and change `AdtInstanceUrl` to your Azure Digital Twins instance hostName, `ClientId` to your *Application ID*, and `TenantId` to your *Directory ID*.

```csharp
private const string ClientId = "<your-application-ID>";
private const string TenantId = "<your-directory-ID>";
//...
const string AdtInstanceUrl = "https://<your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostName>"
```

Save the file.
