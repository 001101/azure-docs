## <a name="create-an-azure-functions-project"></a>Create your local project 

The Azure Functions project template in Visual Studio Code creates a project that can be published to a function app in Azure. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for management, deployment, and sharing of resources.

1. In Visual Studio Code, press F1 to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select `Azure Functions: Create new project...`.

1. Choose a directory location for your project workspace and choose **Select**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > These steps were designed to be completed outside of a workspace. In this case, do not select a project folder that is part of a workspace.

1. Following the prompts, provide the following information for your desired language:

    # [C\#](#tab/csharp)

    | Prompt | Value | Description |

Visual Studio Code creates the function app project in a new workspace. This project contains the [host.json](../articles/azure-functions/functions-host-json.md) and [local.settings.json](../articles/azure-functions/functions-run-local.md#local-settings-file) configuration files, plus any language-specific project files. 

A new HTTP triggered function is also created in the HttpTrigger folder of the function app project.
