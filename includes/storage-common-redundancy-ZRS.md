Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) is designed to simplify the development of highly available applications. ZRS provides durability for storage objects of at least 99.9999999999% (twelve 9's) over a given year. ZRS replicates your data synchronously across multiple availability zones. Consider ZRS for scenarios like transactional applications where downtime is not acceptable.

ZRS enables customers to read and write data even if a single zone is unavailable or unrecoverable. Inserts and updates to data are made synchronously and are strongly consistent.   

ZRS is currently available for preview in the following regions, with more regions coming soon:

- US East 2 
- US Central 
- Europe North
- France Central
