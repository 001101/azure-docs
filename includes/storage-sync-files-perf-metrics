| Initial one-time provisioning  |  |
|----------|--------------|
| Number of objects | 10 million objects | 
| Dataset Size| ~4 TB |
| Average File Size | ~500 KB (Largest File: 100GB) |
| Upload Throughput | 15 objects per second |
| Namespace Download Throughput* | 350 objects per second |

*When a new server endpoint is created, the Azure File Sync agent does not download any of the file content. It first syncs the full namespace and then triggers background recall to download the files, either in their entirety or, if cloud tiering is enabled, to the cloud tiering policy set on the server endpoint.

| Full Download Throughput* | 30 objects per second |
 
If cloud tiering is enabled, you are likely to observe better performance as only some of the file data is downloaded. Azure File Sync only downloads the data of cached files when they are changed on any of the endpoints. For any tiered or newly created files, the agent does not download the file data, and instead only syncs the namespace to all the server endpoints. The agent also supports partial downloads of tiered files as they are accessed by the user.
