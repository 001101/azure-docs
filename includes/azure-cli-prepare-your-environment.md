## Prepare your environment

1. Do a [local install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) of the Azure CLI, or start [Azure Cloud Shell](/cli/azure/start-azure-cloud-shell).
1. Sign in using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command if you're using a local install.  Follow the steps displayed in your terminal to complete the authentication process.  See [Sign in with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) for additional sign in options.
1. If you don't have a resource group, create one using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.  See [What is Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) to learn more about resource groups.
