The snippet uses the [Room.json](/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/blob/master/AdtSampleApp/SampleClientApp/Models/Room.json) and [Floor.json](/azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/blob/master/AdtSampleApp/SampleClientApp/Models/Floor.json) model definitions from [*Tutorial: Explore Azure Digital Twins with a sample client app*](../articles/digital-twins/tutorial-command-line-app.md). You can use these links to go directly to the files, or download them as part of the full end-to-end sample project [here](/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples/digital-twins-samples/).

Replace the placeholder `<your-instance-hostname>` with your Azure Digital Twins instance details and run the sample.
