## Get SQL server connection information
-->

Get the connection information you need to connect to the Azure SQL database. You'll need the fully qualified server name or host name, database name, and login information for the upcoming procedures.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Navigate to the **SQL databases**  or **SQL managed instances** page.

3. On the **Overview** page, review the fully qualified server name next to **Server name** for a single database or the fully qualified server name next to **Host** for a managed instance. To copy the server name or host name, hover over it and select the **Copy** icon.
