The Azure portal monitors the throughput, storage, availability, latency, and consistency of the resources in your Cosmos DB account. Each chart that's associated with an [Azure Cosmos DB Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cosmos-db/) provides a line that shows whether performance met the SLA. Azure Cosmos DB makes monitoring your SLAs easy with this suite of metrics.

To review the metrics and SLAs: 

1. Select **Metrics** in your Cosmos DB account's navigation menu.
   
2. Select the **Latency** tab, and select a timeframe on the right. Compare the **Actual** and **SLA** lines on each chart.

3. Review the metrics on the other tabs.
