1. In your browser, navigate to your Jenkins VM. The URL of the Jenkins VM will be the value you entered for the **Domain name label** when creating the Jenkins VM. Since the Jenkins dashboard is inaccessible through unsecured HTTP, a message displays indicating that you need to use SSH to first tunnel into the VM.







1. Navigate to your virtual machine (for example, http://jenkins2517454.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/) in  your web browser. The Jenkins console is inaccessible through unsecured HTTP so instructions are provided on the page to access the Jenkins console securely from your computer using an SSH tunnel.

Set up the tunnel using the `ssh` command on the page from the command line, replacing `username` with the name of the virtual machine admin user chosen earlier when setting up the virtual machine from the solution template.

```bash
ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:localhost:8080 jenkinsadmin@jenkins2517454.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
```

After you have started the tunnel, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ on your local machine. 

Get the initial password by running the following command in the command line while connected through SSH to the Jenkins VM.

```bash
`sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.
```

Unlock the Jenkins dashboard for the first time using this initial password.
