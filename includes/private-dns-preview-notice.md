> The Azure DNS Private Zone feature is currently a managed preview, and requires you to use a preview Powershell module/SDK that is be provided when you sign up for the Preview. This Preview is provided without a service level agreement and should not be used for production workloads. Certain features may not be supported, may have constrained capabilities, or may not be available in all Azure locations.  See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for details.

To sign up for this preview, email [AzureDNS-PrivateZone@microsoft.com](mailto:AzureDNS-PrivateZone@microsoft.com) with your subscription details. The examples in this article assume that you have already signed up for the Preview and have obtained the preview Powershell module/SDK. Using the current Public Powershell module does not work for this preview feature.
