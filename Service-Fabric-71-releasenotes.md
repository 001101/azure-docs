## Key Annoucements
- [Service Fabric Backup Explorer](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric-backup-explorer):  To ease management of Reliable Collections backup for Service Fabric Stateful applications, we are announcing public preview of Service Fabric Backup Explorer. It is a utility that  enables users to i)Audit and review the contents of the Reliable Collections, ii) update current state to a consistent view, iii) create Backup of the current snapshot of the Reliable Collections and iv) Fix data corruption.
- Endpoint certificates of Service Fabric applications can be declared by subject common name.
  

## Breaking Changes
- For customers using service fabric managed identities, **please switch to new environment variables ‘IDENTITY_ENDPOINT’ and ‘IDENTITY_HEADER’**. The prior environment variables'MSI_ENDPOINT' and 'MSI_SECRET' are now removed.
- Service Fabric Managed Identity endpoint is now secure(HTTPs). There is additional guidance on how to validate the MITS server certificate in the docs.

## Service Fabric Runtime

| Versions | IssueType | Description | Resolution | 
|----------|-----------|-|-|
| **Windows 7.1.*   <br> Ubuntu 7.1.*** | **Feature** | VeryHigh service move cost | **Brief desc** We have introduced new move cost value VeryHigh that provides additional flexibility in some usage scenarios. For more details please consult the [Service movement cost](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-movement-cost) documentation.
| **Windows 7.1.** | **Bug** | Account created alerts | **Brief desc** In certain SF cluster configurations, the runtime would create user accounts with random names that would raise security alerts. These accounts now have standardized names with "WF-" prefix which can be used to identify them as Service Fabric accounts. This should stop automated alerts from being raised on these accounts.
| **Windows 7.1.*   <br> Ubuntu 7.1.*** | **Bug** | Subclustered balancing | **Brief desc** Improved balancing for subclustered metrics which previously caused suboptimal balancing in some situations. For more information, see [Subclustering documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/cluster-resource-manager-subclustering).
| **Windows 7.1.** | **Feature** | SSL certs declared by CN | **Brief desc** Application endpoint certificates can be declared by subject common name to enable auto-rollover. For more details please refer to [specifying endpoints in service manifest](https::/docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-service-manifest-resources.md).
| **Ubuntu 7.1.*** | **Feature** | Custom cipher list | **Brief desc** Config setting TLS1_2_CipherList can now be used to configure a custom cipher list on Linux. See [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-fabric-settings) for details.


## Service Fabric Common Bug Fixes

| Versions | IssueType | Description | Resolution | 
|-|-|-|-|
| **Windows 7.1.*** | **Bug** |Improve DNS intermittent resolve errors|**Brief desc**: Intermittent resolve shows up as short periods of time where a resolve will timeout or be unable to correctly statisfy a request.  <br> **Impact**: Causes interruptions in service for customers. <br> **Workaround**: Wait for it to self correct or apply a patch script. <br> **How/When to Consume it**: In fabric settings, set the Hosting parameter DnsServerListTwoIps to true. **Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-fabric-settings#dnsservice| 
| ***Windows 7.1.*   <br> Ubuntu 7.1.** | **Bug** | Add aligned affinity support to Move primary replica API | **Brief desc**: Service Fabric supports service affinity and also provides management and troubleshooting APIs such as the ability to manually move a primary (https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient.faultmanagementclient.moveprimaryasync?view=azure-dotnet) from one node to another. However, operations to move a primary that was a part of an aligned affinity relationship would only move the specific targeted primary, temporarially breaking the affinity relationship. In order to help ensure high availability, in Service Fabric v7.1 we improve the MovePrimary API to take aligned affinity into consideration. With this change, if the primary to be moved is a part of an aligned affinity relationship, then all the replicas in that relationship will be moved together. With this change, the API can now return a new exception in the case that the primary replicas of such services are only partially able to move within specified timeout: FabricErrorCode.AsyncOperationNotComplete. This means that the services will temporarily be in a torn aligned affinity state. If this happens customer is advised to issue the operation again.<br> **Impact**: Service unavailability<br> **Workaround**: Manually move all individual primary replicas in aligned affinity correlation<br> **How/When to Consume it**: Issue Move primary replica operation for primary replica in aligned affinity correlation.
| **Windows 7.1.*** | **Bug** | Backup policy operation works in wrong way when '/' is there in entity name | **Brief desc**: Few of backup policy operations used to work improperly when there is '/' in the application name.  <br> **Impact**: Operations like enable backup, suspend backup and retention management were impacted because of this and all the operations are fixed with this release.<br> **Workaround**: N/A. <br> **How/When to Consume it**: Upgrade the service fabric cluster to 7.1. This fix should only be consumed when user has '/' in application name or service name and also using Backup Restore service to configure backup policy for that application. 
| **Windows 7.1.*** | **Bug** |Backup restore operations failed to work on FIPS compliant system.|**Brief desc**: Backup restore service was using non-FIPS compliant APIs in backup workflow and due to this few operations used to fail on FIPS compliant system.  <br> **Impact**: This impacted complete backup flow when azure blob was used as storage and it is fixed with this release. <br> **Workaround**: N/A. <br> **How/When to Consume it**: Upgrade the service fabric cluster to 7.1. This fix should only be consumed when Backup restore service is being used in FIPS compliant system.
| **Windows 7.1.*** | **Bug** |Fix trace upload on FIPS enabled machines|**Brief desc**:  DCA does not upload to azure storage on FIPS enabled machines. The fix changes the default MD5 algorithm used by the storage api so that it is compliant.  <br> **Impact**: Causes trace upload to fail.
